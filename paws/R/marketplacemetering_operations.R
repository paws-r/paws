#' 
#' For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried

#'
#' Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
#' integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
#' RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Calling
#' RegisterUsage from containers running outside of ECS is not currently
#' supported. Free and BYOL products for ECS aren\'t required to call
#' RegisterUsage, but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive
#' usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the
#' behavior of RegisterUsage. RegisterUsage performs two primary functions:
#' metering and entitlement.
#' 
#' -   *Entitlement*: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the customer
#'     running your paid software is subscribed to your product on AWS
#'     Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your
#'     container image that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required
#'     to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a
#'     CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will
#'     only be thrown on the initial call to RegisterUsage. Subsequent
#'     calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) will not
#'     throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer
#'     unsubscribes while the Amazon ECS task is still running.
#' 
#' -   *Metering*: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per
#'     hour, with usage prorated to the second. A minimum of 1 minute of
#'     usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a
#'     customer has a 10 node ECS cluster and creates an ECS service
#'     configured as a Daemon Set, then ECS will launch a task on all 10
#'     cluster nodes and the customer will be charged: (10 \*
#'     hourly\\_rate). Metering for software use is automatically handled by
#'     the AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane \\-- your software is not
#'     required to perform any metering specific actions, other than call
#'     RegisterUsage once for metering of software use to commence. The AWS
#'     Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill
#'     customers for running ECS tasks, regardless of the customers
#'     subscription state, removing the need for your software to perform
#'     entitlement checks at runtime.
