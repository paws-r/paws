#' The CustomerIdentifier parameter is scheduled for deprecation on March

#'
#' @description
#' The `CustomerIdentifier` parameter is scheduled for deprecation on March
#' 31, 2026. Use `CustomerAWSAccountID` instead.
#' 
#' These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can't specify both
#' `CustomerIdentifier` and `CustomerAWSAccountID` in the same request.
#' 
#' To post metering records for customers, SaaS applications call
#' [`batch_meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_batch_meter_usage], which is
#' used for metering SaaS flexible consumption pricing (FCP). Identical
#' requests are idempotent and can be retried with the same records or a
#' subset of records. Each
#' [`batch_meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_batch_meter_usage] request is
#' for only one product. If you want to meter usage for multiple products,
#' you must make multiple
#' [`batch_meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_batch_meter_usage] calls.
#' 
#' Usage records should be submitted in quick succession following a
#' recorded event. Usage records aren't accepted 6 hours or more after an
#' event.
#' 
#' [`batch_meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_batch_meter_usage] can process
#' up to 25 `UsageRecords` at a time, and each request must be less than 1
#' MB in size. Optionally, you can have multiple usage allocations for
#' usage data that's split into buckets according to predefined tags.
#' 
#' [`batch_meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_batch_meter_usage] returns a
#' list of `UsageRecordResult` objects, which have each `UsageRecord`. It
#' also returns a list of `UnprocessedRecords`, which indicate errors on
#' the service side that should be retried.
#' 
#' For Amazon Web Services Regions that support
#' [`batch_meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_batch_meter_usage], see
#' [BatchMeterUsage Region
#' support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#batchmeterusage-region-support).

#' API to emit metering records
#'
#' @description
#' API to emit metering records. For identical requests, the API is
#' idempotent and returns the metering record ID. This is used for metering
#' flexible consumption pricing (FCP) Amazon Machine Images (AMI) and
#' container products.
#' 
#' [`meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_meter_usage] is authenticated on the
#' buyer's Amazon Web Services account using credentials from the Amazon
#' EC2 instance, Amazon ECS task, or Amazon EKS pod.
#' 
#' [`meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_meter_usage] can optionally include
#' multiple usage allocations, to provide customers with usage data split
#' into buckets by tags that you define (or allow the customer to define).
#' 
#' Submit usage records to report events from the previous hour. If you
#' submit records that are greater than six hours after events occur, the
#' records won’t be accepted. The timestamp in your request determines when
#' an event is recorded. You can only report usage once per hour for each
#' dimension. For AMI-based products, this is per dimension and per EC2
#' instance. For container products, this is per dimension and per ECS task
#' or EKS pod. You can’t modify values after they’re recorded. If you
#' report usage before the current hour ends, you will be unable to report
#' additional usage until the next hour begins.
#' 
#' For Amazon Web Services Regions that support
#' [`meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_meter_usage], see [MeterUsage Region
#' support for Amazon
#' EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#meterusage-region-support-ec2)
#' and [MeterUsage Region support for Amazon ECS and Amazon
#' EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#meterusage-region-support-ecs-eks).

#' @usage
#' marketplacemetering_meter_usage(ProductCode, Timestamp, UsageDimension,
#'   UsageQuantity, DryRun, UsageAllocations, ClientToken)
#'
#' @param ProductCode &#91;required&#93; Product code is used to uniquely identify a product in Amazon Web
#' Services Marketplace. The product code should be the same as the one
#' used during the publishing of a new product.
#' @param Timestamp &#91;required&#93; Timestamp, in UTC, for which the usage is being reported. Your
#' application can meter usage for up to six hours in the past. Make sure
#' the `timestamp` value is not before the start of the software usage.
#' @param UsageDimension &#91;required&#93; It will be one of the fcp dimension name provided during the publishing
#' of the product.
#' @param UsageQuantity Consumption value for the hour. Defaults to `0` if not specified.
#' @param DryRun Checks whether you have the permissions required for the action, but
#' does not make the request. If you have the permissions, the request
#' returns `DryRunOperation`; otherwise, it returns
#' `UnauthorizedException`. Defaults to `false` if not specified.
#' @param UsageAllocations The set of `UsageAllocations` to submit.
#' 
#' The sum of all `UsageAllocation` quantities must equal the
#' `UsageQuantity` of the [`meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_meter_usage]
#' request, and each `UsageAllocation` must have a unique set of tags
#' (include no tags).
#' @param ClientToken Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
#' the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request
#' without accidentally performing the same operation a second time.
#' Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you
#' also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you
#' use a [UUID type of
#' value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).
#' 
#' If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a
#' random one for you.
#' 
#' If you retry the operation with the same `ClientToken`, but with
#' different parameters, the retry fails with an
#' `IdempotencyConflictException` error.

#' Paid container software products sold through Amazon Web Services
#' Marketplace must integrate with the Amazon Web Services Marketplace
#' Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage operation for software
#' entitlement and metering
#'
#' @description
#' Paid container software products sold through Amazon Web Services
#' Marketplace must integrate with the Amazon Web Services Marketplace
#' Metering Service and call the
#' [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] operation for
#' software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS
#' or Amazon EKS aren't required to call
#' [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage], but you may
#' choose to do so if you would like to receive usage data in your seller
#' reports. The sections below explain the behavior of
#' [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage].
#' [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] performs two
#' primary functions: metering and entitlement.
#' 
#' -   *Entitlement*:
#'     [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] allows you to
#'     verify that the customer running your paid software is subscribed to
#'     your product on Amazon Web Services Marketplace, enabling you to
#'     guard against unauthorized use. Your container image that integrates
#'     with [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] is only
#'     required to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as
#'     such a `CustomerNotSubscribedException` or
#'     `PlatformNotSupportedException` will only be thrown on the initial
#'     call to [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage].
#'     Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g.
#'     task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not throw a
#'     `CustomerNotSubscribedException`, even if the customer unsubscribes
#'     while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.
#' 
#' -   *Metering*: [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage]
#'     meters software use per ECS task, per hour, or per pod for Amazon
#'     EKS with usage prorated to the second. A minimum of 1 minute of
#'     usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a
#'     customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a
#'     service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS
#'     will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will be
#'     charged for 10 tasks. Software metering is handled by the Amazon Web
#'     Services Marketplace metering control plane—your software is not
#'     required to perform metering-specific actions other than to call
#'     [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] to commence
#'     metering. The Amazon Web Services Marketplace metering control plane
#'     will also bill customers for running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods,
#'     regardless of the customer's subscription state, which removes the
#'     need for your software to run entitlement checks at runtime. For
#'     containers, [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage]
#'     should be called immediately at launch. If you don’t register the
#'     container within the first 6 hours of the launch, Amazon Web
#'     Services Marketplace Metering Service doesn’t provide any metering
#'     guarantees for previous months. Metering will continue, however, for
#'     the current month forward until the container ends.
#'     [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] is for
#'     metering paid hourly container products.
#' 
#'     For Amazon Web Services Regions that support
#'     [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage], see
#'     [RegisterUsage Region
#'     support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#registerusage-region-support).
