#' AWS Health APIs and Notifications
#'
#' @description
#' Health
#' 
#' The Health API provides programmatic access to the Health information
#' that appears in the [Personal Health
#' Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home#/). You can use the
#' API operations to get information about events that might affect your
#' Amazon Web Services services and resources.
#' 
#' -   You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
#'     plan from [Amazon Web Services
#'     Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/) to use the Health
#'     API. If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services account
#'     that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
#'     Support plan, you receive a `SubscriptionRequiredException` error.
#' 
#' -   You can use the Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
#'     (HTTPS) to call the Health API operations. Health supports a
#'     multi-Region application architecture and has two regional endpoints
#'     in an active-passive configuration. You can use the high
#'     availability endpoint example to determine which Amazon Web Services
#'     Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from
#'     the API. For more information, see [Accessing the Health
#'     API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html)
#'     in the *Health User Guide*.
#' 
#' For authentication of requests, Health uses the [Signature Version 4
#' Signing
#' Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing-aws-api-requests.html).
#' 
#' If your Amazon Web Services account is part of Organizations, you can
#' use the Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a
#' centralized view of Health events across all accounts in your
#' organization. You can aggregate Health events in real time to identify
#' accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event
#' or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view
#' API operations to enable this feature and return event information. For
#' more information, see [Aggregating Health
#' events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html)
#' in the *Health User Guide*.
#' 
#' When you use the Health API operations to return Health events, see the
#' following recommendations:
#' 
#' -   Use the
#'     [eventScopeCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode)
#'     parameter to specify whether to return Health events that are public
#'     or account-specific.
#' 
#' -   Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if
#'     you call the
#'     [`describe_events_for_organization`][health_describe_events_for_organization]
#'     operation to get all events in your organization, you might receive
#'     several page results. Specify the `nextToken` in the next request to
#'     return more results.
#'
#' @param
#' config
#' Optional configuration of credentials, endpoint, and/or region.
#' \itemize{
#' \item{\strong{access_key_id}:} {AWS access key ID}
#' \item{\strong{secret_access_key}:} {AWS secret access key}
#' \item{\strong{session_token}:} {AWS temporary session token}
#' \item{\strong{profile}:} {The name of a profile to use. If not given, then the default profile is used.}
#' \item{\strong{anonymous}:} {Set anonymous credentials.}
#' \item{\strong{endpoint}:} {The complete URL to use for the constructed client.}
#' \item{\strong{region}:} {The AWS Region used in instantiating the client.}
#' \item{\strong{close_connection}:} {Immediately close all HTTP connections.}
#' \item{\strong{timeout}:} {The time in seconds till a timeout exception is thrown when attempting to make a connection. The default is 60 seconds.}
#' \item{\strong{s3_force_path_style}:} {Set this to `true` to force the request to use path-style addressing, i.e., `http://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET/KEY`.}
