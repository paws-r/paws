#' AWS WAFV2
#'
#' @description
#' This is the latest version of the **AWS WAF** API, released in November,
#' 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like
#' endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added,
#' like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend
#' migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of
#' significant improvements.
#' 
#' If you used AWS WAF prior to this release, you can't use this AWS WAFV2
#' API to access any AWS WAF resources that you created before. You can
#' access your old rules, web ACLs, and other AWS WAF resources only
#' through the AWS WAF Classic APIs. The AWS WAF Classic APIs have retained
#' the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces.
#' 
#' For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources to this
#' version, see the [AWS WAF Developer
#' Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html).
#' 
#' AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and
#' HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API
#' Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS AppSync
#' GraphQL API. AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based
#' on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests
#' originate from or the values of query strings, the API Gateway REST API,
#' CloudFront distribution, the Application Load Balancer, or the AWS
#' AppSync GraphQL API responds to requests either with the requested
#' content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can
#' configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is
#' blocked.
#' 
#' This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS
#' WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about
#' AWS WAF features and an overview of how to use AWS WAF, see the [AWS WAF
#' Developer
#' Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/).
#' 
#' You can make calls using the endpoints listed in [AWS Service Endpoints
#' for AWS
#' WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#waf_region).
#' 
#' -   For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the
#'     list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer
#'     (ALB), an API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API.
#' 
#' -   For AWS CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint
#'     listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.
#' 
#' Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's
#' tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
#' more information, see [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).
#' 
#' We currently provide two versions of the AWS WAF API: this API and the
#' prior versions, the classic AWS WAF APIs. This new API provides the same
#' functionality as the older versions, with the following major
#' improvements:
#' 
#' -   You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you
#'     need to distinguish the scope, you specify a `Scope` parameter and
#'     set it to `CLOUDFRONT` or `REGIONAL`.
#' 
#' -   You can define a Web ACL or rule group with a single call, and
#'     update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in
#'     JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or Web ACL calls.
#' 
#' -   The limits AWS WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects
#'     the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity
#'     settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use
#'     it.
#'
#' @param
#' config
#' Optional configuration of credentials, endpoint, and/or region.
#'
#' @section Service syntax:
#' ```
#' svc <- wafv2(
#'   config = list(
#'     credentials = list(
#'       creds = list(
#'         access_key_id = "string",
#'         secret_access_key = "string",
#'         session_token = "string"
