#' Running PutPermission permits the specified AWS account or AWS

#'
#' Running `PutPermission` permits the specified AWS account or AWS

#' CloudWatch Events rules in your account are triggered by these events
#' arriving to your default event bus.
#' 
#' For another account to send events to your account, that external

#' If you specify \"\*\" without specifying `Condition`, avoid creating

#' Creates or updates the specified rule
#'
#' Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or
#' based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using DisableRule.
#' 
#' If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you
#' specify in this `PutRule` command. If you omit arguments in `PutRule`,
#' the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are
#' replaced with null values.
#' 
#' When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately
#' start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for
#' changes to take effect.
#' 
#' A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression.
#' Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is
#' observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given
#' schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression,
#' in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a
#' schedule.
#' 
#' Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon
#' Resource Names (ARNs). However, CloudWatch Events uses an exact match in
#' event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when
#' creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event
#' you want to match.
#' 
#' In CloudWatch Events, it is possible to create rules that lead to
#' infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule
#' might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger
#' software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written
#' carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again,
#' creating an infinite loop.
#' 
#' To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not
#' re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs
#' are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
#' 
#' An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We
#' recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed
#' your specified limit. For more information, see [Managing Your Costs
#' with
#' Budgets](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-managing-costs.html).

#'
#' Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets
#' if they are already associated with the rule.
#' 
#' Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.
#' 
#' You can configure the following as targets for CloudWatch Events:
#' 
#' -   EC2 instances
#' 
#' -   SSM Run Command
#' 
#' -   SSM Automation
#' 
#' -   AWS Lambda functions
#' 
#' -   Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
#' 
#' -   Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
#' 
#' -   Amazon ECS tasks
#' 
#' -   AWS Step Functions state machines
#' 
#' -   AWS Batch jobs
#' 
#' -   AWS CodeBuild projects
#' 
#' -   Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline
#' 
#' -   Amazon Inspector assessment templates
#' 
#' -   Amazon SNS topics
#' 
#' -   Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues
#' 
#' -   The default event bus of another AWS account
#' 
#' Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS
#' Management Console. The built-in targets are
#' `EC2 CreateSnapshot API call`, `EC2 RebootInstances API call`,
#' `EC2 StopInstances API call`, and `EC2 TerminateInstances API call`.
#' 
#' For some target types, `PutTargets` provides target-specific parameters.
#' If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which
#' shard the event goes to by using the `KinesisParameters` argument. To
#' invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use
#' the `RunCommandParameters` field.
#' 
#' To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon
#' CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and
#' Amazon SNS resources, CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based
#' policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, and AWS Step
#' Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles that you
#' specify in the `RoleARN` argument in `PutTargets`. For more information,
#' see [Authentication and Access
#' Control](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/auth-and-access-control-cwe.html)
#' in the *Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide*.
#' 
#' If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you
#' permission (using `PutPermission`), you can send events to that account.
#' Set that account\'s event bus as a target of the rules in your account.
#' To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account\'s
#' event bus as the `Arn` value when you run `PutTargets`. If your account
#' sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent
#' event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event.
#' The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information,
#' see [Amazon CloudWatch
#' Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).
#' 
#' If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and
#' that account granted permission to your account through an organization
#' instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a `RoleArn`
#' with proper permissions in the `Target` structure. For more information,
#' see [Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS
#' Accounts](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CloudWatchEvents-CrossAccountEventDelivery.html)
#' in the *Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide*.
#' 
#' For more information about enabling cross-account events, see
#' PutPermission.
#' 
#' **Input**, **InputPath**, and **InputTransformer** are mutually
#' exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered
#' due to a matched event:
#' 
#' -   If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then
#'     the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the
#'     target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case
#'     nothing from the event is passed to the target).
#' 
#' -   If **Input** is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the
#'     matched event is overridden with this constant.
#' 
#' -   If **InputPath** is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example,
#'     `$.detail`), then only the part of the event specified in the path
#'     is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the
#'     event is passed).
#' 
#' -   If **InputTransformer** is specified, then one or more specified
#'     JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a
