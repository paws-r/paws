#' @description
#' AWS Marketplace Metering Service
#' 
#' This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace
#' Metering Service API.
#' 
#' AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom
#' usage dimensions.
#' 
#' **Submitting Metering Records**
#' 
#' -   *MeterUsage*- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product.
#'     MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container running on
#'     EKS or ECS.
#' 
#' -   *BatchMeterUsage*- Submits the metering record for a set of
#'     customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service
#'     (SaaS) application.
#' 
#' **Accepting New Customers**
#' 
#' -   *ResolveCustomer*- Called by a SaaS application during the
#'     registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the
#'     registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through
#'     the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to
#'     obtain a CustomerIdentifier and Product Code.
#' 
#' **Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products**
#' 
#' -   Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
#'     integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
#'     RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free
#'     and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren\'t required to
#'     call RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage
#'     data in your seller reports. For more information on using the
#'     RegisterUsage operation, see [Container-Based
#'     Products](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html).
#' 
#' BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use
#' Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are
#' accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage.
#' You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more
#' information, see the *[AWS CloudTrail User
#' Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html)*
