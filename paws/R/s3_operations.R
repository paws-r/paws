#' This operation aborts a multipart upload
#'
#' @description
#' This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is
#' aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The
#' storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed.
#' However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part
#' uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary
#' to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely
#' free all storage consumed by all parts.
#' 
#' To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for
#' the part storage, you should call the [`list_parts`][s3_list_parts]
#' operation and ensure that the parts list is empty.

#' @description
#' Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.
#' 
#' You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using
#' the [`upload_part`][s3_upload_part] operation. After successfully
#' uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this operation to
#' complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates
#' all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object.
#' In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts
#' list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This operation
#' concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in
#' the list, you must provide the part number and the `ETag` value,
#' returned after that part was uploaded.
#' 
#' Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several
#' minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it
#' sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While
#' processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space
#' characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request
#' could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is
#' important that you check the response body to determine whether the
#' request succeeded.
#' 
#' Note that if [`complete_multipart_upload`][s3_complete_multipart_upload]
#' fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests. For
#' more information, see [Amazon S3 Error Best
#' Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ErrorBestPractices.html).

#' Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.
#' 
#' You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create
#' a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation
#' using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must
#' use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information,
#' see [Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload
#' API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CopyingObjctsMPUapi.html).
#' 
#' All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have
#' *read* access to the source object and *write* access to the destination
#' bucket. For more information, see [REST
#' Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html).
#' Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region
#' that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.
#' 
#' A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy
#' request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs
#' before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3
#' error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response
#' is embedded in the `200 OK` response. This means that a `200 OK`
#' response can contain either a success or an error. Design your
#' application to parse the contents of the response and handle it
#' appropriately.
#' 
#' If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about
#' the copied object.
#' 
#' If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If
#' it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need
#' to read the entire body.
#' 
#' The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that
#' you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see
#' [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).
#' 
#' Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If
#' you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint,
#' you get a 400 `Bad Request` error. For more information, see [Transfer
#' Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html).
#' 
#' **Metadata**
#' 
#' When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or
#' specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to
#' private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL
#' setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more
#' information, see [Using
#' ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl_overview.html).
#' 
#' To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source
#' object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can
#' optionally add the `x-amz-metadata-directive` header. When you grant
#' permissions, you can use the `s3:x-amz-metadata-directive` condition key
#' to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more
#' information, see [Specifying Conditions in a
#' Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*. For a complete list of Amazon
#' S3-specific condition keys, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys
#' for Amazon
#' S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/list_amazons3.html).
#' 
#' **`x-amz-copy-source-if` Headers**
#' 
#' To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the
#' `Etag` matches or whether the object was modified before or after a
#' specified date, use the following request parameters:
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`
#' 
#' If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` and
#' `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in the
#' request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies
#' the data:
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to true
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to false
#' 
#' If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and
#' `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the request
#' and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the `412 Precondition Failed`
#' response code:
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to false
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to true
#' 
#' All headers with the `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`,
#' must be signed.
#' 
#' **Server-side encryption**
#' 
#' When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the
#' appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using
#' server-side encryption with AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or
#' SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side
#' encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
#' data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more
#' information about server-side encryption, see [Using Server-Side
#' Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html).
#' 
#' If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the
#' object. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Bucket
#' Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-key.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**
#' 
#' When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant
#' ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the
#' owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant
#' permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
#' by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object.
#' For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL)
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html)
#' and [Managing ACLs Using the REST
#' API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/managing-acls.html).
#' 
#' **Storage Class Options**
#' 
#' You can use the [`copy_object`][s3_copy_object] operation to change the
#' storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the
#' `StorageClass` parameter. For more information, see [Storage
#' Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Versioning**
#' 
#' By default, `x-amz-copy-source` identifies the current version of an
#' object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3
#' behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use
#' the `versionId` subresource.
#' 
#' If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a
#' unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is
#' different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns
#' the version ID of the copied object in the `x-amz-version-id` response
#' header in the response.
#' 
#' If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the
#' version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.
#' 
#' If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy
#' of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy
#' operation. For more information, see
#' [`restore_object`][s3_restore_object].
#' 
#' The following operations are related to [`copy_object`][s3_copy_object]:
#' 
#' -   [`put_object`][s3_put_object]
#'

#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
#' to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
#' form
#' *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
#' When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you
#' provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more

#' Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param CacheControl Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
#' @param ContentDisposition Specifies presentational information for the object.
#' @param ContentEncoding Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
#' thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
#' referenced by the Content-Type header field.
#' @param ContentLanguage The language the content is in.
#' @param ContentType A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.
#' @param CopySource &#91;required&#93; Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
#' value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the
#' source object through an [access
#' point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html):
#' 
#' -   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
#'     of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by
#'     a slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf`
#'     from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
#'     `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL
#'     encoded.
#' 
#' -   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
#'     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
#'     point, in the format
#'     `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`.
#'     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access
#'     point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
#'     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
#'     `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.
#'     The value must be URL encoded.
#' 
#'     Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the
#'     source and destination buckets are in the same AWS Region.
#' 
#'     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
#'     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
#'     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`.
#'     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
#'     outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
#'     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
#'     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.
#'     The value must be URL encoded.
#' 
#' To copy a specific version of an object, append
#' `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
#' `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).
#' If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version
#' of the source object.
#' @param CopySourceIfMatch Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.
#' @param CopySourceIfModifiedSince Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.
#' @param CopySourceIfNoneMatch Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the
#' specified ETag.
#' @param CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.
#' @param Expires The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.
#' @param GrantFullControl Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the
#' object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantRead Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantReadACP Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantWriteACP Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param Key &#91;required&#93; The key of the destination object.
#' @param Metadata A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
#' @param MetadataDirective Specifies whether the metadata is copied from the source object or
#' replaced with metadata provided in the request.
#' @param TaggingDirective Specifies whether the object tag-set are copied from the source object
#' or replaced with tag-set provided in the request.
#' @param ServerSideEncryption The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
#' Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).
#' @param StorageClass By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
#' created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
#' high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
#' different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
#' Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage
#' Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param WebsiteRedirectLocation If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
#' object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
#' Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.
#' @param SSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param SSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
#' encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
#' discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
#' appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.
#' @param SSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param SSEKMSKeyId Specifies the AWS KMS key ID to use for object encryption. All GET and
#' PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS will fail if not made
#' via SSL or using SigV4. For information about configuring using any of
#' the officially supported AWS SDKs and AWS CLI, see [Specifying the
#' Signature Version in Request
#' Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version)
#' in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*.
#' @param SSEKMSEncryptionContext Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption.
#' The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
#' with the encryption context key-value pairs.
#' @param BucketKeyEnabled Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
#' encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting
#' this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for
#' object encryption with SSE-KMS.
#' 
#' Specifying this header with a COPY operation doesn’t affect bucket-level
#' settings for S3 Bucket Key.
#' @param CopySourceSSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param CopySourceSSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to
#' decrypt the source object. The encryption key provided in this header
#' must be one that was used when the source object was created.
#' @param CopySourceSSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param RequestPayer 
#' @param Tagging The tag-set for the object destination object this value must be used in
#' conjunction with the `TaggingDirective`. The tag-set must be encoded as
#' URL Query parameters.
#' @param ObjectLockMode The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the copied object.
#' @param ObjectLockRetainUntilDate The date and time when you want the copied object's Object Lock to
#' expire.
#' @param ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus Specifies whether you want to apply a Legal Hold to the copied object.
#' @param ExpectedBucketOwner The account id of the expected destination bucket owner. If the
#' destination bucket is owned by a different account, the request will
#' fail with an HTTP `403 (Access Denied)` error.
#' @param ExpectedSourceBucketOwner The account id of the expected source bucket owner. If the source bucket
#' is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
#' `403 (Access Denied)` error.

#' Creates a new S3 bucket
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with
#' Amazon S3 and have a valid AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests.
#' Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the
#' bucket, you become the bucket owner.
#' 
#' Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about
#' bucket naming restrictions, see [Working with Amazon S3
#' buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html).
#' 
#' If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see [Create
#' Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html).
#' 
#' By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.
#' You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might
#' choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address
#' regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will
#' probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland)
#' Region. For more information, see [Accessing a
#' bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro).
#' 
#' If you send your create bucket request to the `s3.amazonaws.com`
#' endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the
#' signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the
#' Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another
#' Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a
#' Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able
#' to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of
#' buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html).
#' 
#' When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify
#' the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on
#' the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions
#' using the request headers.
#' 
#' -   Specify a canned ACL using the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3
#'     supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each
#'     canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For
#'     more information, see [Canned
#'     ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).
#' 
#' -   Specify access permissions explicitly using the `x-amz-grant-read`,
#'     `x-amz-grant-write`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`,
#'     `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers.
#'     These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an
#'     ACL. For more information, see [Access control list (ACL)
#'     overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html).
#' 
#'     You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one
#'     of the following:
#' 
#'     -   `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS
#'         account
#' 
#'     -   `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
#' 
#'     -   `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of
#'         an AWS account
#' 
#'         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in
#'         the following AWS Regions:
#' 
#'         -   US East (N. Virginia)
#' 
#'         -   US West (N. California)
#' 
#'         -   US West (Oregon)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Singapore)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Sydney)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
#' 
#'         -   Europe (Ireland)
#' 
#'         -   South America (São Paulo)
#' 
#'         For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
#'         see [Regions and
#'         Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
#'         in the AWS General Reference.
#' 
#'     For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants the AWS
#'     accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data
#'     and its metadata:
#' 
#'     `x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" `
#' 
#' You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
#' explicitly. You cannot do both.
#'

#' [`create_bucket`][s3_create_bucket]:

#' This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID
#'
#' @description
#' This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID.
#' This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific
#' multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent
#' upload part requests (see [`upload_part`][s3_upload_part]). You also
#' include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort
#' the multipart upload request.
#' 
#' For more information about multipart uploads, see [Multipart Upload
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html).
#' 
#' If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart
#' uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in
#' the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart
#' upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and Amazon S3 aborts the
#' multipart upload. For more information, see [Aborting Incomplete
#' Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle
#' Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config).
#' 
#' For information about the permissions required to use the multipart
#' upload API, see [Multipart Upload API and
#' Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html).
#' 
#' For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular
#' requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to
#' upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign
#' each request individually. There is nothing special about signing
#' multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see
#' [Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version
#' 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html).
#' 
#' After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to
#' stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either
#' complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space
#' used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only
#' after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.
#' 
#' You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side
#' encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
#' data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your
#' own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer
#' master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose
#' to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in
#' [`upload_part`][s3_upload_part] and
#' [`upload_part_copy`][s3_upload_part_copy] requests must match the
#' headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using
#' [`create_multipart_upload`][s3_create_multipart_upload].
#' 
#' To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the
#' requester must have permission to the `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:Decrypt`,
#' `kms:ReEncrypt*`, `kms:GenerateDataKey*`, and `kms:DescribeKey` actions
#' on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must
#' decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes
#' the multipart upload.
#' 
#' If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the
#' same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these
#' permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a
#' different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on
#' both the key policy and your IAM user or role.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side
#' Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html).
#' 
#' ### Access Permissions
#' 
#' When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or
#' groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object.
#' There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:
#' 
#' -   Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. For more
#'     information, see [Canned
#'     ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).
#' 
#' -   Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
#'     `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and
#'     `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. These parameters map to the set
#'     of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more
#'     information, see [Access Control List (ACL)
#'     Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html).
#' 
#' You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
#' explicitly. You cannot do both.
#' 
#' ### Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers
#' 
#' You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using
#' server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
#' rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data
#' centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends
#' on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your
#' own encryption key.
#' 
#' -   Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys
#'     (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want
#'     AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following
#'     headers in the request.
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-server-side-encryption
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-context
#' 
#'     If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but don't
#'     provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3
#'     uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.
#' 
#'     All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if
#'     you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.
#' 
#'     For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored
#'     in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side
#'     Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
#'     KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html).
#' 
#' -   Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your
#'     own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the
#'     request.
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
#' 
#'     For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored
#'     in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side
#'     Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
#'     KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html).
#' 
#' ### Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers
#' 
#' You also can use the following access control–related headers with this
#' operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full
#' access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to
#' individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3.
#' These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the
#' object. For more information, see [Using
#' ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl_overview.html).
#' With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the
#' following two methods:
#' 
#' -   Specify a canned ACL (`x-amz-acl`) — Amazon S3 supports a set of
#'     predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each canned ACL has a
#'     predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information,
#'     see [Canned
#'     ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).
#' 
#' -   Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access
#'     permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following
#'     headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3
#'     supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control List
#'     (ACL)
#'     Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html).
#'     In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific
#'     permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-grant-read
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-grant-write
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-grant-read-acp
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-grant-write-acp
#' 
#'     -   x-amz-grant-full-control
#' 
#'     You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one
#'     of the following:
#' 
#'     -   `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS
#'         account
#' 
#'     -   `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
#' 
#'     -   `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of
#'         an AWS account
#' 
#'         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in
#'         the following AWS Regions:
#' 
#'         -   US East (N. Virginia)
#' 
#'         -   US West (N. California)
#' 
#'         -   US West (Oregon)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Singapore)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Sydney)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
#' 
#'         -   Europe (Ireland)
#' 
#'         -   South America (São Paulo)
#' 
#'         For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
#'         see [Regions and
#'         Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
#'         in the AWS General Reference.
#' 
#'     For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants the AWS
#'     accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data
#'     and its metadata:
#' 
#'     `x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" `

#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param Bucket &#91;required&#93; The name of the bucket to which to initiate the upload
#' 
#' When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
#' the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
#' *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
#' When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you

#' Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param CacheControl Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
#' @param ContentDisposition Specifies presentational information for the object.
#' @param ContentEncoding Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
#' thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
#' referenced by the Content-Type header field.
#' @param ContentLanguage The language the content is in.
#' @param ContentType A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.
#' @param Expires The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.
#' @param GrantFullControl Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the
#' object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantRead Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantReadACP Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantWriteACP Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param Key &#91;required&#93; Object key for which the multipart upload is to be initiated.
#' @param Metadata A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
#' @param ServerSideEncryption The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
#' Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).
#' @param StorageClass By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
#' created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
#' high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
#' different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
#' Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage
#' Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param WebsiteRedirectLocation If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
#' object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
#' Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.
#' @param SSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param SSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
#' encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
#' discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
#' appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.
#' @param SSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param SSEKMSKeyId Specifies the ID of the symmetric customer managed AWS KMS CMK to use
#' for object encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an object protected
#' by AWS KMS will fail if not made via SSL or using SigV4. For information
#' about configuring using any of the officially supported AWS SDKs and AWS
#' CLI, see Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication in
#' the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*.
#' @param SSEKMSEncryptionContext Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption.
#' The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
#' with the encryption context key-value pairs.
#' @param BucketKeyEnabled Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
#' encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting
#' this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for
#' object encryption with SSE-KMS.
#' 
#' Specifying this header with an object operation doesn’t affect
#' bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.
#' @param RequestPayer 
#' @param Tagging The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
#' parameters.
#' @param ObjectLockMode Specifies the Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the uploaded
#' object.
#' @param ObjectLockRetainUntilDate Specifies the date and time when you want the Object Lock to expire.
#' @param ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus Specifies whether you want to apply a Legal Hold to the uploaded object.
#' @param ExpectedBucketOwner The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
#' different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
#' `403 (Access Denied)` error.

#' Deletes the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified
#' bucket.
#' 
#' The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage
#' costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage
#' access tier, without additional operational overhead. S3
#' Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings by moving data
#' between access tiers, when access patterns change.
#' 
#' The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is suitable for objects larger
#' than 128 KB that you plan to store for at least 30 days. If the size of
#' an object is less than 128 KB, it is not eligible for auto-tiering.
#' Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the
#' frequent access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
#' 
#' If you delete an object before the end of the 30-day minimum storage
#' duration period, you are charged for 30 days. For more information, see
#' [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently
#' accessed
#' objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

#' This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket
#' using a single HTTP request
#'
#' @description
#' This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket
#' using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want
#' to delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to
#' sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.
#' 
#' The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete.
#' In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version
#' IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a
#' versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete
#' operation and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in
#' the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not
#' found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.
#' 
#' The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By
#' default, the operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes
#' the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the
#' response includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an
#' error. For a successful deletion, the operation does not return any
#' information about the delete in the response body.
#' 
#' When performing this operation on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that
#' attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token.
#' If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there
#' are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an
#' invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not,
#' the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about
#' MFA Delete, see [MFA
#' Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete).
#' 
#' Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete
#' requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request
#' body has not been altered in transit.

#' Gets the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket

#' @description
#' Gets the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.
#' 
#' The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage
#' costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage
#' access tier, without additional operational overhead. S3
#' Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings by moving data
#' between access tiers, when access patterns change.
#' 
#' The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is suitable for objects larger
#' than 128 KB that you plan to store for at least 30 days. If the size of
#' an object is less than 128 KB, it is not eligible for auto-tiering.
#' Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the
#' frequent access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
#' 
#' If you delete an object before the end of the 30-day minimum storage
#' duration period, you are charged for 30 days. For more information, see
#' [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently
#' accessed
#' objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

#' @description
#' Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule
#' using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a
#' combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API.
#' The response describes the new filter element that you can use to
#' specify a filter to select a subset of objects to which the rule
#' applies. If you are using a previous version of the lifecycle
#' configuration, it still works. For the earlier API description, see
#' [`get_bucket_lifecycle`][s3_get_bucket_lifecycle].
#' 
#' Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket. For
#' information about lifecycle configuration, see [Object Lifecycle
#' Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html).
#' 
#' To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
#' `s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this

#' Retrieves objects from Amazon S3
#'
#' @description
#' Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use `GET`, you must have `READ`
#' access to the object. If you grant `READ` access to the anonymous user,
#' you can return the object without using an authorization header.
#' 
#' An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in
#' a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical
#' hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For
#' example, instead of naming an object `sample.jpg`, you can name it
#' `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`.
#' 
#' To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key
#' name for the object in the `GET` operation. For a virtual hosted-style
#' request example, if you have the object
#' `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`, specify the resource as
#' `/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For a path-style request example, if
#' you have the object `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg` in the bucket
#' named `examplebucket`, specify the resource as
#' `/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For more information
#' about request types, see [HTTP Host Header Bucket
#' Specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket).
#' 
#' To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs
#' by using BitTorrent. For more information, see [Amazon S3
#' Torrent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3Torrent.html).
#' For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see
#' [`get_object_acl`][s3_get_object_acl].
#' 
#' If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3
#' Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or
#' S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the
#' object you must first restore a copy using
#' [`restore_object`][s3_restore_object]. Otherwise, this operation returns
#' an `InvalidObjectStateError` error. For information about restoring
#' archived objects, see [Restoring Archived
#' Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/restoring-objects.html).
#' 
#' Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should
#' not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption
#' with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with
#' Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use
#' these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.
#' 
#' If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with
#' customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in
#' Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following
#' headers:
#' 
#' -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
#' 
#' -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
#' 
#' -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
#' 
#' For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using
#' Customer-Provided Encryption
#' Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html).
#' 
#' Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the
#' `s3:GetObjectVersionTagging` action), the response also returns the
#' `x-amz-tagging-count` header that provides the count of number of tags
#' associated with the object. You can use
#' [`get_object_tagging`][s3_get_object_tagging] to retrieve the tag set
#' associated with an object.
#' 
#' **Permissions**
#' 
#' You need the `s3:GetObject` permission for this operation. For more
#' information, see [Specifying Permissions in a
#' Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html).
#' If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns
#' depends on whether you also have the `s3:ListBucket` permission.
#' 
#' -   If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3
#'     will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.
#' 
#' -   If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 will
#'     return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.
#' 
#' **Versioning**
#' 
#' By default, the GET operation returns the current version of an object.
#' To return a different version, use the `versionId` subresource.
#' 
#' If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3
#' behaves as if the object was deleted and includes
#' `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.
#' 
#' For more information about versioning, see
#' [`put_bucket_versioning`][s3_put_bucket_versioning].
#' 
#' **Overriding Response Header Values**
#' 
#' There are times when you want to override certain response header values
#' in a GET response. For example, you might override the
#' Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request.
#' 
#' You can override values for a set of response headers using the
#' following query parameters. These response header values are sent only
#' on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned.
#' The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset
#' of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The
#' response headers that you can override for the GET response are
#' `Content-Type`, `Content-Language`, `Expires`, `Cache-Control`,
#' `Content-Disposition`, and `Content-Encoding`. To override these header
#' values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.
#' 
#' You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a
#' presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an
#' unsigned (anonymous) request.
#' 
#' -   `response-content-type`
#' 
#' -   `response-content-language`
#' 
#' -   `response-expires`
#' 
#' -   `response-cache-control`
#' 
#' -   `response-content-disposition`
#' 
#' -   `response-content-encoding`
#' 
#' **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**
#' 
#' If both of the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are present
#' in the request as follows: `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`,
#' and; `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`; then, S3
#' returns 200 OK and the data requested.
#' 
#' If both of the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are
#' present in the request as follows:` If-None-Match` condition evaluates
#' to `false`, and; `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`;
#' then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.
#' 
#' For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC
#' 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).

#' The HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning
#' the object itself
#'
#' @description
#' The HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning
#' the object itself. This operation is useful if you're only interested in
#' an object's metadata. To use HEAD, you must have READ access to the
#' object.
#' 
#' A `HEAD` request has the same options as a `GET` operation on an object.
#' The response is identical to the `GET` response except that there is no
#' response body.
#' 
#' If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with
#' customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in
#' Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must
#' use the following headers:
#' 
#' -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
#' 
#' -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
#' 
#' -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
#' 
#' For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using
#' Customer-Provided Encryption
#' Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html).
#' 
#' Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should
#' not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption
#' with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with
#' Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use
#' these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.
#' 
#' Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see
#' [Common Request
#' Headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html).
#' 
#' Consider the following when using request headers:
#' 
#' -   Consideration 1 – If both of the `If-Match` and
#'     `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are present in the request as follows:
#' 
#'     -   `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;
#' 
#'     -   `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`;
#' 
#'     Then Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and the data requested.
#' 
#' -   Consideration 2 – If both of the `If-None-Match` and
#'     `If-Modified-Since` headers are present in the request as follows:
#' 
#'     -   `If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;
#' 
#'     -   `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`;
#' 
#'     Then Amazon S3 returns the `304 Not Modified` response code.
#' 
#' For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC
#' 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).
#' 
#' **Permissions**
#'

#' 
#' This operation supports list pagination and does not return more than

#' @description
#' Lists the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified
#' bucket.
#' 
#' The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage
#' costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage
#' access tier, without additional operational overhead. S3
#' Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings by moving data
#' between access tiers, when access patterns change.
#' 
#' The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is suitable for objects larger
#' than 128 KB that you plan to store for at least 30 days. If the size of
#' an object is less than 128 KB, it is not eligible for auto-tiering.
#' Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the
#' frequent access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
#' 
#' If you delete an object before the end of the 30-day minimum storage
#' duration period, you are charged for 30 days. For more information, see
#' [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently
#' accessed
#' objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

#' This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads
#'
#' @description
#' This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress
#' multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated using the
#' Initiate Multipart Upload request, but has not yet been completed or
#' aborted.
#' 
#' This operation returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the response.
#' 1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can
#' include, which is also the default value. You can further limit the
#' number of uploads in a response by specifying the `max-uploads`
#' parameter in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the
#' list criteria, the response will contain an `IsTruncated` element with
#' the value true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the
#' `key-marker` and `upload-id-marker` request parameters.
#' 
#' In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has
#' initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then
#' uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads
#' are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation
#' time.
#' 
#' For more information on multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using
#' Multipart
#' Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html).

#' @param Delimiter Character you use to group keys.
#' 
#' All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified,
#' and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are grouped
#' under a single result element, `CommonPrefixes`. If you don't specify
#' the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the beginning of the
#' key. The keys that are grouped under `CommonPrefixes` result element are
#' not returned elsewhere in the response.
#' @param EncodingType 
#' @param KeyMarker Together with upload-id-marker, this parameter specifies the multipart
#' upload after which listing should begin.
#' 
#' If `upload-id-marker` is not specified, only the keys lexicographically
#' greater than the specified `key-marker` will be included in the list.
#' 
#' If `upload-id-marker` is specified, any multipart uploads for a key
#' equal to the `key-marker` might also be included, provided those
#' multipart uploads have upload IDs lexicographically greater than the
#' specified `upload-id-marker`.
#' @param MaxUploads Sets the maximum number of multipart uploads, from 1 to 1,000, to return
#' in the response body. 1,000 is the maximum number of uploads that can be
#' returned in a response.
#' @param Prefix Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the
#' specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into
#' different grouping of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
#' groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)
#' @param UploadIdMarker Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which
#' listing should begin. If key-marker is not specified, the
#' upload-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise, any multipart uploads
#' for a key equal to the key-marker might be included in the list only if
#' they have an upload ID lexicographically greater than the specified
#' `upload-id-marker`.

#' @description
#' Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket. You can
#' use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of
#' the objects in a bucket. A `200 OK` response can contain valid or
#' invalid XML. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents
#' of the response and handle it appropriately.
#' 
#' To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.
#' 
#' To use this operation in an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
#' policy, you must have permissions to perform the `s3:ListBucket` action.
#' The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this
#' permission to others. For more information about permissions, see
#' [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource
#' Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources)

#' 
#' To get a list of your buckets, see [`list_buckets`][s3_list_buckets].

#' When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
#' the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
#' *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
#' When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you
#' provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
#' information about access point ARNs, see [Using Access
#' Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
#' to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
#' form
#' *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
#' When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you

#' @param Delimiter A delimiter is a character you use to group keys.
#' @param EncodingType Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object keys in the response.
#' @param MaxKeys Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default the
#' API returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys
#' but will never contain more.
#' @param Prefix Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.
#' @param ContinuationToken ContinuationToken indicates Amazon S3 that the list is being continued
#' on this bucket with a token. ContinuationToken is obfuscated and is not
#' a real key.
#' @param FetchOwner The owner field is not present in listV2 by default, if you want to
#' return owner field with each key in the result then set the fetch owner
#' field to true.
#' @param StartAfter StartAfter is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon S3
#' starts listing after this specified key. StartAfter can be any key in
#' the bucket.
#' @param RequestPayer Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the
#' list objects request in V2 style. Bucket owners need not specify this
#' parameter in their requests.
#' @param ExpectedBucketOwner The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a

#' Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload.
#' This operation must include the upload ID, which you obtain by sending
#' the initiate multipart upload request (see
#' [`create_multipart_upload`][s3_create_multipart_upload]). This request
#' returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The default number of parts
#' returned is 1,000 parts. You can restrict the number of parts returned
#' by specifying the `max-parts` request parameter. If your multipart
#' upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an
#' `IsTruncated` field with the value of true, and a `NextPartNumberMarker`
#' element. In subsequent [`list_parts`][s3_list_parts] requests you can
#' include the part-number-marker query string parameter and set its value
#' to the `NextPartNumberMarker` field value from the previous response.

#' Sets the accelerate configuration of an existing bucket
#'
#' @description
#' Sets the accelerate configuration of an existing bucket. Amazon S3
#' Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to
#' perform faster data transfers to Amazon S3.
#' 
#' To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
#' s3:PutAccelerateConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this
#' permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to
#' others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related
#' to Bucket Subresource
#' Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources)
#' and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
#' Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).
#' 
#' The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to one of the
#' following two values:
#' 
#' -   Enabled – Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.
#' 
#' -   Suspended – Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.
#' 
#' The
#' [`get_bucket_accelerate_configuration`][s3_get_bucket_accelerate_configuration]
#' operation returns the transfer acceleration state of a bucket.
#' 
#' After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket to Enabled, it
#' might take up to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to the
#' bucket increase.
#' 
#' The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be
#' DNS-compliant and must not contain periods (".").

#' Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists
#' (ACL)
#'
#' @description
#' Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists
#' (ACL). For more information, see [Using
#' ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl_overview.html).
#' To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have `WRITE_ACP` permission.
#' 
#' You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:
#' 
#' -   Specify the ACL in the request body
#' 
#' -   Specify permissions using request headers
#' 
#' You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request
#' headers.
#' 
#' Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a
#' bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you
#' have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request
#' body, then you can continue to use that approach.
#' 
#' **Access Permissions**
#' 
#' You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:
#' 
#' -   Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3
#'     supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each
#'     canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify
#'     the canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-acl`. If you use this
#'     header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your
#'     request. For more information, see [Canned
#'     ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).
#' 
#' -   Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
#'     `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and
#'     `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using these headers, you
#'     specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or
#'     Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these
#'     ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the `x-amz-acl` header to set a
#'     canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that
#'     Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access
#'     Control List (ACL)
#'     Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html).
#' 
#'     You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one
#'     of the following:
#' 
#'     -   `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS
#'         account
#' 
#'     -   `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
#' 
#'     -   `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of
#'         an AWS account
#' 
#'         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in
#'         the following AWS Regions:
#' 
#'         -   US East (N. Virginia)
#' 
#'         -   US West (N. California)
#' 
#'         -   US West (Oregon)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Singapore)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Sydney)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
#' 
#'         -   Europe (Ireland)
#' 
#'         -   South America (São Paulo)
#' 
#'         For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
#'         see [Regions and
#'         Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
#'         in the AWS General Reference.
#' 
#'     For example, the following `x-amz-grant-write` header grants create,
#'     overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group
#'     predefined by Amazon S3 and two AWS accounts identified by their
#'     email addresses.
#' 
#'     `x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery", id="111122223333", id="555566667777" `
#' 
#' You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
#' explicitly. You cannot do both.
#' 
#' **Grantee Values**
#' 
#' You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access
#' rights (using request elements) in the following ways:
#' 
#' -   By the person's ID:
#' 
#'     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>`
#' 
#'     DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request
#' 
#' -   By URI:
#' 
#'     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`
#' 
#' -   By Email address:
#' 
#'     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>`
#' 
#'     The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a
#'     GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.
#' 
#'     Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the
#'     following AWS Regions:
#' 
#'     -   US East (N. Virginia)
#' 
#'     -   US West (N. California)
#' 
#'     -   US West (Oregon)
#' 
#'     -   Asia Pacific (Singapore)
#' 
#'     -   Asia Pacific (Sydney)
#' 
#'     -   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
#' 
#'     -   Europe (Ireland)
#' 
#'     -   South America (São Paulo)
#'

#' Sets an analytics configuration for the bucket (specified by the

#'
#' @description
#' Sets an analytics configuration for the bucket (specified by the
#' analytics configuration ID). You can have up to 1,000 analytics
#' configurations per bucket.
#' 
#' You can choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports
#' sent to a comma-separated values (CSV) flat file. See the `DataExport`
#' request element. Reports are updated daily and are based on the object
#' filters that you configure. When selecting data export, you specify a
#' destination bucket and an optional destination prefix where the file is
#' written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different
#' account. However, the destination bucket must be in the same Region as
#' the bucket that you are making the PUT analytics configuration to. For
#' more information, see [Amazon S3 Analytics – Storage Class
#' Analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/analytics-storage-class.html).
#' 
#' You must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket where the
#' exported file is written to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write
#' objects to the bucket. For an example policy, see [Granting Permissions
#' for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class
#' Analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9).
#' 
#' To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
#' `s3:PutAnalyticsConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this
#' permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to
#' others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related

#' Sets the cors configuration for your bucket
#'
#' @description
#' Sets the `cors` configuration for your bucket. If the configuration
#' exists, Amazon S3 replaces it.
#' 
#' To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the
#' `s3:PutBucketCORS` action. By default, the bucket owner has this
#' permission and can grant it to others.
#' 
#' You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service
#' cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request
#' whose origin is `http://www.example.com` to access your Amazon S3 bucket
#' at `my.example.bucket.com` by using the browser's `XMLHttpRequest`
#' capability.
#' 
#' To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the
#' `cors` subresource to the bucket. The `cors` subresource is an XML
#' document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP
#' methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to
#' 64 KB in size.
#' 
#' When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS
#' request) against a bucket, it evaluates the `cors` configuration on the
#' bucket and uses the first `CORSRule` rule that matches the incoming
#' browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match,
#' the following conditions must be met:
#' 
#' -   The request's `Origin` header must match `AllowedOrigin` elements.
#' 
#' -   The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the
#'     `Access-Control-Request-Method` header in case of a pre-flight
#'     `OPTIONS` request must be one of the `AllowedMethod` elements.
#' 
#' -   Every header specified in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers`
#'     request header of a pre-flight request must match an `AllowedHeader`
#'     element.
#'

#' Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html)

#' Puts a S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration to the specified bucket.
#' 
#' The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage
#' costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage
#' access tier, without additional operational overhead. S3
#' Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings by moving data
#' between access tiers, when access patterns change.
#' 
#' The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is suitable for objects larger
#' than 128 KB that you plan to store for at least 30 days. If the size of
#' an object is less than 128 KB, it is not eligible for auto-tiering.
#' Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the
#' frequent access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
#' 
#' If you delete an object before the end of the 30-day minimum storage
#' duration period, you are charged for 30 days. For more information, see
#' [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently

#' This implementation of the PUT operation adds an inventory configuration
#' (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket
#'
#' @description
#' This implementation of the `PUT` operation adds an inventory
#' configuration (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket. You can
#' have up to 1,000 inventory configurations per bucket.
#' 
#' Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket
#' on a daily or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat
#' file. The bucket that is inventoried is called the *source* bucket, and
#' the bucket where the inventory flat file is stored is called the
#' *destination* bucket. The *destination* bucket must be in the same AWS
#' Region as the *source* bucket.
#' 
#' When you configure an inventory for a *source* bucket, you specify the
#' *destination* bucket where you want the inventory to be stored, and
#' whether to generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also
#' configure what object metadata to include and whether to inventory all
#' object versions or only current versions. For more information, see
#' [Amazon S3
#' Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-inventory.html)
#' in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
#' 
#' You must create a bucket policy on the *destination* bucket to grant
#' permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket in the defined
#' location. For an example policy, see [Granting Permissions for Amazon S3
#' Inventory and Storage Class
#' Analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9).
#' 
#' To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
#' `s3:PutInventoryConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this
#' permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more
#' information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket
#' Subresource
#' Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources)

#' @description
#' Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an
#' existing lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle
#' configuration, see [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
#' Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).
#' 
#' Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule
#' using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a
#' combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API.
#' The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an
#' object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility.
#' For the related API description, see
#' [`put_bucket_lifecycle`][s3_put_bucket_lifecycle].
#' 
#' **Rules**
#' 
#' You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The
#' lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more
#' rules. Each rule consists of the following:
#' 
#' -   Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies.
#'     The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a
#'     combination of both.
#' 
#' -   Status whether the rule is in effect.
#' 
#' -   One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you
#'     want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter.
#'     If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled or
#'     versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object
#'     (one current version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon
#'     S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for current and
#'     noncurrent object versions.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Object Lifecycle
#' Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html)
#' and [Lifecycle Configuration
#' Elements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intro-lifecycle-rules.html).
#' 
#' **Permissions**
#' 
#' By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets,
#' objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration
#' and website configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the AWS
#' account that created it) can access the resource. The resource owner can
#' optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access
#' policy. For this operation, a user must get the
#' s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration permission.
#' 
#' You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes
#' any other permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from
#' removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them
#' permissions for the following actions:

#' @description
#' Set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for
#' who can view and modify the logging parameters. All logs are saved to
#' buckets in the same AWS Region as the source bucket. To set the logging
#' status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.
#' 
#' The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You
#' use the `Grantee` request element to grant access to other people. The
#' `Permissions` request element specifies the kind of access the grantee
#' has to the logs.
#' 
#' **Grantee Values**
#' 
#' You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access
#' rights (using request elements) in the following ways:
#' 
#' -   By the person's ID:
#' 
#'     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>`
#' 
#'     DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.
#' 
#' -   By Email address:
#' 
#'     ` <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@@email.com<></EmailAddress></Grantee>`
#' 
#'     The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a
#'     GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.
#' 
#' -   By URI:
#'

#' Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket
#'
#' @description
#' Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more
#' information about event notifications, see [Configuring Event
#' Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html).
#' 
#' Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration.
#' The configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you
#' want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3
#' to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the
#' specified type.
#' 
#' By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is,
#' the notification configuration will be an empty
#' `NotificationConfiguration`.
#' 
#' `<NotificationConfiguration>`
#' 
#' `</NotificationConfiguration>`
#' 
#' This operation replaces the existing notification configuration with the
#' configuration you include in the request body.
#' 
#' After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon
#' Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service
#' (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has
#' permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the case
#' of AWS Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function
#' permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the
#' Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Configuring Notifications
#' for Amazon S3
#' Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html).
#' 
#' You can disable notifications by adding the empty
#' NotificationConfiguration element.
#' 
#' By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a
#' bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant
#' permission to other users to set this configuration with
#' `s3:PutBucketNotification` permission.
#' 
#' The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your
#' notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda
#' function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this
#' configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the
#' message fails, the entire PUT operation will fail, and Amazon S3 will
#' not add the configuration to your bucket.
#' 
#' **Responses**
#' 
#' If the configuration in the request body includes only one
#' `TopicConfiguration` specifying only the
#' `s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject` event type, the response will also
#' include the `x-amz-sns-test-message-id` header containing the message ID
#' of the test notification sent to the topic.
#' 
#' The following operation is related to
#' [`put_bucket_notification_configuration`][s3_put_bucket_notification_configuration]:

#' Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket
#'
#' @description
#' Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you are
#' using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that owns
#' the bucket, the calling identity must have the
#' [`put_bucket_policy`][s3_put_bucket_policy] permissions on the specified
#' bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this
#' operation.
#' 
#' If you don't have [`put_bucket_policy`][s3_put_bucket_policy]
#' permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied` error. If you have
#' the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs
#' to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a
#' `405 Method Not Allowed` error.
#' 
#' As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a

#' Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For
#' more information, see
#' [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' To perform this operation, the user or role performing the operation
#' must have the
#' [iam:PassRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html)
#' permission.
#' 
#' Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the
#' replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination
#' bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM
#' role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and
#' other relevant information.
#' 
#' A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can
#' contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to
#' replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose
#' additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.
#' 
#' To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a
#' replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule
#' element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or
#' more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the
#' configuration, you must also add the following elements:
#' `DeleteMarkerReplication`, `Status`, and `Priority`.
#' 
#' If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration,
#' Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more
#' information, see [Backward
#' Compatibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations).
#' 
#' For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see [Using
#' Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html).
#' 
#' By default, a resource owner, in this case the AWS account that created
#' the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also
#' grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information
#' about permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a
#' Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html)
#' and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
#' Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).
#' 
#' **Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects**
#' 
#' By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest
#' using server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS. To replicate
#' AWS KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: `SourceSelectionCriteria`,
#' `SseKmsEncryptedObjects`, `Status`, `EncryptionConfiguration`, and
#' `ReplicaKmsKeyID`. For information about replication configuration, see
#' [Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using CMKs stored in AWS
#' KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html).

#' 
#' **Enabled**—Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All
#' objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.
#' 
#' **Suspended**—Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All
#' objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.
#' 
#' If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no
#' versioning state; a [`get_bucket_versioning`][s3_get_bucket_versioning]
#' request does not return a versioning state value.
#' 
#' If the bucket owner enables MFA Delete in the bucket versioning
#' configuration, the bucket owner must include the `x-amz-mfa request`
#' header and the `Status` and the `MfaDelete` request elements in a
#' request to set the versioning state of the bucket.
#' 
#' If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned
#' bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when
#' you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The
#' noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the
#' noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A
#' version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent
#' object versions.) For more information, see [Lifecycle and
#' Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config).

#' Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the website

#'
#' @description
#' Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the `website`
#' subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this
#' subresource on the bucket with website configuration information such as
#' the file name of the index document and any redirect rules. For more
#' information, see [Hosting Websites on Amazon
#' S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html).
#' 
#' This PUT operation requires the `S3:PutBucketWebsite` permission. By
#' default, only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a
#' bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website
#' configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them the
#' `S3:PutBucketWebsite` permission.
#' 
#' To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint,
#' you add a website configuration with the following elements. Because all
#' requests are sent to another website, you don't need to provide index
#' document name for the bucket.
#' 
#' -   `WebsiteConfiguration`
#' 
#' -   `RedirectAllRequestsTo`
#' 
#' -   `HostName`
#' 
#' -   `Protocol`
#' 
#' If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the following
#' elements to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting
#' requests and information about the redirect destination. In this case,
#' the website configuration must provide an index document for the bucket,
#' because some requests might not be redirected.
#' 
#' -   `WebsiteConfiguration`
#' 
#' -   `IndexDocument`
#' 
#' -   `Suffix`
#' 
#' -   `ErrorDocument`

#' Adds an object to a bucket
#'
#' @description
#' Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket
#' to add an object to it.
#' 
#' Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response,
#' Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.
#' 
#' Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write
#' requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the
#' last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you
#' need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use
#' versioning instead.
#' 
#' To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the
#' `Content-MD5` header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the
#' object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns
#' an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an
#' object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5
#' value.
#' 
#' The `Content-MD5` header is required for any request to upload an object
#' with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more
#' information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see [Amazon S3 Object Lock
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Server-side Encryption**
#' 
#' You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side
#' encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
#' data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the
#' option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed encryption
#' keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see [Using Server-Side
#' Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html).
#' 
#' If you request server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service
#' (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more
#' information, see [Amazon S3 Bucket
#' Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-key.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**
#' 
#' You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all
#' objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding
#' a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to
#' predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added
#' to the ACL on the object. For more information, see [Access Control List
#' (ACL)
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html)
#' and [Managing ACLs Using the REST
#' API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/managing-acls.html).
#' 
#' **Storage Class Options**
#' 
#' By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
#' created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
#' high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
#' different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
#' Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage
#' Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Versioning**
#' 
#' If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates
#' a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this
#' ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon
#' S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously,
#' it stores all of the objects.
#' 
#' For more information about versioning, see [Adding Objects to Versioning
#' Enabled
#' Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html).

#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
#' to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
#' form
#' *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.*outpostID*.s3-outposts.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
#' When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you

#' information, see
#' <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1>.
#' @param ContentEncoding Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
#' thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
#' referenced by the Content-Type header field. For more information, see
#' <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11>.
#' @param ContentLanguage The language the content is in.
#' @param ContentLength Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the
#' body cannot be determined automatically. For more information, see
#' <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13>.
#' @param ContentMD5 The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the message (without the
#' headers) according to RFC 1864. This header can be used as a message
#' integrity check to verify that the data is the same data that was
#' originally sent. Although it is optional, we recommend using the
#' Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For more
#' information about REST request authentication, see [REST
#' Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html).
#' @param ContentType A standard MIME type describing the format of the contents. For more
#' information, see
#' <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17>.
#' @param Expires The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable. For more
#' information, see
#' <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21>.
#' @param GrantFullControl Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the
#' object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantRead Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantReadACP Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantWriteACP Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param Key &#91;required&#93; Object key for which the PUT operation was initiated.
#' @param Metadata A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
#' @param ServerSideEncryption The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
#' Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).
#' @param StorageClass By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
#' created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
#' high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
#' different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
#' Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage
#' Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param WebsiteRedirectLocation If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
#' object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
#' Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For
#' information about object metadata, see [Object Key and
#' Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingMetadata.html).
#' 
#' In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an
#' object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:
#' 
#' `x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html`
#' 
#' In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to
#' another website:
#' 
#' `x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/`
#' 
#' For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see [Hosting
#' Websites on Amazon
#' S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html)
#' and [How to Configure Website Page
#' Redirects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-page-redirect.html).
#' @param SSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param SSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
#' encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
#' discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
#' appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.
#' @param SSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param SSEKMSKeyId If `x-amz-server-side-encryption` is present and has the value of
#' `aws:kms`, this header specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management
#' Service (AWS KMS) symmetrical customer managed customer master key (CMK)
#' that was used for the object.
#' 
#' If the value of `x-amz-server-side-encryption` is `aws:kms`, this header
#' specifies the ID of the symmetric customer managed AWS KMS CMK that will
#' be used for the object. If you specify
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but do not
#' provide` x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses
#' the AWS managed CMK in AWS to protect the data.
#' @param SSEKMSEncryptionContext Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption.
#' The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
#' with the encryption context key-value pairs.
#' @param BucketKeyEnabled Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
#' encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting
#' this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for
#' object encryption with SSE-KMS.
#' 
#' Specifying this header with a PUT operation doesn’t affect bucket-level
#' settings for S3 Bucket Key.
#' @param RequestPayer 
#' @param Tagging The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
#' parameters. (For example, "Key1=Value1")
#' @param ObjectLockMode The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.
#' @param ObjectLockRetainUntilDate The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire.
#' @param ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more
#' information about S3 Object Lock, see [Object
#' Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html).
#' @param ExpectedBucketOwner The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
#' different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
#' `403 (Access Denied)` error.

#' Uses the acl subresource to set the access control list (ACL)
#' permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket
#'
#' @description
#' Uses the `acl` subresource to set the access control list (ACL)
#' permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have
#' `WRITE_ACP` permission to set the ACL of an object. For more
#' information, see [What permissions can I
#' grant?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#permissions)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' 
#' Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an
#' object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you
#' have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request
#' body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see
#' [Access Control List (ACL)
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Access Permissions**
#' 
#' You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:
#' 
#' -   Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3
#'     supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned
#'     ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the
#'     canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-ac`l. If you use this header,
#'     you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your
#'     request. For more information, see [Canned
#'     ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).
#' 
#' -   Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
#'     `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and
#'     `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using these headers, you
#'     specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or
#'     Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these
#'     ACL-specific headers, you cannot use `x-amz-acl` header to set a
#'     canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that
#'     Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access
#'     Control List (ACL)
#'     Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html).
#' 
#'     You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one
#'     of the following:
#' 
#'     -   `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS
#'         account
#' 
#'     -   `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
#' 
#'     -   `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of
#'         an AWS account
#' 
#'         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in
#'         the following AWS Regions:
#' 
#'         -   US East (N. Virginia)
#' 
#'         -   US West (N. California)
#' 
#'         -   US West (Oregon)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Singapore)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Sydney)
#' 
#'         -   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
#' 
#'         -   Europe (Ireland)
#' 
#'         -   South America (São Paulo)
#' 
#'         For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
#'         see [Regions and
#'         Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
#'         in the AWS General Reference.
#' 
#'     For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants list
#'     objects permission to the two AWS accounts identified by their email
#'     addresses.
#' 
#'     `x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@@amazon.com" `
#' 
#' You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
#' explicitly. You cannot do both.
#' 
#' **Grantee Values**
#' 
#' You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access
#' rights (using request elements) in the following ways:
#' 
#' -   By the person's ID:
#' 
#'     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>`
#' 
#'     DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.
#' 
#' -   By URI:
#' 
#'     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`
#' 
#' -   By Email address:
#' 
#'     `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>`
#' 
#'     The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a
#'     GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.
#' 
#'     Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the
#'     following AWS Regions:
#' 
#'     -   US East (N. Virginia)
#' 
#'     -   US West (N. California)
#' 
#'     -   US West (Oregon)
#' 
#'     -   Asia Pacific (Singapore)
#' 
#'     -   Asia Pacific (Sydney)
#' 
#'     -   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
#' 
#'     -   Europe (Ireland)
#' 
#'     -   South America (São Paulo)
#' 
#'     For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see
#'     [Regions and
#'     Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
#'     in the AWS General Reference.
#' 
#' **Versioning**
#' 
#' The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT
#' sets the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of a
#' different version, use the `versionId` subresource.

#' Sets the supplied tag-set to an object that already exists in a bucket.
#' 
#' A tag is a key-value pair. You can associate tags with an object by

#' Creates or modifies the PublicAccessBlock configuration for an Amazon S3

#'
#' @description
#' Creates or modifies the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for an Amazon
#' S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the
#' `s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock` permission. For more information about
#' Amazon S3 permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a
#' Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html).
#' 
#' When Amazon S3 evaluates the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for a
#' bucket or an object, it checks the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for
#' both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket
#' owner's account. If the `PublicAccessBlock` configurations are different
#' between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive
#' combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.
#' 
#' For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an

#' Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3
#'
#' @description
#' Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' 
#' This action performs the following types of requests:
#' 
#' -   `select` - Perform a select query on an archived object
#' 
#' -   `restore an archive` - Restore an archived object
#' 
#' To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
#' `s3:RestoreObject` action. The bucket owner has this permission by
#' default and can grant this permission to others. For more information
#' about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource
#' Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources)
#' and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
#' Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Querying Archives with Select Requests**
#' 
#' You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived
#' objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select
#' request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV)
#' files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data
#' without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an
#' overview about select requests, see [Querying Archived
#' Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/querying-glacier-archives.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' When making a select request, do the following:
#' 
#' -   Define an output location for the select query's output. This must
#'     be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the bucket that
#'     contains the archive object that is being queried. The AWS account
#'     that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3
#'     bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the
#'     output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about
#'     output, see [Querying Archived
#'     Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/querying-glacier-archives.html)
#'     in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#'     For more information about the `S3` structure in the request body,
#'     see the following:
#' 
#'     -   [`put_object`][s3_put_object]
#' 
#'     -   [Managing Access with
#'         ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl_overview.html)
#'         in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*
#' 
#'     -   [Protecting Data Using Server-Side
#'         Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html)
#'         in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*
#' 
#' -   Define the SQL expression for the `SELECT` type of restoration for
#'     your query in the request body's `SelectParameters` structure. You
#'     can use expressions like the following examples.
#' 
#'     -   The following expression returns all records from the specified
#'         object.
#' 
#'         `SELECT * FROM Object`
#' 
#'     -   Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in
#'         the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.
#' 
#'         `SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100`
#' 
#'     -   If you have headers and you set the `fileHeaderInfo` in the
#'         `CSV` structure in the request body to `USE`, you can specify
#'         headers in the query. (If you set the `fileHeaderInfo` field to
#'         `IGNORE`, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot
#'         mix ordinal positions with header column names.
#' 
#'         `SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s`
#' 
#' For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see
#' [SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier
#' Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' When making a select request, you can also do the following:
#' 
#' -   To expedite your queries, specify the `Expedited` tier. For more
#'     information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this
#'     topic.
#' 
#' -   Specify details about the data serialization format of both the
#'     input object that is being queried and the serialization of the
#'     CSV-encoded query results.
#' 
#' The following are additional important facts about the select feature:
#' 
#' -   The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive
#'     retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or
#'     through a lifecycle policy.
#' 
#' -   You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3
#'     object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing
#'     duplicate requests.
#' 
#' -   Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already
#'     been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response `409`.
#' 
#' **Restoring objects**
#' 
#' Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive
#' storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3
#' Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time.
#' For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must
#' first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is
#' moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3
#' Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore
#' request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is
#' available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for
#' the duration (number of days) that you specify.
#' 
#' To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If
#' you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.
#' 
#' When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can
#' specify one of the following data access tier options in the `Tier`
#' element of the request body:
#' 
#' -   **`Expedited`** - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access
#'     your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3
#'     Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for
#'     a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived
#'     objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is
#'     typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity
#'     ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is
#'     available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned
#'     capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep
#'     Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
#' 
#' -   **`Standard`** - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your
#'     archived objects within several hours. This is the default option
#'     for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option.
#'     Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects
#'     stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
#'     Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects
#'     stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3
#'     Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free
#'     for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
#' 
#' -   **`Bulk`** - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in
#'     S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes,
#'     of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12
#'     hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3
#'     Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48
#'     hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage
#'     class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals
#'     are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
#' 
#' For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned
#' capacity for `Expedited` data access, see [Restoring Archived
#' Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/restoring-objects.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed
#' to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see
#' [Upgrading the speed of an in-progress
#' restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' To get the status of object restoration, you can send a `HEAD` request.
#' Operations return the `x-amz-restore` header, which provides information
#' about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3
#' event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or
#' completed. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon S3 Event
#' Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration
#' period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the
#' restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the
#' request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the
#' restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current
#' restore request for the object.
#' 
#' If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes
#' an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that
#' you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object
#' copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days,
#' Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about
#' lifecycle configuration, see
#' [`put_bucket_lifecycle_configuration`][s3_put_bucket_lifecycle_configuration]
#' and [Object Lifecycle
#' Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html)
#' in *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Responses**
#' 
#' A successful operation returns either the `200 OK` or `202 Accepted`
#' status code.
#' 
#' -   If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns

#' @description
#' This operation filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a
#' simple structured query language (SQL) statement. In the request, along
#' with the SQL expression, you must also specify a data serialization
#' format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object. Amazon S3 uses this
#' format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that
#' match the specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data
#' serialization format for the response.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' 
#' For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see [Selecting Content from
#' Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/selecting-content-from-objects.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' For more information about using SQL with Amazon S3 Select, see [SQL
#' Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier
#' Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Permissions**
#' 
#' You must have `s3:GetObject` permission for this operation. Amazon S3
#' Select does not support anonymous access. For more information about
#' permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a
#' Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' *Object Data Formats*
#' 
#' You can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following
#' format properties:
#' 
#' -   *CSV, JSON, and Parquet* - Objects must be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet
#'     format.
#' 
#' -   *UTF-8* - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.
#' 
#' -   *GZIP or BZIP2* - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or
#'     BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon
#'     S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports
#'     columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3
#'     Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet
#'     objects.
#' 
#' -   *Server-side encryption* - Amazon S3 Select supports querying
#'     objects that are protected with server-side encryption.
#' 
#'     For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption
#'     keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that
#'     are documented in the [`get_object`][s3_get_object]. For more
#'     information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using
#'     Customer-Provided Encryption
#'     Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html)
#'     in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#'     For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed encryption
#'     keys (SSE-S3) and customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key
#'     Management Service (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled
#'     transparently, so you don't need to specify anything. For more
#'     information about server-side encryption, including SSE-S3 and
#'     SSE-KMS, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side
#'     Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html)
#'     in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' **Working with the Response Body**
#' 
#' Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the
#' response as a series of messages and includes a `Transfer-Encoding`
#' header with `chunked` as its value in the response. For more
#' information, see [Appendix: SelectObjectContent
#' Response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTSelectObjectAppendix.html)
#' .
#' 
#' **GetObject Support**
#' 
#' The [`select_object_content`][s3_select_object_content] operation does
#' not support the following [`get_object`][s3_get_object] functionality.
#' For more information, see [`get_object`][s3_get_object].
#' 
#' -   `Range`: Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3
#'     Select request (see [SelectObjectContentRequest -
#'     ScanRange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_SelectObjectContent.html#AmazonS3-SelectObjectContent-request-ScanRange)
#'     in the request parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of
#'     an object to return.
#' 
#' -   GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE and REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes: You
#'     cannot specify the GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, or `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`
#'     storage classes. For more information, about storage classes see
#'     [Storage
#'     Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingMetadata.html#storage-class-intro)
#'     in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.

#' Uploads a part in a multipart upload
#'
#' @description
#' Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
#' 
#' In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you
#' have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data
#' source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing
#' object, you use the [`upload_part_copy`][s3_upload_part_copy] operation.
#' 
#' You must initiate a multipart upload (see
#' [`create_multipart_upload`][s3_create_multipart_upload]) before you can
#' upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns
#' an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload
#' part request.
#' 
#' Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part
#' number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within
#' the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part
#' number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part
#' is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last
#' part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.
#' 
#' To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network,
#' specify the `Content-MD5` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3
#' checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not
#' match, Amazon S3 returns an error.
#' 
#' If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3
#' uses the `x-amz-content-sha256` header as a checksum instead of
#' `Content-MD5`. For more information see [Authenticating Requests: Using
#' the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version
#' 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html).
#' 
#' **Note:** After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more
#' parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to
#' stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you
#' either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts
#' storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.
#' 
#' For more information on multipart uploads, go to [Multipart Upload
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .
#' 
#' For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload
#' API, go to [Multipart Upload API and
#' Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3
#' encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
#' decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing
#' your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption keys.
#' If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers
#' you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the
#' request to initiate the upload by using
#' [`create_multipart_upload`][s3_create_multipart_upload]. For more
#' information, go to [Using Server-Side
#' Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions.
#' Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need
#' to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request.
#' Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters
#' in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see
#' [`create_multipart_upload`][s3_create_multipart_upload].

#' Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source
#'
#' @description
#' Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source.
#' You specify the data source by adding the request header
#' `x-amz-copy-source` in your request and a byte range by adding the
#' request header `x-amz-copy-source-range` in your request.
#' 
#' The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more
#' information about multipart upload limits, go to [Quick
#' Facts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the
#' [`upload_part`][s3_upload_part] operation and provide data in your
#' request.
#' 
#' You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In
#' response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique
#' identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part
#' request.
#' 
#' For more information about using the
#' [`upload_part_copy`][s3_upload_part_copy] operation, see the following:
#' 
#' -   For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading
#'     Objects Using Multipart
#'     Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html)
#'     in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' -   For information about permissions required to use the multipart
#'     upload API, see [Multipart Upload API and
#'     Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html)
#'     in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' -   For information about copying objects using a single atomic
#'     operation vs. the multipart upload, see [Operations on
#'     Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/uploading-downloading-objects.html)
#'     in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' -   For information about using server-side encryption with
#'     customer-provided encryption keys with the UploadPartCopy operation,
#'     see [`copy_object`][s3_copy_object] and
#'     [`upload_part`][s3_upload_part].
#' 
#' Note the following additional considerations about the request headers
#' `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`, `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`,
#' `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`, and
#' `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`:
#' 
#' -   **Consideration 1** - If both of the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`
#'     and `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in
#'     the request as follows:
#' 
#'     `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;
#' 
#'     `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to
#'     `false`;
#' 
#'     Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies the data.
#' 
#' -   **Consideration 2** - If both of the
#'     `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and
#'     `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the
#'     request as follows:
#' 
#'     `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to `false`,
#'     and;
#' 
#'     `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to `true`;
#' 
#'     Amazon S3 returns `412 Precondition Failed` response code.
#' 
#' **Versioning**
#' 
#' If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions
#' of the same object. By default, `x-amz-copy-source` identifies the
#' current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a
#' delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the
#' `x-amz-copy-source`, Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object
#' does not exist. If you specify versionId in the `x-amz-copy-source` and
#' the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error,
#' because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for
#' the `x-amz-copy-source`.
#' 
#' You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to
#' copy by adding the `versionId` subresource as shown in the following
#' example:
#' 
#' `x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id`
#' 
#' **Special Errors**
#' 
#' -   -   *Code: NoSuchUpload*
#' 
#'     -   *Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The
#'         upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have
#'         been aborted or completed.*
#' 
#'     -   *HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found*
#' 
#' -   -   *Code: InvalidRequest*
#' 
#'     -   *Cause: The specified copy source is not supported as a
#'         byte-range copy source.*

#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param CopySource &#91;required&#93; Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
#' value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the
#' source object through an [access
#' point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html):
#' 
#' -   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
#'     of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a
#'     slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf`
#'     from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
#'     `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be URL
#'     encoded.
#' 
#' -   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
#'     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
#'     point, in the format
#'     `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`.
#'     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access
#'     point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
#'     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
#'     `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.
#'     The value must be URL encoded.
#' 
#'     Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the
#'     source and destination buckets are in the same AWS Region.
#' 
#'     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
#'     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
#'     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`.
#'     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
#'     outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
#'     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
#'     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.
#'     The value must be URL encoded.
#' 
#' To copy a specific version of an object, append
#' `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
#' `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).
#' If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version
#' of the source object.
#' @param CopySourceIfMatch Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.
#' @param CopySourceIfModifiedSince Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.
#' @param CopySourceIfNoneMatch Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the
#' specified ETag.
#' @param CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.
#' @param CopySourceRange The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value must
#' use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the
#' zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates that
#' you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a range
#' only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.
#' @param Key &#91;required&#93; Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.
#' @param PartNumber &#91;required&#93; Part number of part being copied. This is a positive integer between 1
#' and 10,000.
#' @param UploadId &#91;required&#93; Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being copied.
#' @param SSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param SSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
#' encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
#' discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be

#' the same encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload
#' request.
#' @param SSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
