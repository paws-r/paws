#' AWS CodeStar Connections
#' 
#' The CodeStar Connections feature is in preview release and is subject to
#' change.
#' 
#' This AWS CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and
#' usage examples of the operations and data types for the AWS CodeStar
#' Connections API. You can use the connections API to work with
#' connections and installations.
#' 
#' *Connections* are configurations that you use to connect AWS resources
#' to external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be
#' given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party
#' repository such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in
#' CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a code change is
#' made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and
#' associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection.
#' 
#' When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party
#' connection handshake. *Installations* are the apps that are used to
#' conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket
#' provider type is the Bitbucket Cloud app. When you create a connection,
#' you can choose an existing installation or create one.
#' 
#' When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such
#' as GitHub Enterprise Server, you create a *host* for your connections.
#' 
#' You can work with connections by calling:
#' 
#' -   CreateConnection, which creates a uniquely named connection that can
#'     be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.
#' 
#' -   DeleteConnection, which deletes the specified connection.
#' 
#' -   GetConnection, which returns information about the connection,
#'     including the connection status.
#' 
#' -   ListConnections, which lists the connections associated with your
#'     account.
#' 
#' You can work with hosts by calling:
#' 
#' -   CreateHost, which creates a host that represents the infrastructure
#'     where your provider is installed.
#' 
#' -   DeleteHost, which deletes the specified host.
#' 
#' -   GetHost, which returns information about the host, including the
#'     setup status.
#' 
#' -   ListHosts, which lists the hosts associated with your account.
#' 
#' You can work with tags in AWS CodeStar Connections by calling the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   ListTagsForResource, which gets information about AWS tags for a
#'     specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS CodeStar Connections.
#' 
#' -   TagResource, which adds or updates tags for a resource in AWS
#'     CodeStar Connections.
#' 
#' -   UntagResource, which removes tags for a resource in AWS CodeStar
#'     Connections.
#' 
#' For information about how to use AWS CodeStar Connections, see the
#' [Developer Tools User
#' Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/welcome-connections.html).
#'
#' @param
#' config
#' Optional configuration of credentials, endpoint, and/or region.

#'       ),
#'       profile = "string"
#'     ),
#'     endpoint = "string",
#'     region = "string"
#'   )
#' )
#' ```
