#' AWS CodeStar connections
#'
#' @description
#' This AWS CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and
#' usage examples of the operations and data types for the AWS CodeStar
#' Connections API. You can use the Connections API to work with
#' connections and installations.
#' 
#' *Connections* are configurations that you use to connect AWS resources
#' to external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be
#' given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party
#' repository such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in
#' CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a code change is
#' made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and
#' associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection.
#' 
#' When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party
#' connection handshake. *Installations* are the apps that are used to
#' conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket
#' provider type is the Bitbucket Cloud app. When you create a connection,
#' you can choose an existing installation or create one.
#' 
#' You can work with connections by calling:
#' 
#' -   CreateConnection, which creates a uniquely named connection that can
#'     be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.
#' 
#' -   DeleteConnection, which deletes the specified connection.
#' 
#' -   GetConnection, which returns information about the connection,
#'     including the connection status.
#' 
#' -   ListConnections, which lists the connections associated with your
#'     account.
#' 
#' For information about how to use AWS CodeStar Connections, see the [AWS
#' CodePipeline User
#' Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
