#' Amazon Detective
#'
#' @description
#' Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help
#' you analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web
#' Services (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based
#' events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS
#' CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It
#' also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.
#' 
#' The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of
#' behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set
#' of member accounts, and is created and managed by a master account.
#' 
#' Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API
#' to manage graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the
#' currently selected endpoint.
#' 
#' A Detective master account can use the Detective API to do the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
#'     behavior graph.
#' 
#' -   View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.
#' 
#' -   Add member accounts to a behavior graph.
#' 
#' -   Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.
#' 
#' A member account can use the Detective API to do the following:
#' 
#' -   View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.
#' 
#' -   Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
#' 
#' -   Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
#' 
#' -   Remove their account from a behavior graph.
#' 
#' All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See [Logging Detective
#' API Calls with
#' CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).
