#' Creates an EFS access point
#'
#' @description
#' Creates an EFS access point. An access point is an application-specific
#' view into an EFS file system that applies an operating system user and
#' group, and a file system path, to any file system request made through
#' the access point. The operating system user and group override any
#' identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is
#' exposed as the access point's root directory. Applications using the
#' access point can only access data in its own directory and below. To
#' learn more, see [Mounting a File System Using EFS Access
#' Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html).
#' 
#' This operation requires permissions for the
#' `elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint` action.
#'
#' @usage
#' efs_create_access_point(ClientToken, Tags, FileSystemId, PosixUser,
#'   RootDirectory)
#'
#' @param ClientToken &#91;required&#93; A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon EFS uses to ensure
#' idempotent creation.
#' @param Tags Creates tags associated with the access point. Each tag is a key-value
#' pair.
#' @param FileSystemId &#91;required&#93; The ID of the EFS file system that the access point provides access to.
#' @param PosixUser The operating system user and group applied to all file system requests
#' made using the access point.
#' @param RootDirectory Specifies the directory on the Amazon EFS file system that the access
#' point exposes as the root directory of your file system to NFS clients
#' using the access point. The clients using the access point can only
#' access the root directory and below. If the `RootDirectory` \> `Path`
#' specified does not exist, EFS creates it and applies the `CreationInfo`
#' settings when a client connects to an access point. When specifying a
#' `RootDirectory`, you need to provide the `Path`, and the `CreationInfo`
#' is optional.

#' Creates a new, empty file system
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation
#' token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation
#' (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a
#' file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's AWS
#' account with the specified creation token, this operation does the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an
#'     Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state `creating`.
#' 
#' -   Returns with the description of the created file system.
#' 
#' Otherwise, this operation returns a `FileSystemAlreadyExists` error with
#' the ID of the existing file system.
#' 
#' For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the
#' creation token.
#' 
#' The idempotent operation allows you to retry a
#' [`create_file_system`][efs_create_file_system] call without risk of
#' creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call
#' fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was
#' actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout
#' occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same
#' creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file
#' system, the client can learn of its existence from the
#' `FileSystemAlreadyExists` error.
#' 
#' The [`create_file_system`][efs_create_file_system] call returns while
#' the file system's lifecycle state is still `creating`. You can check the
#' file system creation status by calling the
#' [`describe_file_systems`][efs_describe_file_systems] operation, which
#' among other things returns the file system state.
#' 
#' This operation also takes an optional `PerformanceMode` parameter that
#' you choose for your file system. We recommend `generalPurpose`
#' performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the `maxIO`
#' performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and
#' operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for
#' most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the
#' file system has been created. For more information, see [Amazon EFS:
#' Performance
#' Modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html).
#' 
#' After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle
#' state to `available`, at which point you can create one or more mount
#' targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see
#' [`create_mount_target`][efs_create_mount_target]. You mount your Amazon
#' EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by using the mount
#' target. For more information, see [Amazon EFS: How it
#' Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html).
#' 
#' This operation requires permissions for the
#' `elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem` action.
#'
#' @usage
#' efs_create_file_system(CreationToken, PerformanceMode, Encrypted,
#'   KmsKeyId, ThroughputMode, ProvisionedThroughputInMibps, Tags)
#'
#' @param CreationToken &#91;required&#93; A string of up to 64 ASCII characters. Amazon EFS uses this to ensure
#' idempotent creation.
#' @param PerformanceMode The performance mode of the file system. We recommend `generalPurpose`
#' performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the `maxIO`
#' performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and
#' operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for
#' most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the
#' file system has been created.
#' @param Encrypted A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When
#' creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying
#' CreateFileSystemRequest$KmsKeyId for an existing AWS Key Management
#' Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). If you don't specify a CMK,
#' then the default CMK for Amazon EFS, `/aws/elasticfilesystem`, is used
#' to protect the encrypted file system.
#' @param KmsKeyId The ID of the AWS KMS CMK to be used to protect the encrypted file
#' system. This parameter is only required if you want to use a nondefault
#' CMK. If this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for Amazon EFS
#' is used. This ID can be in one of the following formats:
#' 
#' -   Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example
#'     `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
#' 
#' -   ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example
#'     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
#' 
#' -   Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example
#'     `alias/projectKey1`.
#' 
#' -   Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example
#'     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1`.
#' 
#' If `KmsKeyId` is specified, the CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted
#' parameter must be set to true.
#' 
#' EFS accepts only symmetric CMKs. You cannot use asymmetric CMKs with EFS
#' file systems.
#' @param ThroughputMode The throughput mode for the file system to be created. There are two
#' throughput modes to choose from for your file system: `bursting` and
#' `provisioned`. If you set `ThroughputMode` to `provisioned`, you must
#' also set a value for `ProvisionedThroughPutInMibps`. You can decrease
#' your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change
#' between the throughput modes as long as it’s been more than 24 hours
#' since the last decrease or throughput mode change. For more, see
#' [Specifying Throughput with Provisioned
#' Mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#provisioned-throughput)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide.*
#' @param ProvisionedThroughputInMibps The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file
#' system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if
#' `ThroughputMode` is set to `provisioned`. The upper limit for throughput
#' is 1024 MiB/s. You can get this limit increased by contacting AWS
#' Support. For more information, see [Amazon EFS Limits That You Can
#' Increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide.*
#' @param Tags A value that specifies to create one or more tags associated with the
#' file system. Each tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file
#' system on creation by including a `"Key":"Name","Value":"{value}"`
#' key-value pair.

#' Creates a mount target for a file system
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file
#' system on EC2 instances by using the mount target.
#' 
#' You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC.
#' All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a
#' single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple
#' subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the
#' subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount
#' target in order to access their file system. For more information, see
#' [Amazon EFS: How it
#' Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html).
#' 
#' In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are
#' creating the mount target and the file system's lifecycle state must be
#' `available`. For more information, see
#' [`describe_file_systems`][efs_describe_file_systems].
#' 
#' In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which determines the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
#' 
#' -   Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
#' 
#' -   IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the
#'     mount target (if you don't specify an IP address in the request)
#' 
#' After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that
#' includes, a `MountTargetId` and an `IpAddress`. You use this IP address
#' when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the
#' mount target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance
#' on which you mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve
#' the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see
#' [How it Works: Implementation
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation).
#' 
#' Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one
#' VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That
#' is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for
#' it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must
#' meet the following requirements:
#' 
#' -   Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount
#'     targets
#' 
#' -   Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of
#'     the existing mount targets
#' 
#' If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.
#' 
#' -   Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:
#' 
#'     -   If the request provides an `IpAddress`, Amazon EFS assigns that
#'         IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS
#'         assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the
#'         Amazon EC2 `CreateNetworkInterface` call does when a request
#'         does not specify a primary private IP address).
#' 
#'     -   If the request provides `SecurityGroups`, this network interface
#'         is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs
#'         to the default security group for the subnet's VPC.
#' 
#'     -   Assigns the description
#'         `Mount target fsmt-id for file system fs-id ` where ` fsmt-id `
#'         is the mount target ID, and ` fs-id ` is the `FileSystemId`.
#' 
#'     -   Sets the `requesterManaged` property of the network interface to
#'         `true`, and the `requesterId` value to `EFS`.
#' 
#'     Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed
#'     EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created,
#'     Amazon EFS sets the `NetworkInterfaceId` field in the mount target's
#'     description to the network interface ID, and the `IpAddress` field
#'     to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire
#'     [`create_mount_target`][efs_create_mount_target] operation fails.
#' 
#' The [`create_mount_target`][efs_create_mount_target] call returns only
#' after creating the network interface, but while the mount target state
#' is still `creating`, you can check the mount target creation status by
#' calling the [`describe_mount_targets`][efs_describe_mount_targets]
#' operation, which among other things returns the mount target state.
#' 
#' We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability
#' Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an
#' Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability
#' Zone. For more information, see [Amazon
#' EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/). In addition, by always using a mount
#' target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a
#' partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount
#' target is created goes down, then you can't access your file system
#' through that mount target.
#' 
#' This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file
#' system:
#' 
#' -   `elasticfilesystem:CreateMountTarget`
#' 
#' This operation also requires permissions for the following Amazon EC2
#' actions:

#' @description
#' Updates the throughput mode or the amount of provisioned throughput of
#' an existing file system.
#'
#' @usage
#' efs_update_file_system(FileSystemId, ThroughputMode,
#'   ProvisionedThroughputInMibps)
#'
#' @param FileSystemId &#91;required&#93; The ID of the file system that you want to update.
#' @param ThroughputMode (Optional) The throughput mode that you want your file system to use. If
#' you're not updating your throughput mode, you don't need to provide this
#' value in your request. If you are changing the `ThroughputMode` to
#' `provisioned`, you must also set a value for
#' `ProvisionedThroughputInMibps`.
#' @param ProvisionedThroughputInMibps (Optional) The amount of throughput, in MiB/s, that you want to
#' provision for your file system. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if
#' `ThroughputMode` is changed to `provisioned` on update. If you're not
#' updating the amount of provisioned throughput for your file system, you
#' don't need to provide this value in your request.
