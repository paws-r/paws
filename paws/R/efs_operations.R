#' Creates an EFS access point
#'
#' @description
#' Creates an EFS access point. An access point is an application-specific
#' view into an EFS file system that applies an operating system user and
#' group, and a file system path, to any file system request made through
#' the access point. The operating system user and group override any
#' identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is
#' exposed as the access point's root directory. Applications using the
#' access point can only access data in the application's own directory and
#' any subdirectories. To learn more, see [Mounting a file system using EFS
#' access
#' points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html).
#' 
#' This operation requires permissions for the
#' `elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint` action.
#'
#' @usage
#' efs_create_access_point(ClientToken, Tags, FileSystemId, PosixUser,
#'   RootDirectory)
#'
#' @param ClientToken &#91;required&#93; A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon EFS uses to ensure
#' idempotent creation.
#' @param Tags Creates tags associated with the access point. Each tag is a key-value
#' pair, each key must be unique. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon
#' Web Services
#' resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide*.
#' @param FileSystemId &#91;required&#93; The ID of the EFS file system that the access point provides access to.
#' @param PosixUser The operating system user and group applied to all file system requests
#' made using the access point.
#' @param RootDirectory Specifies the directory on the Amazon EFS file system that the access
#' point exposes as the root directory of your file system to NFS clients
#' using the access point. The clients using the access point can only
#' access the root directory and below. If the `RootDirectory` \> `Path`
#' specified does not exist, EFS creates it and applies the `CreationInfo`
#' settings when a client connects to an access point. When specifying a
#' `RootDirectory`, you must provide the `Path`, and the `CreationInfo`.
#' 
#' Amazon EFS creates a root directory only if you have provided the
#' CreationInfo: OwnUid, OwnGID, and permissions for the directory. If you
#' do not provide this information, Amazon EFS does not create the root
#' directory. If the root directory does not exist, attempts to mount using
#' the access point will fail.

#' Creates a new, empty file system
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation
#' token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation
#' (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a
#' file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's
#' Amazon Web Services account with the specified creation token, this
#' operation does the following:
#' 
#' -   Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an
#'     Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state `creating`.
#' 
#' -   Returns with the description of the created file system.
#' 
#' Otherwise, this operation returns a `FileSystemAlreadyExists` error with
#' the ID of the existing file system.
#' 
#' For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the
#' creation token.
#' 
#' The idempotent operation allows you to retry a
#' [`create_file_system`][efs_create_file_system] call without risk of
#' creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call
#' fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was
#' actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout
#' occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same
#' creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file
#' system, the client can learn of its existence from the
#' `FileSystemAlreadyExists` error.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Creating a file
#' system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/creating-using-create-fs.html#creating-using-create-fs-part1)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
#' 
#' The [`create_file_system`][efs_create_file_system] call returns while
#' the file system's lifecycle state is still `creating`. You can check the
#' file system creation status by calling the
#' [`describe_file_systems`][efs_describe_file_systems] operation, which
#' among other things returns the file system state.
#' 
#' This operation accepts an optional `PerformanceMode` parameter that you
#' choose for your file system. We recommend `generalPurpose` performance
#' mode for most file systems. File systems using the `maxIO` performance
#' mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations
#' per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file
#' operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system
#' has been created. For more information, see [Amazon EFS performance
#' modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html).
#' 
#' You can set the throughput mode for the file system using the
#' `ThroughputMode` parameter.
#' 
#' After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle
#' state to `available`, at which point you can create one or more mount
#' targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see
#' [`create_mount_target`][efs_create_mount_target]. You mount your Amazon
#' EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by using the mount
#' target. For more information, see [Amazon EFS: How it
#' Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html).
#' 
#' This operation requires permissions for the
#' `elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem` action.
#'
#' @usage
#' efs_create_file_system(CreationToken, PerformanceMode, Encrypted,
#'   KmsKeyId, ThroughputMode, ProvisionedThroughputInMibps,
#'   AvailabilityZoneName, Backup, Tags)
#'
#' @param CreationToken &#91;required&#93; A string of up to 64 ASCII characters. Amazon EFS uses this to ensure
#' idempotent creation.
#' @param PerformanceMode The performance mode of the file system. We recommend `generalPurpose`
#' performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the `maxIO`
#' performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and
#' operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for
#' most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the
#' file system has been created.
#' 
#' The `maxIO` mode is not supported on file systems using One Zone storage
#' classes.
#' @param Encrypted A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When
#' creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying an
#' existing Key Management Service key (KMS key). If you don't specify a
#' KMS key, then the default KMS key for Amazon EFS,
#' `/aws/elasticfilesystem`, is used to protect the encrypted file system.
#' @param KmsKeyId The ID of the KMS key that you want to use to protect the encrypted file
#' system. This parameter is required only if you want to use a non-default
#' KMS key. If this parameter is not specified, the default KMS key for
#' Amazon EFS is used. You can specify a KMS key ID using the following
#' formats:
#' 
#' -   Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example
#'     `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
#' 
#' -   ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example
#'     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
#' 
#' -   Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example
#'     `alias/projectKey1`.
#' 
#' -   Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example
#'     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1`.
#' 
#' If you use `KmsKeyId`, you must set the
#' CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted parameter to true.
#' 
#' EFS accepts only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot use asymmetric KMS keys
#' with Amazon EFS file systems.
#' @param ThroughputMode Specifies the throughput mode for the file system, either `bursting` or
#' `provisioned`. If you set `ThroughputMode` to `provisioned`, you must
#' also set a value for `ProvisionedThroughputInMibps`. After you create
#' the file system, you can decrease your file system's throughput in
#' Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes, as
#' long as it’s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or
#' throughput mode change. For more information, see [Specifying throughput
#' with provisioned
#' mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#provisioned-throughput)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
#' 
#' Default is `bursting`.
#' @param ProvisionedThroughputInMibps The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file
#' system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if
#' `ThroughputMode` is set to `provisioned`. The upper limit for throughput
#' is 1024 MiB/s. To increase this limit, contact Amazon Web Services
#' Support. For more information, see [Amazon EFS quotas that you can
#' increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
#' @param AvailabilityZoneName Used to create a file system that uses One Zone storage classes. It
#' specifies the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in which to create
#' the file system. Use the format `us-east-1a` to specify the Availability
#' Zone. For more information about One Zone storage classes, see [Using
#' EFS storage
#' classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/storage-classes.html)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
#' 
#' One Zone storage classes are not available in all Availability Zones in
#' Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon EFS is available.
#' @param Backup Specifies whether automatic backups are enabled on the file system that
#' you are creating. Set the value to `true` to enable automatic backups.
#' If you are creating a file system that uses One Zone storage classes,
#' automatic backups are enabled by default. For more information, see
#' [Automatic
#' backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/awsbackup.html#automatic-backups)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
#' 
#' Default is `false`. However, if you specify an `AvailabilityZoneName`,
#' the default is `true`.
#' 
#' Backup is not available in all Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon
#' EFS is available.
#' @param Tags Use to create one or more tags associated with the file system. Each tag
#' is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on creation by
#' including a `"Key":"Name","Value":"{value}"` key-value pair. Each key
#' must be unique. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services

#' Creates a mount target for a file system
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file
#' system on EC2 instances by using the mount target.
#' 
#' You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC.
#' All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a
#' single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple
#' subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the
#' subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount
#' target in order to access their file system.
#' 
#' You can create only one mount target for an EFS file system using One
#' Zone storage classes. You must create that mount target in the same
#' Availability Zone in which the file system is located. Use the
#' `AvailabilityZoneName` and `AvailabiltyZoneId` properties in the
#' [`describe_file_systems`][efs_describe_file_systems] response object to
#' get this information. Use the `subnetId` associated with the file
#' system's Availability Zone when creating the mount target.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Amazon EFS: How it
#' Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html).
#' 
#' To create a mount target for a file system, the file system's lifecycle
#' state must be `available`. For more information, see
#' [`describe_file_systems`][efs_describe_file_systems].
#' 
#' In the request, provide the following:
#' 
#' -   The file system ID for which you are creating the mount target.
#' 
#' -   A subnet ID, which determines the following:
#' 
#'     -   The VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
#' 
#'     -   The Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount
#'         target
#' 
#'     -   The IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP
#'         address of the mount target (if you don't specify an IP address
#'         in the request)
#' 
#' After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that
#' includes, a `MountTargetId` and an `IpAddress`. You use this IP address
#' when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the
#' mount target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance
#' on which you mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve
#' the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see
#' [How it Works: Implementation
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation).
#' 
#' Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one
#' VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That
#' is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for
#' it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must
#' meet the following requirements:
#' 
#' -   Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount
#'     targets
#' 
#' -   Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of
#'     the existing mount targets
#' 
#' If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.
#' 
#' -   Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:
#' 
#'     -   If the request provides an `IpAddress`, Amazon EFS assigns that
#'         IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS
#'         assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the
#'         Amazon EC2 `CreateNetworkInterface` call does when a request
#'         does not specify a primary private IP address).
#' 
#'     -   If the request provides `SecurityGroups`, this network interface
#'         is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs
#'         to the default security group for the subnet's VPC.
#' 
#'     -   Assigns the description
#'         `Mount target fsmt-id for file system fs-id ` where ` fsmt-id `
#'         is the mount target ID, and ` fs-id ` is the `FileSystemId`.
#' 
#'     -   Sets the `requesterManaged` property of the network interface to
#'         `true`, and the `requesterId` value to `EFS`.
#' 
#'     Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed
#'     EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created,
#'     Amazon EFS sets the `NetworkInterfaceId` field in the mount target's
#'     description to the network interface ID, and the `IpAddress` field
#'     to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire
#'     [`create_mount_target`][efs_create_mount_target] operation fails.
#' 
#' The [`create_mount_target`][efs_create_mount_target] call returns only
#' after creating the network interface, but while the mount target state
#' is still `creating`, you can check the mount target creation status by
#' calling the [`describe_mount_targets`][efs_describe_mount_targets]
#' operation, which among other things returns the mount target state.
#' 
#' We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability
#' Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an
#' Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability
#' Zone. For more information, see [Amazon
#' EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/). In addition, by always using a mount
#' target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a
#' partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount
#' target is created goes down, then you can't access your file system
#' through that mount target.
#' 
#' This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file
#' system:
#' 
#' -   `elasticfilesystem:CreateMountTarget`
#' 
#' This operation also requires permissions for the following Amazon EC2
#' actions:
#' 
#' -   `ec2:DescribeSubnets`
#' 
#' -   `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`
#' 
#' -   `ec2:CreateNetworkInterface`

#' Creates a replication configuration that replicates an existing EFS file
#' system to a new, read-only file system
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a replication configuration that replicates an existing EFS file
#' system to a new, read-only file system. For more information, see
#' [Amazon EFS
#' replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-replication.html)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*. The replication configuration specifies
#' the following:
#' 
#' -   **Source file system** - An existing EFS file system that you want
#'     replicated. The source file system cannot be a destination file
#'     system in an existing replication configuration.
#' 
#' -   **Destination file system configuration** - The configuration of the
#'     destination file system to which the source file system will be
#'     replicated. There can only be one destination file system in a
#'     replication configuration. The destination file system configuration
#'     consists of the following properties:
#' 
#'     -   **Amazon Web Services Region** - The Amazon Web Services Region
#'         in which the destination file system is created. Amazon EFS
#'         replication is available in all Amazon Web Services Regions that
#'         Amazon EFS is available in, except Africa (Cape Town), Asia
#'         Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Europe (Milan), and
#'         Middle East (Bahrain).
#' 
#'     -   **Availability Zone** - If you want the destination file system
#'         to use EFS One Zone availability and durability, you must
#'         specify the Availability Zone to create the file system in. For
#'         more information about EFS storage classes, see [Amazon EFS
#'         storage
#'         classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/storage-classes.html)
#'         in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
#' 
#'     -   **Encryption** - All destination file systems are created with
#'         encryption at rest enabled. You can specify the Key Management
#'         Service (KMS) key that is used to encrypt the destination file
#'         system. If you don't specify a KMS key, your service-managed KMS
#'         key for Amazon EFS is used.
#' 
#'         After the file system is created, you cannot change the KMS key.
#' 
#' The following properties are set by default:
#' 
#' -   **Performance mode** - The destination file system's performance
#'     mode matches that of the source file system, unless the destination
#'     file system uses EFS One Zone storage. In that case, the General
#'     Purpose performance mode is used. The performance mode cannot be
#'     changed.
#' 
#' -   **Throughput mode** - The destination file system uses the Bursting
#'     Throughput mode by default. After the file system is created, you
#'     can modify the throughput mode.
#' 
#' The following properties are turned off by default:
#' 
#' -   **Lifecycle management** - EFS lifecycle management and EFS
#'     Intelligent-Tiering are not enabled on the destination file system.
#'     After the destination file system is created, you can enable EFS
#'     lifecycle management and EFS Intelligent-Tiering.
#' 
#' -   **Automatic backups** - Automatic daily backups not enabled on the
#'     destination file system. After the file system is created, you can
#'     change this setting.
#'

#' replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-replication.html)

#' Deletes a file system, permanently severing access to its contents

#' @description
#' Deletes a file system, permanently severing access to its contents. Upon
#' return, the file system no longer exists and you can't access any
#' contents of the deleted file system.
#' 
#' You need to manually delete mount targets attached to a file system
#' before you can delete an EFS file system. This step is performed for you
#' when you use the Amazon Web Services console to delete a file system.
#' 
#' You cannot delete a file system that is part of an EFS Replication
#' configuration. You need to delete the replication configuration first.
#' 
#' You can't delete a file system that is in use. That is, if the file
#' system has any mount targets, you must first delete them. For more
#' information, see [`describe_mount_targets`][efs_describe_mount_targets]
#' and [`delete_mount_target`][efs_delete_mount_target].
#' 
#' The [`delete_file_system`][efs_delete_file_system] call returns while

#' deletion status by calling the
#' [`describe_file_systems`][efs_describe_file_systems] operation, which
#' returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass file system
#' ID or creation token for the deleted file system, the

#' Use this action to manage EFS lifecycle management and intelligent

#'
#' @description
#' Use this action to manage EFS lifecycle management and intelligent
#' tiering. A `LifecycleConfiguration` consists of one or more
#' `LifecyclePolicy` objects that define the following:
#' 
#' -   **EFS Lifecycle management** - When Amazon EFS automatically
#'     transitions files in a file system into the lower-cost Infrequent
#'     Access (IA) storage class.
#' 
#'     To enable EFS Lifecycle management, set the value of
#'     `TransitionToIA` to one of the available options.
#' 
#' -   **EFS Intelligent tiering** - When Amazon EFS automatically
#'     transitions files from IA back into the file system's primary
#'     storage class (Standard or One Zone Standard.
#' 
#'     To enable EFS Intelligent Tiering, set the value of
#'     `TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass` to `AFTER_1_ACCESS`.
#' 
#' For more information, see [EFS Lifecycle
#' Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/lifecycle-management-efs.html).
#' 
#' Each Amazon EFS file system supports one lifecycle configuration, which
#' applies to all files in the file system. If a `LifecycleConfiguration`
#' object already exists for the specified file system, a
#' [`put_lifecycle_configuration`][efs_put_lifecycle_configuration] call
#' modifies the existing configuration. A
#' [`put_lifecycle_configuration`][efs_put_lifecycle_configuration] call
#' with an empty `LifecyclePolicies` array in the request body deletes any
#' existing `LifecycleConfiguration` and turns off lifecycle management and
#' intelligent tiering for the file system.
#' 
#' In the request, specify the following:
#' 
#' -   The ID for the file system for which you are enabling, disabling, or
#'     modifying lifecycle management and intelligent tiering.
#' 
#' -   A `LifecyclePolicies` array of `LifecyclePolicy` objects that define
#'     when files are moved into IA storage, and when they are moved back
#'     to Standard storage.
#' 
#'     Amazon EFS requires that each `LifecyclePolicy` object have only
#'     have a single transition, so the `LifecyclePolicies` array needs to
#'     be structured with separate `LifecyclePolicy` objects. See the
#'     example requests in the following section for more information.
#' 
#' This operation requires permissions for the
#' `elasticfilesystem:PutLifecycleConfiguration` operation.
#' 
#' To apply a `LifecycleConfiguration` object to an encrypted file system,
#' you need the same Key Management Service permissions as when you created
#' the encrypted file system.

#' 
#' When using the `put-lifecycle-configuration` CLI command or the
