#' Get the state for a routing control
#'
#' @description
#' Get the state for a routing control. A routing control is a simple
#' on/off switch that you can use to route traffic to cells. When a routing
#' control state is set to ON, traffic flows to a cell. When the state is
#' set to OFF, traffic does not flow.
#' 
#' Before you can create a routing control, you must first create a
#' cluster, and then host the control in a control panel on the cluster.
#' For more information, see [Create routing control
#' structures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.create.html)
#' in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
#' You access one of the endpoints for the cluster to get or update the
#' routing control state to redirect traffic for your application.
#' 
#' *You must specify Regional endpoints when you work with API cluster
#' operations to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.*
#' 
#' To see a code example for getting a routing control state, including
#' accessing Regional cluster endpoints in sequence, see [API
#' examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/service_code_examples_actions.html)

#' List routing control names and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), as well as
#' the routing control state for each routing control, along with the

#' A routing control is a simple on/off switch in Route 53 ARC that you can

#' Set the state of the routing control to reroute traffic

#' @description
#' Set the state of the routing control to reroute traffic. You can set the
#' value to ON or OFF. When the state is ON, traffic flows to a cell. When
#' the state is OFF, traffic does not flow.
#' 
#' With Route 53 ARC, you can add safety rules for routing controls, which
#' are safeguards for routing control state updates that help prevent
#' unexpected outcomes, like fail open traffic routing. However, there are
#' scenarios when you might want to bypass the routing control safeguards
#' that are enforced with safety rules that you've configured. For example,
#' you might want to fail over quickly for disaster recovery, and one or
#' more safety rules might be unexpectedly preventing you from updating a
#' routing control state to reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario
#' like this, you can override one or more safety rules to change a routing
#' control state and fail over your application.
#' 
#' The `SafetyRulesToOverride` property enables you override one or more
#' safety rules and update routing control states. For more information,
#' see [Override safety rules to reroute
