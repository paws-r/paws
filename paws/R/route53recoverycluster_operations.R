#' Get the state for a routing control
#'
#' @description
#' Get the state for a routing control. A routing control is a simple
#' on/off switch that you can use to route traffic to cells. When a routing
#' control state is On, traffic flows to a cell. When the state is Off,
#' traffic does not flow.
#' 
#' Before you can create a routing control, you must first create a
#' cluster, and then host the control in a control panel on the cluster.
#' For more information, see Create routing control structures in the
#' Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide. You
#' access one of the endpoints for the cluster to get or update the routing
#' control state to redirect traffic for your application.
#' 
#' *You must specify Regional endpoints when you work with API cluster
#' operations to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.*
#' 
#' To see a code example for getting a routing control state, including
#' accessing Regional cluster endpoints in sequence, see API examples in
#' the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

#' 
#' With Route 53 ARC, you can add safety rules for routing controls, which
#' are safeguards for routing control state updates that help prevent
#' unexpected outcomes, like fail open traffic routing. However, there are

#' that are enforced with safety rules that you've configured. For example,
#' you might want to fail over quickly for disaster recovery, and one or
#' more safety rules might be unexpectedly preventing you from updating a
#' routing control state to reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario
#' like this, you can override one or more safety rules to change a routing
#' control state and fail over your application.
#' 
#' The `SafetyRulesToOverride` property enables you override one or more
