#' AWS Organizations API Reference
#' 
#' AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your
#' multiple AWS accounts into an *organization* and centrally manage your
#' accounts and their resources.
#' 
#' This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations API. For more
#' information about using this service, see the [AWS Organizations User
#' Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html).
#' 
#' **API Version**
#' 
#' This version of the Organizations API Reference documents the
#' Organizations API version 2016-11-28.
#' 
#' As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS
#' SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
#' languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, and more). The
#' SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS
#' Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically
#' signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically.
#' For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and
#' install them, see [Tools for Amazon Web
#' Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
#' 
#' We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to
#' Organizations. However, you also can use the Organizations Query API to
#' make direct calls to the Organizations web service. To learn more about
#' the Organizations Query API, see [Making Query
#' Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_query-requests.html)
#' in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*. Organizations supports GET and
#' POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to
#' use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are
#' subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that
#' require larger sizes, use a POST request.
#' 
#' **Signing Requests**
#' 
#' When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you must sign the requests so that
#' AWS can identify who sent them. You sign requests with your AWS access
#' key, which consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. We
#' strongly recommend that you do not create an access key for your root
#' account. Anyone who has the access key for your root account has
#' unrestricted access to all the resources in your account. Instead,
#' create an access key for an IAM user account that has administrative
#' privileges. As another option, use AWS Security Token Service to
#' generate temporary security credentials, and use those credentials to
#' sign requests.
#' 
#' To sign requests, we recommend that you use [Signature Version
#' 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
#' If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you
#' do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some
#' operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for
#' operations that require version 4 indicate this requirement.
#' 
#' When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS
#' SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the
#' requests for you with the access key that you specify when you configure
#' the tools.
#' 
#' In this release, each organization can have only one root. In a future
#' release, a single organization will support multiple roots.
#' 
#' **Support and Feedback for AWS Organizations**
#' 
#' We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to
#' <feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com> or post your feedback and
#' questions in the [AWS Organizations support
#' forum](http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219). For more
#' information about the AWS support forums, see [Forums
#' Help](http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa).
#' 
#' **Endpoint to Call When Using the CLI or the AWS API**
#' 
#' For the current release of Organizations, you must specify the
#' `us-east-1` region for all AWS API and CLI calls. You can do this in the
#' CLI by using these parameters and commands:
#' 
#' -   Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the
#'     endpoint and its region:
#' 
#'     `--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
#' 
#' -   Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with
#'     this command:
#' 
#'     `aws configure set default.region us-east-1`
#' 
#' -   Use the following parameter with each command to specify the
#'     endpoint:
#' 
#'     `--region us-east-1`
#' 
#' For the various SDKs used to call the APIs, see the documentation for
#' the SDK of interest to learn how to direct the requests to a specific
#' endpoint. For more information, see [Regions and
#' Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region)
#' in the *AWS General Reference*.
#' 
#' **How examples are presented**
#' 
#' The JSON returned by the AWS Organizations service as response to your
#' requests is returned as a single long string without line breaks or
#' formatting whitespace. Both line breaks and whitespace are included in
#' the examples in this guide to improve readability. When example input
#' parameters also would result in long strings that would extend beyond
#' the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should
#' always submit the input as a single JSON text string.
#' 
#' **Recording API Requests**
#' 
#' AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS
#' API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
#' bucket. By using information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can
#' determine which requests were successfully made to Organizations, who
#' made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS
#' Organizations and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see [Logging AWS
#' Organizations Events with AWS
#' CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration)
#' in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*. To learn more about CloudTrail,
#' including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the [AWS
#' CloudTrail User
#' Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html).
