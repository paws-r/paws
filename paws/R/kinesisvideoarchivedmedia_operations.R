#' Retrieves an MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) URL for
#' the stream
#'
#' Retrieves an MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) URL for
#' the stream. You can then open the URL in a media player to view the
#' stream contents.
#' 
#' Both the `StreamName` and the `StreamARN` parameters are optional, but
#' you must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN` when
#' invoking this API operation.
#' 
#' An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
#' providing data through MPEG-DASH:
#' 
#' -   The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and, optionally,
#'     AAC or G.711 encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1
#'     should be `V_MPEG/ISO/AVC` (for h.264) or V\\_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (for
#'     H.265). Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be `A_AAC` (for
#'     AAC) or A\\_MS/ACM (for G.711).
#' 
#' -   Data retention must be greater than 0.
#' 
#' -   The video track of each fragment must contain codec private data in
#'     the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for H.265
#'     format. For more information, see [MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC
#'     14496-15](https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html). For information
#'     about adapting stream data to a given format, see [NAL Adaptation
#'     Flags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html).
#' 
#' -   The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec
#'     private data in the AAC format ([AAC specification ISO/IEC
#'     13818-7](https://www.iso.org/standard/43345.html)) or the [MS Wave
#'     format](http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/WAVE/WAVE.html).
#' 
#' The following procedure shows how to use MPEG-DASH with Kinesis Video
#' Streams:
#' 
#' 1.  Get an endpoint using
#'     [GetDataEndpoint](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html),
#'     specifying `GET_DASH_STREAMING_SESSION_URL` for the `APIName`
#'     parameter.
#' 
#' 2.  Retrieve the MPEG-DASH URL using `GetDASHStreamingSessionURL`.
#'     Kinesis Video Streams creates an MPEG-DASH streaming session to be
#'     used for accessing content in a stream using the MPEG-DASH protocol.
#'     `GetDASHStreamingSessionURL` returns an authenticated URL (that
#'     includes an encrypted session token) for the session\'s MPEG-DASH
#'     *manifest* (the root resource needed for streaming with MPEG-DASH).
#' 
#'     Don\'t share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could
#'     access it. The token provides access to the content of the stream.
#'     Safeguard the token with the same measures that you would use with
#'     your AWS credentials.
#' 
#'     The media that is made available through the manifest consists only
#'     of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data
#'     (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates)
#'     is made available.
#' 
#' 3.  Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the
#'     MPEG-DASH manifest to a media player that supports the MPEG-DASH
#'     protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the initialization fragment
#'     and media fragments available through the manifest URL. The
#'     initialization fragment contains the codec private data for the
#'     stream, and other data needed to set up the video or audio decoder
#'     and renderer. The media fragments contain encoded video frames or
#'     encoded audio samples.
#' 
#' 4.  The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream
#'     metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests
#'     data, it calls the following actions:
#' 
#'     -   **GetDASHManifest:** Retrieves an MPEG DASH manifest, which
#'         contains the metadata for the media that you want to playback.
#' 
#'     -   **GetMP4InitFragment:** Retrieves the MP4 initialization
#'         fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization
#'         fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment
#'         contains the \"`fytp`\" and \"`moov`\" MP4 atoms, and the child
#'         atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.
#' 
#'         The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in
#'         a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data
#'         for the stream and respective track, which the media player
#'         needs to decode the media frames.
#' 
#'     -   **GetMP4MediaFragment:** Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
#'         fragments contain the \"`moof`\" and \"`mdat`\" MP4 atoms and
#'         their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment\'s media
#'         frames and their timestamps.
#' 
#'         After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming
#'         session, any fragments that don\'t contain the same codec
#'         private data cause an error to be returned when those different
#'         media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec private data
#'         should not change between fragments in a session. This also
#'         means that the session fails if the fragments in a stream change
#'         from having only video to having both audio and video.
#' 
#'         Data retrieved with this action is billable. See
#'         [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/)
#'         for details.
#' 
#' The following restrictions apply to MPEG-DASH sessions:
#' 
#' -   A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The
#'     service might throttle a session if multiple media players are
#'     sharing it. For connection limits, see [Kinesis Video Streams
#'     Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html).
#' 
#' -   A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of ten active MPEG-DASH
#'     streaming sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum
#'     number of sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created)
#'     session is closed. The number of active `GetMedia` connections on a
#'     Kinesis video stream does not count against this limit, and the
#'     number of active MPEG-DASH sessions does not count against the
#'     active `GetMedia` connection limit.
#' 
#'     The maximum limits for active HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming sessions
#'     are independent of each other.
#' 
#' You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
#' monitoring the `GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes` Amazon CloudWatch
#' metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video
#' Streams, see [Monitoring Kinesis Video
#' Streams](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/monitoring.html).
#' For pricing information, see [Amazon Kinesis Video Streams
#' Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/) and [AWS
#' Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/). Charges for both HLS sessions
#' and outgoing AWS data apply.
#' 
#' For more information about HLS, see [HTTP Live
#' Streaming](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/) on the [Apple
#' Developer site](https://developer.apple.com).
#' 
#' If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived
#' media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it
#' includes the following pieces of information:
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-ErrorType` HTTP header -- contains a more specific error type
#'     in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-RequestId` HTTP header -- if you want to report an issue to
#'     AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
#'     Request Id.
#' 
#' Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to
#' make programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and
#' under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions
#' the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully try
#' again.
#' 
#' For more information, see the **Errors** section at the bottom of this
#' topic, as well as [Common

#'
#' @usage
#' kinesisvideoarchivedmedia_get_dash_streaming_session_url(StreamName,
#'   StreamARN, PlaybackMode, DisplayFragmentTimestamp,
#'   DisplayFragmentNumber, DASHFragmentSelector, Expires,
#'   MaxManifestFragmentResults)
#'
#' @param StreamName The name of the stream for which to retrieve the MPEG-DASH manifest URL.
#' 
#' You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
#' @param StreamARN The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which to retrieve the
#' MPEG-DASH manifest URL.
#' 
#' You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
#' @param PlaybackMode Whether to retrieve live, live replay, or archived, on-demand data.
#' 
#' Features of the three types of sessions include the following:
#' 
#' -   **`LIVE`** : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest is
#'     continually updated with the latest fragments as they become
#'     available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new
#'     manifest on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
#'     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
#'     \"live\" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
#'     position in the playback window to display.
#' 
#'     In `LIVE` mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
#'     MPEG-DASH manifest, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
#'     is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
#'     player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
#'     are not added to the MPEG-DASH manifest if they are older than the
#'     newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
#'     available after a subsequent fragment is added to the manifest, the
#'     older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
#' 
#' -   **`LIVE_REPLAY`** : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH
#'     manifest is updated similarly to how it is updated for `LIVE` mode
#'     except that it starts by including fragments from a given start
#'     time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested,
#'     fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses.
#'     For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long,
#'     then a new fragment is added to the manifest every two seconds. This
#'     mode is useful to be able to start playback from when an event is
#'     detected and continue live streaming media that has not yet been
#'     ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode is also
#'     useful to stream previously archived media without being limited by
#'     the 1,000 fragment limit in the `ON_DEMAND` mode.
#' 
#' -   **`ON_DEMAND`** : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest
#'     contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is
#'     specified in `MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults`. The manifest must be
#'     retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
#'     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
#'     scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to
#'     display.
#' 
#' In all playback modes, if `FragmentSelectorType` is
#' `PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP`, and if there are multiple fragments with the same
#' start timestamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that
#' is, the newer fragment) is included in the MPEG-DASH manifest. The other
#' fragments are not included. Fragments that have different timestamps but
#' have overlapping durations are still included in the MPEG-DASH manifest.
#' This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.
#' 
#' The default is `LIVE`.
#' @param DisplayFragmentTimestamp Per the MPEG-DASH specification, the wall-clock time of fragments in the
#' manifest file can be derived using attributes in the manifest itself.
#' However, typically, MPEG-DASH compatible media players do not properly
#' handle gaps in the media timeline. Kinesis Video Streams adjusts the
#' media timeline in the manifest file to enable playback of media with
#' discontinuities. Therefore, the wall-clock time derived from the
#' manifest file may be inaccurate. If DisplayFragmentTimestamp is set to
#' `ALWAYS`, the accurate fragment timestamp is added to each S element in
#' the manifest file with the attribute name "kvs:ts". A custom MPEG-DASH
#' media player is necessary to leverage this custom attribute.
#' 
#' The default value is `NEVER`. When DASHFragmentSelector is
#' `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, the timestamps will be the server start timestamps.
#' Similarly, when DASHFragmentSelector is `PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP`, the
#' timestamps will be the producer start timestamps.
#' @param DisplayFragmentNumber Fragments are identified in the manifest file based on their sequence
#' number in the session. If DisplayFragmentNumber is set to `ALWAYS`, the
#' Kinesis Video Streams fragment number is added to each S element in the
#' manifest file with the attribute name "kvs:fn". These fragment numbers
#' can be used for logging or for use with other APIs (e.g. `GetMedia` and
#' `GetMediaForFragmentList`). A custom MPEG-DASH media player is necessary
#' to leverage these this custom attribute.
#' 
#' The default value is `NEVER`.
#' @param DASHFragmentSelector The time range of the requested fragment and the source of the
#' timestamps.
#' 
#' This parameter is required if `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND` or
#' `LIVE_REPLAY`. This parameter is optional if PlaybackMode is`` `LIVE`.
#' If `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, the `FragmentSelectorType` can be set, but
#' the `TimestampRange` should not be set. If `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`
#' or `LIVE_REPLAY`, both `FragmentSelectorType` and `TimestampRange` must
#' be set.
#' @param Expires The time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value can
#' be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).
#' 
#' When a session expires, no new calls to `GetDashManifest`,
#' `GetMP4InitFragment`, or `GetMP4MediaFragment` can be made for that
#' session.
#' 
#' The default is 300 (5 minutes).
#' @param MaxManifestFragmentResults The maximum number of fragments that are returned in the MPEG-DASH
#' manifest.
#' 
#' When the `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, the most recent fragments are
#' returned up to this value. When the `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`, the
#' oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.
#' 
#' When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live
#' MPEG-DASH manifest, video players often buffer content before starting
#' playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but
#' it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback.
#' We recommend that a live MPEG-DASH manifest have a minimum of 3
#' fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.
#' 
#' The default is 5 fragments if `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE` or `LIVE_REPLAY`,
#' and 1,000 if `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`.
#' 
#' The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16 minutes
#' of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2 1/2 hours
#' of video on streams with 10-second fragments.

#' invoking this API operation.
#' 
#' An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
#' providing data through HLS:
#' 
#' -   The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and, optionally,
#'     AAC encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1 should be
#'     `V_MPEG/ISO/AVC` (for h.264) or `V_MPEG/ISO/HEVC` (for h.265).
#'     Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be `A_AAC`.
#' 
#' -   Data retention must be greater than 0.
#' 
#' -   The video track of each fragment must contain codec private data in
#'     the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format or HEVC for H.265
#'     format ([MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC
#'     14496-15](https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html)). For information
#'     about adapting stream data to a given format, see [NAL Adaptation
#'     Flags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html).
#' 
#' -   The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec
#'     private data in the AAC format ([AAC specification ISO/IEC
#'     13818-7](https://www.iso.org/standard/43345.html)).
#' 
#' Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the fragmented
#' MPEG-4 form (also called fMP4 or CMAF) or the MPEG-2 form (also called
#' TS chunks, which the HLS specification also supports). For more
#' information about HLS fragment types, see the [HLS
#' specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23).
#' 
#' The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:
#' 
#' 1.  Get an endpoint using
#'     [GetDataEndpoint](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html),
#'     specifying `GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL` for the `APIName`
#'     parameter.
#' 
#' 2.  Retrieve the HLS URL using `GetHLSStreamingSessionURL`. Kinesis
#'     Video Streams creates an HLS streaming session to be used for
#'     accessing content in a stream using the HLS protocol.
#'     `GetHLSStreamingSessionURL` returns an authenticated URL (that
#'     includes an encrypted session token) for the session\'s HLS *master
#'     playlist* (the root resource needed for streaming with HLS).
#' 
#'     Don\'t share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could
#'     access it. The token provides access to the content of the stream.
#'     Safeguard the token with the same measures that you would use with
#'     your AWS credentials.
#' 
#'     The media that is made available through the playlist consists only
#'     of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data
#'     (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates)
#'     is made available.
#' 
#' 3.  Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the HLS
#'     master playlist to a media player that supports the HLS protocol.
#'     Kinesis Video Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization
#'     fragment, and media fragments available through the master playlist
#'     URL. The initialization fragment contains the codec private data for
#'     the stream, and other data needed to set up the video or audio
#'     decoder and renderer. The media fragments contain H.264-encoded
#'     video frames or AAC-encoded audio samples.
#' 
#' 4.  The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream
#'     metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests
#'     data, it calls the following actions:
#' 
#'     -   **GetHLSMasterPlaylist:** Retrieves an HLS master playlist,
#'         which contains a URL for the `GetHLSMediaPlaylist` action for
#'         each track, and additional metadata for the media player,
#'         including estimated bitrate and resolution.
#' 
#'     -   **GetHLSMediaPlaylist:** Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which
#'         contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with
#'         the `GetMP4InitFragment` action, and URLs to access the MP4
#'         media fragments with the `GetMP4MediaFragment` actions. The HLS
#'         media playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the
#'         player needs to play it, such as whether the `PlaybackMode` is
#'         `LIVE` or `ON_DEMAND`. The HLS media playlist is typically
#'         static for sessions with a `PlaybackType` of `ON_DEMAND`. The
#'         HLS media playlist is continually updated with new fragments for
#'         sessions with a `PlaybackType` of `LIVE`. There is a distinct
#'         HLS media playlist for the video track and the audio track (if
#'         applicable) that contains MP4 media URLs for the specific track.
#' 
#'     -   **GetMP4InitFragment:** Retrieves the MP4 initialization
#'         fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization
#'         fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment
#'         contains the \"`fytp`\" and \"`moov`\" MP4 atoms, and the child
#'         atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.
#' 
#'         The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in
#'         a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data
#'         for the stream and respective track, which the media player
#'         needs to decode the media frames.
#' 
#'     -   **GetMP4MediaFragment:** Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
#'         fragments contain the \"`moof`\" and \"`mdat`\" MP4 atoms and
#'         their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment\'s media
#'         frames and their timestamps.
#' 
#'         After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming
#'         session, any fragments that don\'t contain the same codec
#'         private data cause an error to be returned when those different
#'         media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec private data
#'         should not change between fragments in a session. This also
#'         means that the session fails if the fragments in a stream change
#'         from having only video to having both audio and video.
#' 
#'         Data retrieved with this action is billable. See
#'         [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/)
#'         for details.
#' 
#'     -   **GetTSFragment:** Retrieves MPEG TS fragments containing both
#'         initialization and media data for all tracks in the stream.
#' 
#'         If the `ContainerFormat` is `MPEG_TS`, this API is used instead
#'         of `GetMP4InitFragment` and `GetMP4MediaFragment` to retrieve
#'         stream media.
#' 
#'         Data retrieved with this action is billable. For more
#'         information, see [Kinesis Video Streams
#'         pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/).
#' 
#' The following restrictions apply to HLS sessions:
#' 
#' -   A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The
#'     service might throttle a session if multiple media players are
#'     sharing it. For connection limits, see [Kinesis Video Streams
#'     Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html).
#' 
#' -   A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of ten active HLS
#'     streaming sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum
#'     number of sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created)
#'     session is closed. The number of active `GetMedia` connections on a
#'     Kinesis video stream does not count against this limit, and the
#'     number of active HLS sessions does not count against the active
#'     `GetMedia` connection limit.
#' 
#'     The maximum limits for active HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming sessions
#'     are independent of each other.
#' 
#' You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
#' monitoring the `GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes` Amazon CloudWatch
#' metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video
#' Streams, see [Monitoring Kinesis Video
#' Streams](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/monitoring.html).
#' For pricing information, see [Amazon Kinesis Video Streams
#' Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/) and [AWS
#' Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/). Charges for both HLS sessions
#' and outgoing AWS data apply.
#' 
#' For more information about HLS, see [HTTP Live
#' Streaming](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/) on the [Apple
#' Developer site](https://developer.apple.com).
#' 
#' If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived
#' media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it
#' includes the following pieces of information:
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-ErrorType` HTTP header -- contains a more specific error type
#'     in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.
#' 
#' -   `x-amz-RequestId` HTTP header -- if you want to report an issue to
#'     AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
#'     Request Id.
#' 
#' Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to
#' make programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and
#' under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions
#' the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully try
#' again.

#' @usage
#' kinesisvideoarchivedmedia_get_hls_streaming_session_url(StreamName,
#'   StreamARN, PlaybackMode, HLSFragmentSelector, ContainerFormat,
#'   DiscontinuityMode, DisplayFragmentTimestamp, Expires,
#'   MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults)
#'
#' @param StreamName The name of the stream for which to retrieve the HLS master playlist
#' URL.
#' 
#' You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
#' @param StreamARN The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which to retrieve the
#' HLS master playlist URL.
#' 
#' You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
#' @param PlaybackMode Whether to retrieve live, live replay, or archived, on-demand data.
#' 
#' Features of the three types of sessions include the following:
#' 
#' -   **`LIVE`** : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is
#'     continually updated with the latest fragments as they become
#'     available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new
#'     playlist on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
#'     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
#'     \"live\" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
#'     position in the playback window to display.
#' 
#'     In `LIVE` mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
#'     HLS media playlist, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
#'     is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
#'     player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
#'     are not added to the HLS media playlist if they are older than the
#'     newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
#'     available after a subsequent fragment is added to the playlist, the
#'     older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
#' 
#' -   **`LIVE_REPLAY`** : For sessions of this type, the HLS media
#'     playlist is updated similarly to how it is updated for `LIVE` mode
#'     except that it starts by including fragments from a given start
#'     time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested,
#'     fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses.
#'     For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long,
#'     then a new fragment is added to the media playlist every two
#'     seconds. This mode is useful to be able to start playback from when
#'     an event is detected and continue live streaming media that has not
#'     yet been ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode
#'     is also useful to stream previously archived media without being
#'     limited by the 1,000 fragment limit in the `ON_DEMAND` mode.
#' 
#' -   **`ON_DEMAND`** : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist
#'     contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is
#'     specified in `MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults`. The playlist must be
#'     retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
#'     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
#'     scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to
#'     display.
#' 
#' In all playback modes, if `FragmentSelectorType` is
#' `PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP`, and if there are multiple fragments with the same
#' start timestamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that
#' is, the newer fragment) is included in the HLS media playlist. The other
#' fragments are not included. Fragments that have different timestamps but
#' have overlapping durations are still included in the HLS media playlist.
#' This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.
#' 
#' The default is `LIVE`.
#' @param HLSFragmentSelector The time range of the requested fragment and the source of the
#' timestamps.
#' 
#' This parameter is required if `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND` or
#' `LIVE_REPLAY`. This parameter is optional if PlaybackMode is`` `LIVE`.
#' If `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, the `FragmentSelectorType` can be set, but
#' the `TimestampRange` should not be set. If `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`
#' or `LIVE_REPLAY`, both `FragmentSelectorType` and `TimestampRange` must
#' be set.
#' @param ContainerFormat Specifies which format should be used for packaging the media.
#' Specifying the `FRAGMENTED_MP4` container format packages the media into
#' MP4 fragments (fMP4 or CMAF). This is the recommended packaging because
#' there is minimal packaging overhead. The other container format option
#' is `MPEG_TS`. HLS has supported MPEG TS chunks since it was released and
#' is sometimes the only supported packaging on older HLS players. MPEG TS
#' typically has a 5-25 percent packaging overhead. This means MPEG TS
#' typically requires 5-25 percent more bandwidth and cost than fMP4.
#' 
#' The default is `FRAGMENTED_MP4`.
#' @param DiscontinuityMode Specifies when flags marking discontinuities between fragments are added
#' to the media playlists.
#' 
#' Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based
#' on the timestamps of each fragment. This means that if there is any
#' overlap or gap between fragments (as is typical if HLSFragmentSelector
#' is set to `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`), the media player timeline will also have
#' small gaps between fragments in some places, and will overwrite frames
#' in other places. Gaps in the media player timeline can cause playback to
#' stall and overlaps can cause playback to be jittery. When there are
#' discontinuity flags between fragments, the media player is expected to
#' reset the timeline, resulting in the next fragment being played
#' immediately after the previous fragment.
#' 
#' The following modes are supported:
#' 
#' -   `ALWAYS`: a discontinuity marker is placed between every fragment in
#'     the HLS media playlist. It is recommended to use a value of `ALWAYS`
#'     if the fragment timestamps are not accurate.
#' 
#' -   `NEVER`: no discontinuity markers are placed anywhere. It is
#'     recommended to use a value of `NEVER` to ensure the media player
#'     timeline most accurately maps to the producer timestamps.
#' 
#' -   `ON_DISCONTIUNITY`: a discontinuity marker is placed between
#'     fragments that have a gap or overlap of more than 50 milliseconds.
#'     For most playback scenarios, it is recommended to use a value of
#'     `ON_DISCONTINUITY` so that the media player timeline is only reset
#'     when there is a significant issue with the media timeline (e.g. a
#'     missing fragment).
#' 
#' The default is `ALWAYS` when HLSFragmentSelector is set to
#' `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, and `NEVER` when it is set to `PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP`.
#' @param DisplayFragmentTimestamp Specifies when the fragment start timestamps should be included in the
#' HLS media playlist. Typically, media players report the playhead
#' position as a time relative to the start of the first fragment in the
#' playback session. However, when the start timestamps are included in the
#' HLS media playlist, some media players might report the current playhead
#' as an absolute time based on the fragment timestamps. This can be useful
#' for creating a playback experience that shows viewers the wall-clock
#' time of the media.
#' 
#' The default is `NEVER`. When HLSFragmentSelector is `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`,
#' the timestamps will be the server start timestamps. Similarly, when
#' HLSFragmentSelector is `PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP`, the timestamps will be the
#' producer start timestamps.
#' @param Expires The time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value can
#' be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).
#' 
#' When a session expires, no new calls to `GetHLSMasterPlaylist`,
#' `GetHLSMediaPlaylist`, `GetMP4InitFragment`, `GetMP4MediaFragment`, or
#' `GetTSFragment` can be made for that session.
#' 
#' The default is 300 (5 minutes).
#' @param MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults The maximum number of fragments that are returned in the HLS media
#' playlists.
#' 
#' When the `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, the most recent fragments are
#' returned up to this value. When the `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`, the
#' oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.
#' 
#' When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live HLS
#' media playlist, video players often buffer content before starting
#' playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but
#' it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback.
#' We recommend that a live HLS media playlist have a minimum of 3
#' fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.
#' 
#' The default is 5 fragments if `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE` or `LIVE_REPLAY`,
#' and 1,000 if `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`.
#' 
#' The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16 minutes
#' of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2 1/2 hours
#' of video on streams with 10-second fragments.
