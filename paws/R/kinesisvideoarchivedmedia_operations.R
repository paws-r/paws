#' Retrieves an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) URL for the stream
#'
#' Retrieves an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) URL for the stream. You can then
#' open the URL in a browser or media player to view the stream contents.
#' 
#' You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
#' 
#' An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
#' providing data through HLS:
#' 
#' -   The media type must be `video/h264`.
#' 
#' -   Data retention must be greater than 0.
#' 
#' -   The fragments must contain codec private data in the AVC (Advanced
#'     Video Coding) for H.264 format ([MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC
#'     14496-15](https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html)). For information
#'     about adapting stream data to a given format, see [NAL Adaptation
#'     Flags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html).
#' 
#' Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the fragmented
#' MPEG-4 form (also called fMP4 or CMAF), rather than the MPEG-2 form
#' (also called TS chunks, which the HLS specification also supports). For
#' more information about HLS fragment types, see the [HLS
#' specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23).
#' 
#' The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:
#' 
#' 1.  Get an endpoint using
#'     [GetDataEndpoint](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html),
#'     specifying `GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL` for the `APIName`
#'     parameter.
#' 
#' 2.  Retrieve the HLS URL using `GetHLSStreamingSessionURL`. Kinesis
#'     Video Streams creates an HLS streaming session to be used for
#'     accessing content in a stream using the HLS protocol.
#'     `GetHLSStreamingSessionURL` returns an authenticated URL (that
#'     includes an encrypted session token) for the session\'s HLS *master
#'     playlist* (the root resource needed for streaming with HLS).
#' 
#'     Don\'t share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could
#'     access it. The token provides access to the content of the stream.
#'     Safeguard the token with the same measures that you would use with
#'     your AWS credentials.
#' 
#'     The media that is made available through the playlist consists only
#'     of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data
#'     (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bit rates)
#'     is made available.
#' 
#' 3.  Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the HLS
#'     master playlist to a media player that supports the HLS protocol.
#'     Kinesis Video Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization
#'     fragment, and media fragments available through the master playlist
#'     URL. The initialization fragment contains the codec private data for
#'     the stream, and other data needed to set up the video decoder and
#'     renderer. The media fragments contain H.264-encoded video frames and
#'     time stamps.
#' 
#' 4.  The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream
#'     metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests
#'     data, it calls the following actions:
#' 
#'     -   **GetHLSMasterPlaylist:** Retrieves an HLS master playlist,
#'         which contains a URL for the `GetHLSMediaPlaylist` action, and
#'         additional metadata for the media player, including estimated
#'         bit rate and resolution.
#' 
#'     -   **GetHLSMediaPlaylist:** Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which
#'         contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with
#'         the `GetMP4InitFragment` action, and URLs to access the MP4
#'         media fragments with the `GetMP4MediaFragment` actions. The HLS
#'         media playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the
#'         player needs to play it, such as whether the `PlaybackMode` is
#'         `LIVE` or `ON_DEMAND`. The HLS media playlist is typically
#'         static for sessions with a `PlaybackType` of `ON_DEMAND`. The
#'         HLS media playlist is continually updated with new fragments for
#'         sessions with a `PlaybackType` of `LIVE`.
#' 
#'     -   **GetMP4InitFragment:** Retrieves the MP4 initialization
#'         fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization
#'         fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment
#'         contains the \"`fytp`\" and \"`moov`\" MP4 atoms, and the child
#'         atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.
#' 
#'         The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in
#'         a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data
#'         for the stream, which the media player needs to decode video
#'         frames.
#' 
#'     -   **GetMP4MediaFragment:** Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
#'         fragments contain the \"`moof`\" and \"`mdat`\" MP4 atoms and
#'         their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment\'s video
#'         frames and their time stamps.
#' 
#'         After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming
#'         session, any fragments that don\'t contain the same codec
#'         private data are excluded in the HLS media playlist. Therefore,
#'         the codec private data does not change between fragments in a
#'         session.
#' 
#'         Data retrieved with this action is billable. See
#'         [Pricing](aws.amazon.comkinesis/video-streams/pricing/) for
#'         details.
#' 
#' The following restrictions apply to HLS sessions:
#' 
#' -   A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The
#'     service might throttle a session if multiple media players are
#'     sharing it. For connection limits, see [Kinesis Video Streams
#'     Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html).
#' 
#' -   A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of five active HLS
#'     streaming sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum
#'     number of sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created)
#'     session is closed. The number of active `GetMedia` connections on a
#'     Kinesis video stream does not count against this limit, and the
#'     number of active HLS sessions does not count against the active
#'     `GetMedia` connection limit.
#' 
#' You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
#' monitoring the `GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes` Amazon CloudWatch
#' metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video
#' Streams, see [Monitoring Kinesis Video
#' Streams](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/monitoring.html).
#' For pricing information, see [Amazon Kinesis Video Streams
#' Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/) and [AWS
#' Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/). Charges for both HLS sessions
#' and outgoing AWS data apply.

#' Streaming](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/) on the [Apple
#' Developer site](https://developer.apple.com).

#' @usage
#' kinesisvideoarchivedmedia_get_hls_streaming_session_url(StreamName,
#'   StreamARN, PlaybackMode, HLSFragmentSelector, DiscontinuityMode,
#'   Expires, MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults)
#'
#' @param StreamName The name of the stream for which to retrieve the HLS master playlist
#' URL.
#' 
#' You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
#' @param StreamARN The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which to retrieve the
#' HLS master playlist URL.
#' 
#' You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
#' @param PlaybackMode Whether to retrieve live or archived, on-demand data.
#' 
#' Features of the two types of session include the following:
#' 
#' -   **`LIVE`** : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is
#'     continually updated with the latest fragments as they become
#'     available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new
#'     playlist on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
#'     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
#'     \"live\" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
#'     position in the playback window to display.
#' 
#'     In `LIVE` mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
#'     HLS media playlist, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
#'     is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
#'     player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
#'     are not added to the HLS media playlist if they are older than the
#'     newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
#'     available after a subsequent fragment is added to the playlist, the
#'     older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
#' 
#' -   **`ON_DEMAND`** : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist
#'     contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is
#'     specified in `MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults`. The playlist must be
#'     retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
#'     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
#'     scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to
#'     display.
#' 
#' In both playback modes, if `FragmentSelectorType` is
#' `PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP`, and if there are multiple fragments with the same
#' start time stamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that
#' is, the newer fragment) is included in the HLS media playlist. The other
#' fragments are not included. Fragments that have different time stamps
#' but have overlapping durations are still included in the HLS media
#' playlist. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.
#' 
#' The default is `LIVE`.
#' @param HLSFragmentSelector The time range of the requested fragment, and the source of the time
#' stamps.
#' 
#' This parameter is required if `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`. This
#' parameter is optional if `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`. If `PlaybackMode` is
#' `LIVE`, the `FragmentSelectorType` can be set, but the `TimestampRange`
#' should not be set. If `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`, both
#' `FragmentSelectorType` and `TimestampRange` must be set.
#' @param DiscontinuityMode Specifies when flags marking discontinuities between fragments will be
#' added to the media playlists. The default is `ALWAYS` when
#' HLSFragmentSelector is `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, and `NEVER` when it is
#' `PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP`.
#' 
#' Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based
#' on the time stamps of each fragment. This means that if there is any
#' overlap between fragments (as is typical if HLSFragmentSelector is
#' `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`), the media player timeline has small gaps between
#' fragments in some places, and overwrites frames in other places. When
#' there are discontinuity flags between fragments, the media player is
#' expected to reset the timeline, resulting in the fragment being played
#' immediately after the previous fragment. We recommend that you always
#' have discontinuity flags between fragments if the fragment time stamps
#' are not accurate or if fragments might be missing. You should not place
#' discontinuity flags between fragments for the player timeline to
#' accurately map to the producer time stamps.
#' @param Expires The time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value can
#' be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).
#' 
#' When a session expires, no new calls to `GetHLSMasterPlaylist`,
#' `GetHLSMediaPlaylist`, `GetMP4InitFragment`, or `GetMP4MediaFragment`
#' can be made for that session.
#' 
#' The default is 300 (5 minutes).
#' @param MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults The maximum number of fragments that are returned in the HLS media
#' playlists.
#' 
#' When the `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, the most recent fragments are
#' returned up to this value. When the `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`, the
#' oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.
#' 
#' When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live HLS
#' media playlist, video players often buffer content before starting
#' playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but
#' it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback.
#' We recommend that a live HLS media playlist have a minimum of 3
#' fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.
#' 
#' The default is 5 fragments if `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, and 1,000 if
#' `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`.
#' 
#' The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16 minutes
#' of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2 1/2 hours
#' of video on streams with 10-second fragments.
