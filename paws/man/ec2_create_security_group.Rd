\description{
Creates a security group.

\details{
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control
inbound and outbound traffic. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html}{Amazon EC2 Security Groups}
in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide} and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html}{Security Groups for Your VPC}
in the \emph{Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide}.

When you create a security group, you specify a friendly name of your
choice. You can have a security group for use in EC2-Classic with the
same name as a security group for use in a VPC. However, you can\'t have
two security groups for use in EC2-Classic with the same name or two
security groups for use in a VPC with the same name.

You have a default security group for use in EC2-Classic and a default
security group for use in your VPC. If you don\'t specify a security
group when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into the
appropriate default security group. A default security group includes a
default rule that grants instances unrestricted network access to each
other.

You can add or remove rules from your security groups using
AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress, AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress,
RevokeSecurityGroupIngress, and RevokeSecurityGroupEgress.
