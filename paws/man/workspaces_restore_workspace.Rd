\description{
Restores the specified WorkSpace to its last known healthy state.
}
\details{
You cannot restore a WorkSpace unless its state is \code{ AVAILABLE},
\code{ERROR}, or \code{UNHEALTHY}.

Restoring a WorkSpace is a potentially destructive action that can
result in the loss of data. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/restore-workspace.html}{Restore a WorkSpace}.

This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpace is
completely restored.
