\title{This operation creates a new vault with the specified name}
\usage{
glacier_create_vault(accountId, vaultName)
}
\arguments{
\item{accountId}{[required] The \code{AccountId} value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single \'\code{-}\'
(hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID
associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you specify
your account ID, do not include any hyphens (\'-\') in the ID.}

\item{vaultName}{[required] The name of the vault.}
}
\description{
This operation creates a new vault with the specified name. The name of
the vault must be unique within a region for an AWS account. You can
create up to 1,000 vaults per account. If you need to create more
vaults, contact Amazon S3 Glacier.
}
\details{
You must use the following guidelines when naming a vault.
\itemize{
\item Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long.
\item Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \'\\_\' (underscore), \'-\'
(hyphen), and \'.\' (period).
}

This operation is idempotent.

An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any
permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
perform specific actions. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html}{Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)}.
