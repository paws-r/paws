\description{
The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need
detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types.
This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases
programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON
format.

The AWS Support service also exposes a set of \href{http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/}{Trusted Advisor} features.
You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check
results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of
checks.

The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels.}
The DescribeServices and DescribeSeverityLevels operations return
AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem
severity levels. You use these values when you call the CreateCase
operation.
\item \strong{Case creation, case details, and case resolution.} The
CreateCase, DescribeCases, DescribeAttachment, and ResolveCase
operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about
cases, and resolve cases.
\item \strong{Case communication.} The DescribeCommunications,
AddCommunicationToCase, and AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve
and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.
}

The following list describes the operations available from the AWS
Support service for Trusted Advisor:
\itemize{
\item DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run
against your AWS resources.
\item Using the \code{checkId} for a specific check returned by
DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call
DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult to obtain the results for the
check you specified.
\item DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for
one or more Trusted Advisor checks.
\item RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a
specified check.
\item DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh
status of one or more checks.
}

For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html}{Signature Version 4 Signing Process}.

See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html}{About the AWS Support API} in
the \emph{AWS Support User Guide} for information about how to use this
service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted
Advisor for results of checks on your resources.
