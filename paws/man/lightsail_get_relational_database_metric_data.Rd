\title{Returns the data points of the specified metric for a database in Amazon
Lightsail}
\usage{
lightsail_get_relational_database_metric_data(relationalDatabaseName,
  metricName, period, startTime, endTime, unit, statistics)
}
\arguments{
\item{relationalDatabaseName}{[required] The name of your database from which to get metric data.}

\item{metricName}{[required] The metric for which you want to return information.

Valid relational database metric names are listed below, along with the
most useful \code{statistics} to include in your request, and the published
\code{unit} value. All relational database metric data is available in
1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{CPUUtilization}} - The percentage of CPU utilization currently
in use on the database.

\code{Statistics}: The most useful statistics are \code{Maximum} and
\code{Average}.

\code{Unit}: The published unit is \code{Percent}.
\item \strong{\code{DatabaseConnections}} - The number of database connections in
use.

\code{Statistics}: The most useful statistics are \code{Maximum} and \code{Sum}.

\code{Unit}: The published unit is \code{Count}.
\item \strong{\code{DiskQueueDepth}} - The number of outstanding IOs (read/write
requests) that are waiting to access the disk.

\code{Statistics}: The most useful statistic is \code{Sum}.

\code{Unit}: The published unit is \code{Count}.
\item \strong{\code{FreeStorageSpace}} - The amount of available storage space.

\code{Statistics}: The most useful statistic is \code{Sum}.

\code{Unit}: The published unit is \code{Bytes}.
\item \strong{\code{NetworkReceiveThroughput}} - The incoming (Receive) network
traffic on the database, including both customer database traffic
and AWS traffic used for monitoring and replication.

\code{Statistics}: The most useful statistic is \code{Average}.

\code{Unit}: The published unit is \code{Bytes/Second}.
\item \strong{\code{NetworkTransmitThroughput}} - The outgoing (Transmit) network
traffic on the database, including both customer database traffic
and AWS traffic used for monitoring and replication.

\code{Statistics}: The most useful statistic is \code{Average}.

\code{Unit}: The published unit is \code{Bytes/Second}.
}}

\item{period}{[required] The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points.

All relational database metric data is available in 1-minute (60
seconds) granularity.}

\item{startTime}{[required] The start of the time interval from which to get metric data.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
\item Specified in the Unix time format.

For example, if you wish to use a start time of October 1, 2018, at
8 PM UTC, then you input \code{1538424000} as the start time.
}}

\item{endTime}{[required] The end of the time interval from which to get metric data.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
\item Specified in the Unix time format.

For example, if you wish to use an end time of October 1, 2018, at 8
PM UTC, then you input \code{1538424000} as the end time.
}}

\item{unit}{[required] The unit for the metric data request. Valid units depend on the metric
data being requested. For the valid units with each available metric,
see the \code{metricName} parameter.}

\item{statistics}{[required] The statistic for the metric.

The following statistics are available:
\itemize{
\item \code{Minimum} - The lowest value observed during the specified period.
Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for your
application.
\item \code{Maximum} - The highest value observed during the specified period.
Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your
application.
\item \code{Sum} - All values submitted for the matching metric added together.
You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a
metric.
\item \code{Average} - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified
period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum
values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This
comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your
resources.
\item \code{SampleCount} - The count, or number, of data points used for the
statistical calculation.
}}

\details{
Metrics report the utilization of your resources, and the error counts
generated by them. Monitor and collect metric data regularly to maintain
the reliability, availability, and performance of your resources.
