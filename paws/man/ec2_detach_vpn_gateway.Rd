\description{
Detaches a virtual private gateway from a VPC. You do this if you\'re
planning to turn off the VPC and not use it anymore. You can confirm a
virtual private gateway has been completely detached from a VPC by
describing the virtual private gateway (any attachments to the virtual
private gateway are also described).
}
\details{
You must wait for the attachment\'s state to switch to \code{detached} before
you can delete the VPC or attach a different VPC to the virtual private
gateway.
