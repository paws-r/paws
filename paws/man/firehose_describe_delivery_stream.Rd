\title{Describes the specified delivery stream and its status}
\usage{
firehose_describe_delivery_stream(DeliveryStreamName, Limit,
  ExclusiveStartDestinationId)
}
\arguments{
\item{DeliveryStreamName}{[required] The name of the delivery stream.}

\item{Limit}{The limit on the number of destinations to return. You can have one
destination per delivery stream.}

\item{ExclusiveStartDestinationId}{The ID of the destination to start returning the destination
information. Kinesis Data Firehose supports one destination per delivery
stream.}
}
\description{
Describes the specified delivery stream and its status. For example,
after your delivery stream is created, call \code{DescribeDeliveryStream} to
see whether the delivery stream is \code{ACTIVE} and therefore ready for data
to be sent to it.
}
\details{
If the status of a delivery stream is \code{CREATING_FAILED}, this status
doesn\'t change, and you can\'t invoke CreateDeliveryStream again on it.
However, you can invoke the DeleteDeliveryStream operation to delete it.
If the status is \code{DELETING_FAILED}, you can force deletion by invoking
DeleteDeliveryStream again but with
DeleteDeliveryStreamInput\\$AllowForceDelete set to true.
