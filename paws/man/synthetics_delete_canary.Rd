Permanently deletes the specified canary.
}
\details{
When you delete a canary, resources used and created by the canary are
not automatically deleted. After you delete a canary that you do not
intend to use again, you should also delete the following:
\itemize{
\item The Lambda functions and layers used by this canary. These have the
prefix \verb{cwsyn-<i>MyCanaryName</i> }.
\item The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These alarms have a
name of \verb{Synthetics-SharpDrop-Alarm-<i>MyCanaryName</i> }.
\item Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the canary\'s artifact
location.
\item IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created in the
console, these roles have the name
\verb{role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-<i>MyCanaryName</i>}.
\item CloudWatch Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups
have the name \verb{/aws/lambda/cwsyn-<i>MyCanaryName</i> }.
}

Before you delete a canary, you might want to use \code{GetCanary} to display
the information about this canary. Make note of the information returned
by this operation so that you can delete these resources after you
delete the canary.
