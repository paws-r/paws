\usage{
gamelift_update_matchmaking_configuration(Name, Description,
  GameSessionQueueArns, RequestTimeoutSeconds, AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds,
  AcceptanceRequired, RuleSetName, NotificationTarget,
  AdditionalPlayerCount, CustomEventData, GameProperties, GameSessionData,
  BackfillMode)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] A unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration to update. You can
use either the configuration name or ARN value.}

\item{Description}{A descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking configuration.}

\item{GameSessionQueueArns}{Amazon Resource Name
(\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html}{ARN})
that is assigned to a GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely
identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. These queues are used
when placing game sessions for matches that are created with this
matchmaking configuration. Queues can be located in any Region.}

\item{RequestTimeoutSeconds}{The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain
in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can
be resubmitted as needed.}

\item{AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds}{The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed
match. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the
timeout, the ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.}

\item{AcceptanceRequired}{A flag that indicates whether a match that was created with this
configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require
acceptance, set to TRUE.}

\item{RuleSetName}{A unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this
configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A
matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the
same Region.}

\item{NotificationTarget}{An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications.
See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-notification.html}{Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking}
for more information.}

\item{AdditionalPlayerCount}{The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players.
For example, assume that the configuration\'s rule set specifies a match
for a single 12-person team. If the additional player count is set to 2,
only 10 players are initially selected for the match.}

\item{CustomEventData}{Information to add to all events related to the matchmaking
configuration.}

\item{GameProperties}{A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key-value
pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the
GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession}{Start a Game Session}).
This information is added to the new GameSession object that is created
for a successful match.}

\item{GameSessionData}{A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string
value. This data is passed to a game server process in the GameSession
object with a request to start a new game session (see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession}{Start a Game Session}).
This information is added to the new GameSession object that is created
for a successful match.}

\item{BackfillMode}{The method that is used to backfill game sessions created with this
matchmaking configuration. Specify MANUAL when your game manages
backfill requests manually or does not use the match backfill feature.
Specify AUTOMATIC to have GameLift create a StartMatchBackfill request
whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more about
manual and automatic backfill in \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-backfill.html}{Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch}.}
