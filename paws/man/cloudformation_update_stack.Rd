}
\arguments{
\item{StackName}{[required] The name or unique stack ID of the stack to update.}

\item{TemplateBody}{Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte
and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. (For more information, go to
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html}{Template Anatomy}
in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.)

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
\code{TemplateBody}, \code{TemplateURL}, or set the \code{UsePreviousTemplate} to
\code{true}.}

\item{TemplateURL}{Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a
template that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information,
go to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html}{Template Anatomy}
in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
\code{TemplateBody}, \code{TemplateURL}, or set the \code{UsePreviousTemplate} to
\code{true}.}

\item{UsePreviousTemplate}{Reuse the existing template that is associated with the stack that you
are updating.

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
\code{TemplateBody}, \code{TemplateURL}, or set the \code{UsePreviousTemplate} to
\code{true}.}

\item{StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody}{Structure containing the temporary overriding stack policy body. You can
specify either the \code{StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody} or the
\code{StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL} parameter, but not both.

If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary
overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not specify a
stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will
be used.}

\item{StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL}{Location of a file containing the temporary overriding stack policy. The
URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in
the same region as the stack. You can specify either the
\code{StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody} or the \code{StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL}
parameter, but not both.

If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary
overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not specify a
stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will
be used.}

\item{Parameters}{A list of \code{Parameter} structures that specify input parameters for the
stack. For more information, see the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html}{Parameter}
data type.}

\item{Capabilities}{In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to update
the stack.
\itemize{
\item \code{CAPABILITY_IAM} and \code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM}

Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS
Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you
must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these
capabilities.

The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
\code{CAPABILITY_IAM} or \code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM} capability.
\itemize{
\item If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
\item If you have IAM resources with custom names, you \emph{must} specify
\code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM}.
\item If you don\'t specify either of these capabilities, AWS
CloudFormation returns an \code{InsufficientCapabilities} error.
}

If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
permissions if necessary.

\item \code{CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND}

Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from
the processed template, so that they can review the changes
resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If
your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
update a stack directly from the processed template, without first
reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
acknowledge this capability. This includes the
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html}{AWS::Include}
and
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html}{AWS::Serverless}
transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.

Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to
update a stack from a stack template that contains macros \emph{and}
nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template
using this capability.

You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that
contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.

Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for
processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner
can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being
notified.

For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html}{Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates}.
}}

\item{ResourceTypes}{The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for
this update stack action, such as \verb{AWS::EC2::Instance}, \verb{AWS::EC2::*},
or \code{Custom::MyCustomInstance}.

If the list of resource types doesn\'t include a resource that you\'re
updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants
permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) uses this parameter for AWS CloudFormation-specific condition keys
in IAM policies. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html}{Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management}.}

\item{RoleARN}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to update the stack. AWS
CloudFormation uses the role\'s credentials to make calls on your
behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future
operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on
the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don\'t
have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

If you don\'t specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was
previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS
CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user
credentials.}

\item{RollbackConfiguration}{The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack
creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring
period afterwards.}

\item{StackPolicyBody}{Structure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either the
\code{StackPolicyBody} or the \code{StackPolicyURL} parameter, but not both.

You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a
new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not
specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the
stack is unchanged.}

\item{StackPolicyURL}{Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must
point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same
region as the stack. You can specify either the \code{StackPolicyBody} or the
\code{StackPolicyURL} parameter, but not both.

You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a
new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not
specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the
stack is unchanged.}

\item{NotificationARNs}{Amazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack. Specify an empty list
to remove all notification topics.}

\item{Tags}{Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also
propagates these tags to supported resources in the stack. You can
specify a maximum number of 50 tags.

If you don\'t specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn\'t modify
the stack\'s tags. If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation
removes all associated tags.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{A unique identifier for this \code{UpdateStack} request. Specify this token
if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that
you\'re not attempting to update a stack with the same name. You might
retry \code{UpdateStack} requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation
successfully received them.

All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same
client request token, which you can use to track operations. For
example, if you execute a \code{CreateStack} operation with the token
\code{token1}, then all the \code{StackEvents} generated by that operation will
have \code{ClientRequestToken} set as \code{token1}.

In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the
Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the
token format \emph{Console-StackOperation-ID}, which helps you easily
identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using
the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the
following format:
\verb{Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002}.}
}
\description{
Updates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes
successfully, the stack update starts. You can check the status of the
stack via the DescribeStacks action.
}
\details{
To get a copy of the template for an existing stack, you can use the
GetTemplate action.

stack, and monitoring the progress of the update, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html}{Updating a Stack}.
