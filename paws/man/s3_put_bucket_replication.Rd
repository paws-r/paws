\title{Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one}
\usage{
s3_put_bucket_replication(Bucket, ContentMD5, ReplicationConfiguration,
  Token)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket}

\item{ContentMD5}{The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. You must use this
header as a message integrity check to verify that the request body was
not corrupted in transit. For more information, see \href{http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt}{RFC 1864}.}

\item{ReplicationConfiguration}{[required]}

\item{Token}{}
}
\description{
Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For
more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html}{Replication}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Developer Guide}.
}
\details{
To perform this operation, the user or role performing the operation
must have the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html}{iam:PassRole}
permission.

Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the
replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination
bucket where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that
Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and other
relevant information.

A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can
contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to
replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose
additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.
All rules must specify the same destination bucket.

To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a
replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule
element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or
more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the
configuration, you must also add the following elements:
\code{DeleteMarkerReplication}, \code{Status}, and \code{Priority}.

For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html}{Using Versioning}.

By default, a resource owner, in this case the AWS account that created
the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also
grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information
about permissions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html}{Specifying Permissions in a Policy}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html}{Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources}.

\strong{Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects}

By default, Amazon S3 doesn\'t replicate objects that are stored at rest
using server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS. To replicate
AWS KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: \code{SourceSelectionCriteria},
\code{SseKmsEncryptedObjects}, \code{Status}, \code{EncryptionConfiguration}, and
\code{ReplicaKmsKeyID}. For information about replication configuration, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html}{Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using CMKs stored in AWS KMS}.
