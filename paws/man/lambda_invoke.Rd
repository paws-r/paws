\title{Invokes a Lambda function}
\usage{
lambda_invoke(FunctionName, InvocationType, LogType, ClientContext,
  Payload, Qualifier)
}
\arguments{
\item{FunctionName}{[required] The name of the Lambda function, version, or alias.

\strong{Name formats}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Function name} - \verb{my-function} (name-only), \verb{my-function:v1}
(with alias).
\item \strong{Function ARN} -
\verb{arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function}.
\item \strong{Partial ARN} - \verb{123456789012:function:my-function}.
}

You can append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The
length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the
function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.}

\item{InvocationType}{Choose from the following options.
\itemize{
\item \code{RequestResponse} (default) - Invoke the function synchronously.
Keep the connection open until the function returns a response or
times out. The API response includes the function response and
additional data.
\item \code{Event} - Invoke the function asynchronously. Send events that fail
multiple times to the function\'s dead-letter queue (if it\'s
configured). The API response only includes a status code.
\item \code{DryRun} - Validate parameter values and verify that the user or
role has permission to invoke the function.
}}

\item{LogType}{Set to \code{Tail} to include the execution log in the response.}

\item{ClientContext}{Up to 3583 bytes of base64-encoded data about the invoking client to
pass to the function in the context object.}

\item{Payload}{The JSON that you want to provide to your Lambda function as input.}

\item{Qualifier}{Specify a version or alias to invoke a published version of the
function.}
}
\description{
Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and
wait for the response), or asynchronously. To invoke a function
asynchronously, set \code{InvocationType} to \code{Event}.
}
\details{
For \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-sync.html}{synchronous invocation},
details about the function response, including errors, are included in
the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find
more information in the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html}{execution log}
and
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html}{trace}.

When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry
behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation
type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it
returns an error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/retries-on-errors.html}{Retry Behavior}.

For \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html}{asynchronous invocation},
Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function. If
your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue,
events may be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same
event multiple times, even if no error occurs. To retain events that
were not processed, configure your function with a \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#dlq}{dead-letter queue}.

The status code in the API response doesn\'t reflect function errors.
Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from
executing, such as permissions errors, \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html}{limit errors}, or
issues with your function\'s code and configuration. For example, Lambda
returns \code{TooManyRequestsException} if executing the function would cause
you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level
(\code{ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded}) or function level
(\code{ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded}).

For functions with a long timeout, your client might be disconnected
during synchronous invocation while it waits for a response. Configure
your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating system to allow for
long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings.

This operation requires permission for the \code{lambda:InvokeFunction}
action.
