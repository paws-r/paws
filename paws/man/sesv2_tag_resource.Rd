\description{
Add one or more tags (keys and values) to a specified resource. A
\emph{tag}Â is a label that you optionally define and associate with a
resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different
ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A
resource can have as many as 50 tags.
}
\details{
Each tag consists of a requiredÂ \emph{tag key}Â and an associatedÂ \emph{tag value},
both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a
category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts as a descriptor
within a tag key.
