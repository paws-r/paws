\usage{
lightsail_attach_load_balancer_tls_certificate(loadBalancerName,
  certificateName)
}
\arguments{

}
\description{
Attaches a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate to your load
balancer. TLS is just an updated, more secure version of Secure Socket
Layer (SSL).
}
\details{
Once you create and validate your certificate, you can attach it to your
load balancer. You can also use this API to rotate the certificates on
your account. Use the \verb{attach load balancer tls certificate} operation
with the non-attached certificate, and it will replace the existing one
and become the attached certificate.

The \verb{attach load balancer tls certificate} operation supports tag-based
access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by
\verb{load balancer name}. For more information, see the \href{https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags}{Lightsail Dev Guide}.
