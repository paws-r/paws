\usage{
cloudwatchevents_create_partner_event_source(Name, Account)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name of the partner event source. This name must be unique and must
be in the format
\verb{<i>partner_name</i>/<i>event_namespace</i>/<i>event_name</i>}. The
AWS account that wants to use this partner event source must create a
partner event bus with a name that matches the name of the partner event
source.}

\item{Account}{[required] The AWS account ID of the customer who is permitted to create a matching
partner event bus for this partner event source.}
}
\description{
Called by an SaaS partner to create a partner event source.
}
\details{
This operation is not used by AWS customers.

Each partner event source can be used by one AWS account to create a
matching partner event bus in that AWS account. A SaaS partner must
create one partner event source for each AWS account that wants to
receive those event types.

A partner event source creates events based on resources in the SaaS
partner\'s service or application.

An AWS account that creates a partner event bus that matches the partner
event source can use that event bus to receive events from the partner,
and then process them using AWS Events rules and targets.

Partner event source names follow this format:

\verb{aws.partner/<i>partner_name</i>/<i>event_namespace</i>/<i>event_name</i> }
\itemize{
\item \emph{partner\\_name} is determined during partner registration and
identifies the partner to AWS customers.
\item For \emph{event\\_namespace}, we recommend that partners use a string that
identifies the AWS customer within the partner\'s system. This
should not be the customer\'s AWS account ID.
\item \emph{event\\_name} is determined by the partner, and should uniquely
identify an event-generating resource within the partner system.
This should help AWS customers decide whether to create an event bus
to receive these events.
