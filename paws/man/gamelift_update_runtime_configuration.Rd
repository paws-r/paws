\title{Updates the current runtime configuration for the specified fleet, which
tells Amazon GameLift how to launch server processes on instances in the
fleet}
\usage{
gamelift_update_runtime_configuration(FleetId, RuntimeConfiguration)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetId}{[required] A unique identifier for a fleet to update runtime configuration for. You
can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.}

\item{RuntimeConfiguration}{[required] Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the
fleet. Server processes run either a custom game build executable or a
Realtime Servers script. The runtime configuration lists the types of
server processes to run on an instance and includes the following
configuration settings: the server executable or launch script file,
launch parameters, and the number of processes to run concurrently on
each instance. A CreateFleet request must include a runtime
configuration with at least one server process configuration.}
}
\description{
Updates the current runtime configuration for the specified fleet, which
tells Amazon GameLift how to launch server processes on instances in the
fleet. You can update a fleet\'s runtime configuration at any time after
the fleet is created; it does not need to be in an \code{ACTIVE} status.
}
\details{
To update runtime configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a
\code{RuntimeConfiguration} object with an updated set of server process
configurations.

Each instance in a Amazon GameLift fleet checks regularly for an updated
runtime configuration and changes how it launches server processes to
comply with the latest version. Existing server processes are not
affected by the update; runtime configuration changes are applied
gradually as existing processes shut down and new processes are launched
during Amazon GameLift\'s normal process recycling activity.
