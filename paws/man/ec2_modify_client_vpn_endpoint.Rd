\usage{
ec2_modify_client_vpn_endpoint(ClientVpnEndpointId,
  ServerCertificateArn, ConnectionLogOptions, DnsServers, Description,
  SplitTunnel, DryRun)
}
\arguments{
\item{ClientVpnEndpointId}{[required] The ID of the Client VPN endpoint to modify.}

\item{ServerCertificateArn}{The ARN of the server certificate to be used. The server certificate
must be provisioned in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).}

\item{ConnectionLogOptions}{Information about the client connection logging options.

If you enable client connection logging, data about client connections
is sent to a Cloudwatch Logs log stream. The following information is
logged:
\itemize{
\item Client connection requests
\item Client connection results (successful and unsuccessful)
\item Reasons for unsuccessful client connection requests
\item Client connection termination time
}}

\item{DnsServers}{Information about the DNS servers to be used by Client VPN connections.
A Client VPN endpoint can have up to two DNS servers.}

\item{Description}{A brief description of the Client VPN endpoint.}

\item{SplitTunnel}{Indicates whether the VPN is split-tunnel.

For information about split-tunnel VPN endpoints, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/split-tunnel-vpn.html}{Split-Tunnel AWS Client VPN Endpoint}
in the \emph{AWS Client VPN Administrator Guide}.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}
