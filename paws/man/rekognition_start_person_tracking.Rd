\title{Starts the asynchronous tracking of a person's path in a stored video}
\usage{
rekognition_start_person_tracking(Video, ClientRequestToken,
  NotificationChannel, JobTag)
}
\arguments{
\item{Video}{[required] The video in which you want to detect people. The video must be stored
in an Amazon S3 bucket.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use the same
token with multiple \code{StartPersonTracking} requests, the same \code{JobId} is
returned. Use \code{ClientRequestToken} to prevent the same job from being
accidently started more than once.}

\item{NotificationChannel}{The Amazon SNS topic ARN you want Amazon Rekognition Video to publish
the completion status of the people detection operation to.}

\item{JobTag}{An identifier you specify that\'s returned in the completion
notification that\'s published to your Amazon Simple Notification
Service topic. For example, you can use \code{JobTag} to group related jobs
and identify them in the completion notification.}
}
\description{

\details{
Amazon Rekognition Video can track the path of people in a video stored
in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Video to specify the bucket name and the
filename of the video. \code{StartPersonTracking} returns a job identifier
(\code{JobId}) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label
detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status
to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in
\code{NotificationChannel}.

To get the results of the person detection operation, first check that
the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is \code{SUCCEEDED}. If
so, call GetPersonTracking and pass the job identifier (\code{JobId}) from
the initial call to \code{StartPersonTracking}.
