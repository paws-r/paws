}
\arguments{

\description{
Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified QuickSight
resource.
}
\details{
Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also
use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to
access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use the
\code{TagResource} operation with a resource that already has tags. If you
specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list
of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is
already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify
replaces the previous value for that tag.

You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. QuickSight
supports tagging on data set, data source, dashboard, and template.

Tagging for QuickSight works in a similar way to tagging for other AWS
services, except for the following:
\itemize{
\item You can\'t use tags to track AWS costs for QuickSight. This
restriction is because QuickSight costs are based on users and SPICE
capacity, which aren\'t taggable resources.
\item QuickSight doesn\'t currently support the Tag Editor for AWS
Resource Groups.
