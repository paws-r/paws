\item{Rule}{[required] The name of the rule.}

\item{EventBusName}{The name of the event bus associated with the rule.}

\item{Ids}{[required] The IDs of the targets to remove from the rule.}

\item{Force}{If this is a managed rule created by an AWS service on your behalf, you
must specify \code{Force} as \code{True} to remove targets. This parameter is

Removes the specified targets from the specified rule. When the rule is
triggered, those targets are no longer be invoked.
}
\details{
When you remove a target, when the associated rule triggers, removed
targets might continue to be invoked. Allow a short period of time for
changes to take effect.

This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same
time. If that happens, \code{FailedEntryCount} is non-zero in the response
and each entry in \code{FailedEntries} provides the ID of the failed target
and the error code.
