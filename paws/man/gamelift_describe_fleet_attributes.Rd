\usage{
gamelift_describe_fleet_attributes(FleetIds, Limit, NextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetIds}{Unique identifier for a fleet(s) to retrieve attributes for. To request
attributes for all fleets, leave this parameter empty.}

\item{Limit}{Maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with \code{NextToken}
to get results as a set of sequential pages. This parameter is ignored
when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.}

\item{NextToken}{Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results.
Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To

\description{
Retrieves fleet properties, including metadata, status, and
configuration, for one or more fleets. You can request attributes for
all fleets, or specify a list of one or more fleet IDs. When requesting
multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a
set of sequential pages. If successful, a FleetAttributes object is
returned for each requested fleet ID. When specifying a list of fleet
IDs, attribute objects are returned only for fleets that currently
exist.
}
\details{
Some API actions may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one
request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the
error message includes the maximum allowed.
