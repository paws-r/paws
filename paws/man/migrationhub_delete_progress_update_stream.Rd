\description{
Deletes a progress update stream, including all of its tasks, which was
previously created as an AWS resource used for access control. This API
has the following traits:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The only parameter needed for \code{DeleteProgressUpdateStream} is the
stream name (same as a \code{CreateProgressUpdateStream} call).
\item The call will return, and a background process will asynchronously
delete the stream and all of its resources (tasks, associated
resources, resource attributes, created artifacts).
\item If the stream takes time to be deleted, it might still show up on a
\code{ListProgressUpdateStreams} call.
\item \code{CreateProgressUpdateStream}, \code{ImportMigrationTask},
\code{NotifyMigrationTaskState}, and all Associate[*] APIs related to
the tasks belonging to the stream will throw
\"InvalidInputException\" if the stream of the same name is in the
process of being deleted.
\item Once the stream and all of its resources are deleted,
\code{CreateProgressUpdateStream} for a stream of the same name will
succeed, and that stream will be an entirely new logical resource
(without any resources associated with the old stream).
