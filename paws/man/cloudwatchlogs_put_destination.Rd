\description{
Creates or updates a destination. This operation is used only to create
destinations for cross-account subscriptions.
}
\details{
A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon
Kinesis stream) and enables you to subscribe to a real-time stream of
log events for a different account, ingested using PutLogEvents.

Through an access policy, a destination controls what is written to it.
By default, \code{PutDestination} does not set any access policy with the
destination, which means a cross-account user cannot call
PutSubscriptionFilter against this destination. To enable this, the
destination owner must call PutDestinationPolicy after \code{PutDestination}.
