\item{config}{Optional configuration of credentials, endpoint, and/or region.}
}
\description{
Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security
state of your AWS environment and resources. It also provides you with
the compliance status of your environment based on CIS AWS Foundations
compliance checks. Security Hub collects security data from AWS
accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you
analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest
priority security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see
the \emph{\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html}{AWS Security Hub User Guide}}
.

When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are
executed only in the AWS Region that is currently active or in the
specific AWS Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration
or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to
that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same
command for each Region to apply the change to. For example, if your
Region is set to \code{us-west-2}, when you use \code{CreateMembers} to add a
member account to Security Hub, the association of the member account
with the master account is created only in the us-west-2 Region.
Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region
that the invite was sent from.

The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API
operations:
\itemize{
\item \code{GetFindings} - RateLimit of 3 requests per second, and a BurstLimit
of 6 requests per second.
\item \code{UpdateFindings} - RateLimit of 1 request per second, and a
BurstLimit of 5 requests per second.
\item All other operations - RateLimit of 10 request per second, and a
BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.
