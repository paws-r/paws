\title{Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3}
\usage{
ec2_create_snapshot(Description, VolumeId, TagSpecifications, DryRun)
}
\arguments{
\item{Description}{A description for the snapshot.}

\item{VolumeId}{[required] The ID of the EBS volume.}

\item{TagSpecifications}{The tags to apply to the snapshot during creation.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}
}
\description{
Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can
use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save
data before shutting down an instance.
}
\details{
When a snapshot is created, any AWS Marketplace product codes that are
associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot.

You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However,
snapshots only capture data that has been written to your EBS volume at
the time the snapshot command is issued; this may exclude any data that
has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can
pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot,
your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file
writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the
instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to
ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your
volume while the snapshot status is \code{pending}.

To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you
should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.

Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically
encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also
automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated
snapshots always remain protected.

You can tag your snapshots during creation. For more information, see

in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide}.
