\description{
AWS Import/Export Service AWS Import/Export accelerates transferring
large amounts of data between the AWS cloud and portable storage devices
that you mail to us. AWS Import/Export transfers data directly onto and
off of your storage devices using Amazon\'s high-speed internal network
and bypassing the Internet. For large data sets, AWS Import/Export is
often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than
upgrading your connectivity.
