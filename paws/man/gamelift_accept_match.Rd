match}
\usage{
gamelift_accept_match(TicketId, PlayerIds, AcceptanceType)
}
\arguments{
\item{TicketId}{[required] A unique identifier for a matchmaking ticket. The ticket must be in
status \code{REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE}; otherwise this request will fail.}

\item{PlayerIds}{[required] A unique identifier for a player delivering the response. This parameter
can include one or multiple player IDs.}

\item{AcceptanceType}{[required] Player response to the proposed match.}
}
\description{
Registers a player\'s acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch
match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so,
then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless
all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.
}
\details{
When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in
the proposed match are placed into status \code{REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE}. This is
a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the
ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this
status; all other acceptances result in an error.

To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or
more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the
matchmaking tickets advance to status \code{PLACING}, where a new game
session is created for the match.

If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received
before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The
matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets
where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is
returned to \code{SEARCHING} to find a new match. For tickets where one or
more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to \code{CANCELLED},
and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these
players can be submitted as needed.
