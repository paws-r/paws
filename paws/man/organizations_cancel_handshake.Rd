\usage{
organizations_cancel_handshake(HandshakeId)
}
\arguments{
\item{HandshakeId}{[required] The unique identifier (ID) of the handshake that you want to cancel. You
can get the ID from the ListHandshakesForOrganization operation.

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} for handshake ID
string requires \"h-\" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or

}
\description{
Cancels a handshake. Canceling a handshake sets the handshake state to
\code{CANCELED}.
}
\details{
This operation can be called only from the account that originated the
handshake. The recipient of the handshake can\'t cancel it, but can use
DeclineHandshake instead. After a handshake is canceled, the recipient
can no longer respond to that handshake.

After you cancel a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of
relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it\'s deleted.
