}
\arguments{
\item{ImageId}{[required] The ID of the AMI.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without

\description{
Deregisters the specified AMI. After you deregister an AMI, it can\'t be
used to launch new instances; however, it doesn\'t affect any instances
that you\'ve already launched from the AMI. You\'ll continue to incur
usage costs for those instances until you terminate them.
}
\details{
When you deregister an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, it doesn\'t affect the
snapshot that was created for the root volume of the instance during the
AMI creation process. When you deregister an instance store-backed AMI,
it doesn\'t affect the files that you uploaded to Amazon S3 when you
created the AMI.
