\title{Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you
can review the changes before executing them}
\usage{
cloudformation_create_change_set(StackName, TemplateBody, TemplateURL,
  UsePreviousTemplate, Parameters, Capabilities, ResourceTypes, RoleARN,
  RollbackConfiguration, NotificationARNs, Tags, ChangeSetName,
  ClientToken, Description, ChangeSetType, ResourcesToImport)
}
\arguments{
\item{StackName}{[required] The name or the unique ID of the stack for which you are creating a
change set. AWS CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing
this stack\'s information with the information that you submit, such as
a modified template or different parameter input values.}

\item{TemplateBody}{A structure that contains the body of the revised template, with a
minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. AWS
CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this template with
the template of the stack that you specified.

Conditional: You must specify only \code{TemplateBody} or \code{TemplateURL}.}

\item{TemplateURL}{The location of the file that contains the revised template. The URL
must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an
S3 bucket. AWS CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this
template with the stack that you specified.

Conditional: You must specify only \code{TemplateBody} or \code{TemplateURL}.}

\item{UsePreviousTemplate}{Whether to reuse the template that is associated with the stack to
create the change set.}

\item{Parameters}{A list of \code{Parameter} structures that specify input parameters for the
change set. For more information, see the Parameter data type.}

\item{Capabilities}{In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create
the stack.
\itemize{
\item \code{CAPABILITY_IAM} and \code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM}

Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS
Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you
must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these
capabilities.

The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
\code{CAPABILITY_IAM} or \code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM} capability.
\itemize{
\item If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
\item If you have IAM resources with custom names, you \emph{must} specify
\code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM}.
\item If you don\'t specify either of these capabilities, AWS
CloudFormation returns an \code{InsufficientCapabilities} error.
}

If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
permissions if necessary.

For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html#capabilities}{Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates}.
\item \code{CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND}

Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from
the processed template, so that they can review the changes
resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If
your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
create a stack directly from the processed template, without first
reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
acknowledge this capability. This includes the
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html}{AWS::Include}
and
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html}{AWS::Serverless}
transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.

This capacity does not apply to creating change sets, and specifying
it when creating change sets has no effect.

Also, change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you
want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros
\emph{and} nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly
from the template using the CreateStack or UpdateStack action, and
specifying this capability.

For more information on macros, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html}{Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates}.
}}

\item{ResourceTypes}{The template resource types that you have permissions to work with if
you execute this change set, such as \verb{AWS::EC2::Instance},
\verb{AWS::EC2::*}, or \code{Custom::MyCustomInstance}.

If the list of resource types doesn\'t include a resource type that
you\'re updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation
grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access
Management (IAM) uses this parameter for condition keys in IAM policies
for AWS CloudFormation. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html}{Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management}
in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.}

\item{RoleARN}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes when executing the change
set. AWS CloudFormation uses the role\'s credentials to make calls on
your behalf. AWS CloudFormation uses this role for all future operations
on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack,
AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don\'t have
permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

If you don\'t specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was
previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS
CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user
credentials.}

\item{RollbackConfiguration}{The rollback triggers for AWS CloudFormation to monitor during stack
creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring
period afterwards.}

\item{NotificationARNs}{The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon Simple Notification Service
(Amazon SNS) topics that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack.
To remove all associated notification topics, specify an empty list.}

\item{Tags}{Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also
propagates these tags to resources in the stack. You can specify a
maximum of 50 tags.}

\item{ChangeSetName}{[required] The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change
sets that are associated with the specified stack.

A change set name can contain only alphanumeric, case sensitive
characters and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and
cannot exceed 128 characters.}

\item{ClientToken}{A unique identifier for this \code{CreateChangeSet} request. Specify this
token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows
that you\'re not attempting to create another change set with the same
name. You might retry \code{CreateChangeSet} requests to ensure that AWS
CloudFormation successfully received them.}

\item{Description}{A description to help you identify this change set.}

\item{ChangeSetType}{The type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new
stack, specify \code{CREATE}. To create a change set for an existing stack,
specify \code{UPDATE}. To create a change set for an import operation,
specify \code{IMPORT}.

If you create a change set for a new stack, AWS Cloudformation creates a
stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or resources. The stack
will be in the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-describing-stacks.html#d0e11995}{\code{REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS}}
state until you execute the change set.

By default, AWS CloudFormation specifies \code{UPDATE}. You can\'t use the
\code{UPDATE} type to create a change set for a new stack or the \code{CREATE}
type to create a change set for an existing stack.}

\item{ResourcesToImport}{The resources to import into your stack.}
}
\description{
Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you
can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change
set for a stack that doesn\'t exist or an existing stack. If you create
a change set for a stack that doesn\'t exist, the change set shows all
of the resources that AWS CloudFormation will create. If you create a
change set for an existing stack, AWS CloudFormation compares the
stack\'s information with the information that you submit in the change
set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which
resources AWS CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will
change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a
stack.
}
\details{
To create a change set for a stack that doesn\'t exist, for the
\code{ChangeSetType} parameter, specify \code{CREATE}. To create a change set for
an existing stack, specify \code{UPDATE} for the \code{ChangeSetType} parameter.
To create a change set for an import operation, specify \code{IMPORT} for the
\code{ChangeSetType} parameter. After the \code{CreateChangeSet} call successfully
completes, AWS CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check
the status of the change set or to review it, use the DescribeChangeSet
action.

When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make,
execute the change set by using the ExecuteChangeSet action. AWS
CloudFormation doesn\'t make changes until you execute the change set.
