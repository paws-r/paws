}

publish the completion status of the celebrity recognition analysis to.}

and identify them in the completion notification.}

\details{
Amazon Rekognition Video can detect celebrities in a video must be
stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Video to specify the bucket name and
the filename of the video. \code{StartCelebrityRecognition} returns a job
identifier (\code{JobId}) which you use to get the results of the analysis.
When celebrity recognition analysis is finished, Amazon Rekognition
Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification
Service topic that you specify in \code{NotificationChannel}. To get the
results of the celebrity recognition analysis, first check that the
status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is \code{SUCCEEDED}. If so,
call GetCelebrityRecognition and pass the job identifier (\code{JobId}) from
the initial call to \code{StartCelebrityRecognition}.

For more information, see Recognizing Celebrities in the Amazon
Rekognition Developer Guide.
