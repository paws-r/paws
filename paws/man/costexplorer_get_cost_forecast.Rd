\title{Retrieves a forecast for how much Amazon Web Services predicts that you
will spend over the forecast time period that you select, based on your
past costs}
\usage{
costexplorer_get_cost_forecast(TimePeriod, Metric, Granularity, Filter,
  PredictionIntervalLevel)
}
\arguments{
\item{TimePeriod}{[required] The period of time that you want the forecast to cover.}

\item{Metric}{[required] Which metric Cost Explorer uses to create your forecast. For more
information about blended and unblended rates, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/blended-rates-intro/}{Why does the \"blended\" annotation appear on some line items in my bill?}.

Valid values for a \code{GetCostForecast} call are the following:
\itemize{
\item AMORTIZED\\_COST
\item BLENDED\\_COST
\item NET\\_AMORTIZED\\_COST
\item NET\\_UNBLENDED\\_COST
\item UNBLENDED\\_COST
}}

\item{Granularity}{[required] How granular you want the forecast to be. You can get 3 months of
\code{DAILY} forecasts or 12 months of \code{MONTHLY} forecasts.

The \code{GetCostForecast} operation supports only \code{DAILY} and \code{MONTHLY}
granularities.}

\item{Filter}{The filters that you want to use to filter your forecast. Cost Explorer
API supports all of the Cost Explorer filters.}

\item{PredictionIntervalLevel}{Cost Explorer always returns the mean forecast as a single point. You
can request a prediction interval around the mean by specifying a
confidence level. The higher the confidence level, the more confident
Cost Explorer is about the actual value falling in the prediction
interval. Higher confidence levels result in wider prediction intervals.}
