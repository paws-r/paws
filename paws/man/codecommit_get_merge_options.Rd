\title{Returns information about the merge options available for merging two
specified branches}
\usage{
codecommit_get_merge_options(repositoryName, sourceCommitSpecifier,
  destinationCommitSpecifier, conflictDetailLevel,
  conflictResolutionStrategy)
}
\arguments{
\item{repositoryName}{[required] The name of the repository that contains the commits about which you
want to get merge options.}

\item{sourceCommitSpecifier}{[required] The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).}

\item{destinationCommitSpecifier}{[required] The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).}

\item{conflictDetailLevel}{The level of conflict detail to use. If unspecified, the default
FILE\\_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
file has differences in both branches. If LINE\\_LEVEL is specified, a
conflict is considered not mergeable if the same file in both branches
has differences on the same line.}

\item{conflictResolutionStrategy}{Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts, or whether to
attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default is
NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before the
merge operation is successful.}
}
