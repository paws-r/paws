\usage{
ssm_create_ops_item(Description, OperationalData, Notifications,
  Priority, RelatedOpsItems, Source, Title, Tags, Category, Severity)
}
\arguments{
\item{Description}{[required] Information about the OpsItem.}

\item{OperationalData}{Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details
about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error
strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data. You
enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum length
of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.

Operational data keys \emph{can\'t} begin with the following: amazon, aws,
amzn, ssm, /amazon, /aws, /amzn, /ssm.

You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the account
or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that all users
with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the
DescribeOpsItems API action) can view and search on the specified data.
Operational data that is not searchable is only viewable by users who
have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the GetOpsItem API action).

Use the \verb{/aws/resources} key in OperationalData to specify a related
resource in the request. Use the \verb{/aws/automations} key in
OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To
view AWS CLI example commands that use these keys, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-creating-OpsItems.html#OpsCenter-manually-create-OpsItems}{Creating OpsItems Manually}
in the \emph{AWS Systems Manager User Guide}.}

\item{Notifications}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an SNS topic where notifications are
sent when this OpsItem is edited or changed.}

\item{Priority}{The importance of this OpsItem in relation to other OpsItems in the
system.}

\item{RelatedOpsItems}{One or more OpsItems that share something in common with the current
OpsItems. For example, related OpsItems can include OpsItems with
similar error messages, impacted resources, or statuses for the impacted
resource.}

\item{Source}{[required] The origin of the OpsItem, such as Amazon EC2 or AWS Systems Manager.}

\item{Title}{[required] A short heading that describes the nature of the OpsItem and the
impacted resource.}

\item{Tags}{Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. You can restrict access
to OpsItems by using an inline IAM policy that specifies tags. For more
information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-getting-started.html#OpsCenter-getting-started-user-permissions}{Getting Started with OpsCenter}
in the \emph{AWS Systems Manager User Guide}.

Tags use a key-value pair. For example:

\verb{Key=Department,Value=Finance}

To add tags to an existing OpsItem, use the AddTagsToResource action.}

\item{Category}{Specify a category to assign to an OpsItem.}

\item{Severity}{Specify a severity to assign to an OpsItem.}
