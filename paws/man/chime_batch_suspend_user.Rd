\description{
Suspends up to 50 users from a \code{Team} or \code{EnterpriseLWA} Amazon Chime
account. For more information about different account types, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/manage-chime-account.html}{Managing Your Amazon Chime Accounts}
in the \emph{Amazon Chime Administration Guide}.
}
\details{
Users suspended from a \code{Team} account are disassociated from the
account, but they can continue to use Amazon Chime as free users. To
remove the suspension from suspended \code{Team} account users, invite them
to the \code{Team} account again. You can use the InviteUsers action to do
so.

Users suspended from an \code{EnterpriseLWA} account are immediately signed
out of Amazon Chime and can no longer sign in. To remove the suspension
from suspended \code{EnterpriseLWA} account users, use the BatchUnsuspendUser
action.

To sign out users without suspending them, use the LogoutUser action.
