\title{Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN)
which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine}
\usage{
sfn_get_activity_task(activityArn, workerName)
}
\arguments{
\item{activityArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the activity to retrieve tasks from
(assigned when you create the task using CreateActivity.)}

\item{workerName}{You can provide an arbitrary name in order to identify the worker that
the task is assigned to. This name is used when it is logged in the
execution history.}
}
\description{
Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN)
which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine. This
initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open
and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a
task of this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on to
the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available
within 60 seconds, the poll returns a \code{taskToken} with a null string.
}
\details{
Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 65
seconds (5 seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold the
poll request).

Polling with \code{GetActivityTask} can cause latency in some
implementations. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/bp-activity-pollers.html}{Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks}
in the Step Functions Developer Guide.
