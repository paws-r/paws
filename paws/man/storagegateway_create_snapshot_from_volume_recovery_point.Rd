\title{Initiates a snapshot of a gateway from a volume recovery point}
\usage{
storagegateway_create_snapshot_from_volume_recovery_point(VolumeARN,
  SnapshotDescription, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{VolumeARN}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the iSCSI volume target. Use the
DescribeStorediSCSIVolumes operation to return to retrieve the TargetARN
for specified VolumeARN.}

\item{SnapshotDescription}{[required] Textual description of the snapshot that appears in the Amazon EC2
console, Elastic Block Store snapshots panel in the \strong{Description}
field, and in the AWS Storage Gateway snapshot \strong{Details} pane,
\strong{Description} field}

\item{Tags}{A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to a snapshot. Each tag is
a key-value pair.

Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers
representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + -
= . \\_ : / @. The maximum length of a tag\'s key is 128 characters, and
the maximum length for a tag\'s value is 256.}

\description{
Initiates a snapshot of a gateway from a volume recovery point. This
operation is only supported in the cached volume gateway type.
}
\details{
A volume recovery point is a point in time at which all data of the
volume is consistent and from which you can create a snapshot. To get a
list of volume recovery point for cached volume gateway, use
ListVolumeRecoveryPoints.

In the \code{CreateSnapshotFromVolumeRecoveryPoint} request, you identify the
volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also
provide a description for the snapshot. When the gateway takes a
snapshot of the specified volume, the snapshot and its description
appear in the AWS Storage Gateway console. In response, the gateway
returns you a snapshot ID. You can use this snapshot ID to check the
snapshot progress or later use it when you want to create a volume from
a snapshot.

To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For more
information, in \emph{Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference}.
