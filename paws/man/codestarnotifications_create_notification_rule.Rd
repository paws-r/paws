}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name for the notification rule. Notifictaion rule names must be
unique in your AWS account.}

\item{EventTypeIds}{[required] A list of event types associated with this notification rule. For a list
of allowed events, see EventTypeSummary.}

\item{DetailType}{[required] The level of detail to include in the notifications for this resource.

by AWS CodeStar Notifications and/or the service for the resource for
which the notification is created.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{A unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided in a
