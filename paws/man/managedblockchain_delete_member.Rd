Deletes a member. Deleting a member removes the member and all
associated resources from the network. \code{DeleteMember} can only be called
for a specified \code{MemberId} if the principal performing the action is
associated with the AWS account that owns the member. In all other
cases, the \code{DeleteMember} action is carried out as the result of an
approved proposal to remove a member. If \code{MemberId} is the last member
in a network specified by the last AWS account, the network is deleted
also.
