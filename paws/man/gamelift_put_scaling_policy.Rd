\usage{
gamelift_put_scaling_policy(Name, FleetId, ScalingAdjustment,
  ScalingAdjustmentType, Threshold, ComparisonOperator, EvaluationPeriods,
  MetricName, PolicyType, TargetConfiguration)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] A descriptive label that is associated with a scaling policy. Policy
names do not need to be unique. A fleet can have only one scaling policy
with the same name.}

\item{FleetId}{[required] A unique identifier for a fleet to apply this policy to. You can use
either the fleet ID or ARN value. The fleet cannot be in any of the
following statuses: ERROR or DELETING.}

\item{ScalingAdjustment}{Amount of adjustment to make, based on the scaling adjustment type.}

\item{ScalingAdjustmentType}{The type of adjustment to make to a fleet\'s instance count (see
FleetCapacity):
\itemize{
\item \strong{ChangeInCapacity} \\-- add (or subtract) the scaling adjustment
value from the current instance count. Positive values scale up
while negative values scale down.
\item \strong{ExactCapacity} \\-- set the instance count to the scaling
adjustment value.
\item \strong{PercentChangeInCapacity} \\-- increase or reduce the current
instance count by the scaling adjustment, read as a percentage.
Positive values scale up while negative values scale down; for
example, a value of \"-10\" scales the fleet down by 10\%.
}}

\item{Threshold}{Metric value used to trigger a scaling event.}

\item{ComparisonOperator}{Comparison operator to use when measuring the metric against the
threshold value.}

\item{EvaluationPeriods}{Length of time (in minutes) the metric must be at or beyond the
threshold before a scaling event is triggered.}

\item{MetricName}{[required] Name of the Amazon GameLift-defined metric that is used to trigger a
scaling adjustment. For detailed descriptions of fleet metrics, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html}{Monitor Amazon GameLift with Amazon CloudWatch}.
\itemize{
\item \strong{ActivatingGameSessions} \\-- Game sessions in the process of being
created.
\item \strong{ActiveGameSessions} \\-- Game sessions that are currently running.
\item \strong{ActiveInstances} \\-- Fleet instances that are currently running
at least one game session.
\item \strong{AvailableGameSessions} \\-- Additional game sessions that fleet
could host simultaneously, given current capacity.
\item \strong{AvailablePlayerSessions} \\-- Empty player slots in currently
active game sessions. This includes game sessions that are not
currently accepting players. Reserved player slots are not included.
\item \strong{CurrentPlayerSessions} \\-- Player slots in active game sessions
that are being used by a player or are reserved for a player.
\item \strong{IdleInstances} \\-- Active instances that are currently hosting
zero game sessions.
\item \strong{PercentAvailableGameSessions} \\-- Unused percentage of the total
number of game sessions that a fleet could host simultaneously,
given current capacity. Use this metric for a target-based scaling
policy.
\item \strong{PercentIdleInstances} \\-- Percentage of the total number of
active instances that are hosting zero game sessions.
\item \strong{QueueDepth} \\-- Pending game session placement requests, in any
queue, where the current fleet is the top-priority destination.
\item \strong{WaitTime} \\-- Current wait time for pending game session
placement requests, in any queue, where the current fleet is the
top-priority destination.

\item{PolicyType}{The type of scaling policy to create. For a target-based policy, set the
parameter \emph{MetricName} to \'PercentAvailableGameSessions\' and specify a
\emph{TargetConfiguration}. For a rule-based policy set the following
parameters: \emph{MetricName}, \emph{ComparisonOperator}, \emph{Threshold},
\emph{EvaluationPeriods}, \emph{ScalingAdjustmentType}, and \emph{ScalingAdjustment}.}

\item{TargetConfiguration}{The settings for a target-based scaling policy.}

\description{
Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are
used to automatically scale a fleet\'s hosting capacity to meet player
demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a
fleet metric and automatically change the fleet\'s capacity when a
certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies:
target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and
efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used.
Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over
auto-scaling.
}
\details{
Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the
same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple
rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however,
because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.

You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling
StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO\\_SCALING. To resume scaling
policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet action. To stop
just one scaling policy\\--or to permanently remove it, you must delete
the policy with DeleteScalingPolicy.

Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html}{Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling}.

\strong{Target-based policy}

A target-based policy tracks a single metric:
PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a
fleet\'s hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not
currently in use. This is the fleet\'s buffer; it measures the
additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current
capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and
leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to
maintain that target.

For example, you might choose to maintain a 10\% buffer for a fleet that
has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy
tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet\'s available
capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift
will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to
the 10\% buffer.

To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name,
and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track
(PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration
object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On
a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is
automatically in force as soon as it\'s successfully created. If the
fleet\'s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy
will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

\strong{Rule-based policy}

A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold
value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With
a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet
metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by
how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.

For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the
percentage of idle instances is greater than 20\% for more than 15
minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10\%.\"

A policy\'s rule statement has the following structure:

If \verb{\\\[MetricName\\\]} is \verb{\\\[ComparisonOperator\\\]} \verb{\\\[Threshold\\\]}
for \verb{\\\[EvaluationPeriods\\\]} minutes, then
\verb{\\\[ScalingAdjustmentType\\\]} to/by \verb{\\\[ScalingAdjustment\\\]}.

To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:

If \verb{\\\[PercentIdleInstances\\\]} is \verb{\\\[GreaterThanThreshold\\\]}
\verb{\\\[20\\\]} for \verb{\\\[15\\\]} minutes, then \verb{\\\[PercentChangeInCapacity\\\]}
to/by \verb{\\\[10\\\]}.

To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of
name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the
parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request,
the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force
as soon as they\'re successfully created. If the fleet\'s auto-scaling
actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once
the fleet actions are restarted.
