\title{Retrieves settings for one or more trails associated with the current
region for your account}
\usage{
cloudtrail_describe_trails(trailNameList, includeShadowTrails)
}
\arguments{
\item{trailNameList}{Specifies a list of trail names, trail ARNs, or both, of the trails to
describe. The format of a trail ARN is:

\code{arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail}

If an empty list is specified, information for the trail in the current
region is returned.
\itemize{
\item If an empty list is specified and \code{IncludeShadowTrails} is false,
then information for all trails in the current region is returned.
\item If an empty list is specified and IncludeShadowTrails is null or
true, then information for all trails in the current region and any
associated shadow trails in other regions is returned.
}

If one or more trail names are specified, information is returned only
if the names match the names of trails belonging only to the current
region. To return information about a trail in another region, you must
specify its trail ARN.}

\item{includeShadowTrails}{Specifies whether to include shadow trails in the response. A shadow
trail is the replication in a region of a trail that was created in a
different region, or in the case of an organization trail, the
replication of an organization trail in member accounts. If you do not
include shadow trails, organization trails in a member account and
region replication trails will not be returned. The default is true.}
