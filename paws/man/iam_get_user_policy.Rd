\description{
Retrieves the specified inline policy document that is embedded in the
specified IAM user.
}
\details{
Policies returned by this API are URL-encoded compliant with \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986}{RFC 3986}. You can use a URL decoding
method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if
you use Java, you can use the \code{decode} method of the
\code{java.net.URLDecoder} utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and
SDKs provide similar functionality.

An IAM user can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a
managed policy document that is attached to a user, use GetPolicy to
determine the policy\'s default version. Then use GetPolicyVersion to
retrieve the policy document.

For more information about policies, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html}{Managed Policies and Inline Policies}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.
