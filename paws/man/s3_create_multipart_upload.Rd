\description{
This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID.
This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific
multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent
upload part requests (see UploadPart). You also include this upload ID
in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload
request.
}
\details{
For more information about multipart uploads, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html}{Multipart Upload Overview}.

If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart
uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in
the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart
upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and Amazon S3 aborts the
multipart upload. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config}{Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy}.

For information about the permissions required to use the multipart
upload API, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html}{Multipart Upload API and Permissions}.

For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular
requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to
upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign
each request individually. There is nothing special about signing
multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html}{Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)}.

After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to
stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either
complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space
used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only
after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.

You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side
encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your
own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer
master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose
to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in
UploadPart) and UploadPartCopy) requests must match the headers you used
in the request to initiate the upload by using \code{CreateMultipartUpload}.

To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the
requester must have permission to the \code{kms:Encrypt}, \code{kms:Decrypt},
\verb{kms:ReEncrypt*}, \verb{kms:GenerateDataKey*}, and \code{kms:DescribeKey} actions
on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must
decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes
the multipart upload.

If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the
same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these
permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a
different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on
both the key policy and your IAM user or role.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html}{Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption}.

Access Permissions

:   When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or
groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new
object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the
request headers:\preformatted{-   Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. For
    more information, see [Canned
    ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).

-   Specify access permissions explicitly with the
    `x-amz-grant-read`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`,
    `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers.
    These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3
    supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control
    List (ACL)
    Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).

You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
explicitly. You cannot do both.
}

Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

:   You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using
server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data
encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to
disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The
option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed
encryption keys or provide your own encryption key.\preformatted{-   Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys
    (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) -- If you
    want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the
    following headers in the request.

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryption

    -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

    -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

    If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but
    don\\'t provide `x-amz-server-side- encryption-aws-kms-key-id`,
    Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the
    data.

    All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail
    if you don\\'t make them with SSL or by using SigV4.

    For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs
    stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using
    Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
    KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).

-   Use customer-provided encryption keys -- If you want to manage
    your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in
    the request.

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-algorithm

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key-MD5

    For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs
    stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using
    Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
    KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).
}

Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

:   You also can use the following access control--related headers with
this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner
has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant
permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups
defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access
control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html}{Using ACLs}.
With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of
the following two methods:\preformatted{-   Specify a canned ACL (`x-amz-acl`) --- Amazon S3 supports a set
    of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each canned ACL has
    a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more
    information, see [Canned
    ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).

-   Specify access permissions explicitly --- To explicitly grant
    access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the
    following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that
    Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access
    Control List (ACL)
    Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).
    In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the
    specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:

    -   x-amz-grant-read

    -   x-amz-grant-write

    -   x-amz-grant-read-acp

    -   x-amz-grant-write-acp

    -   x-amz-grant-full-control

    You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is
    one of the following:

    -   `emailAddress` -- if the value specified is the email
        address of an AWS account

    -   `id` -- if the value specified is the canonical user ID of
        an AWS account

    -   `uri` -- if you are granting permissions to a predefined
        group

    For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants the
    AWS accounts identified by email addresses permissions to read
    object data and its metadata:

    `x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" `
}
