\title{Creates one or more virtual tapes}
\usage{
storagegateway_create_tapes(GatewayARN, TapeSizeInBytes, ClientToken,
  NumTapesToCreate, TapeBarcodePrefix, KMSEncrypted, KMSKey, PoolId, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{GatewayARN}{[required] The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that represents the gateway to
associate the virtual tapes with. Use the ListGateways operation to
return a list of gateways for your account and AWS Region.}

\item{TapeSizeInBytes}{[required] The size, in bytes, of the virtual tapes that you want to create.

The size must be aligned by gigabyte (1024\emph{1024}1024 byte).}

\item{ClientToken}{[required] A unique identifier that you use to retry a request. If you retry a
request, use the same \code{ClientToken} you specified in the initial
request.

Using the same \code{ClientToken} prevents creating the tape multiple times.}

\item{NumTapesToCreate}{[required] The number of virtual tapes that you want to create.}

\item{TapeBarcodePrefix}{[required] A prefix that you append to the barcode of the virtual tape you are
creating. This prefix makes the barcode unique.

The prefix must be 1 to 4 characters in length and must be one of the
uppercase letters from A to Z.}

\item{KMSEncrypted}{True to use Amazon S3 server side encryption with your own AWS KMS key,
or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.}

\item{KMSKey}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS KMS key used for Amazon S3
server side encryption. This value can only be set when KMSEncrypted is
true. Optional.}

\item{PoolId}{The ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for archiving. The
tape in this pool is archived in the S3 storage class that is associated
with the pool. When you use your backup application to eject the tape,
the tape is archived directly into the storage class (Glacier or Deep
Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

Valid values: \"GLACIER\", \"DEEP\\_ARCHIVE\"}

\item{Tags}{A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to a virtual tape. Each tag
is a key-value pair.

Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers
representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + -
= . \\_ : / @. The maximum length of a tag\'s key is 128 characters, and
the maximum length for a tag\'s value is 256.}
}
\description{
Creates one or more virtual tapes. You write data to the virtual tapes
and then archive the tapes. This operation is only supported in the tape
gateway type.
}
\details{
Cache storage must be allocated to the gateway before you can create
virtual tapes. Use the AddCache operation to add cache storage to a
gateway.
