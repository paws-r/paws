Provides organization config rule deployment status for an organization.
}
\details{
The status is not considered successful until organization config rule
is successfully deployed in all the member accounts with an exception of
excluded accounts.

When you specify the limit and the next token, you receive a paginated
response. Limit and next token are not applicable if you specify
organization config rule names. It is only applicable, when you request
all the organization config rules.

Only a master account can call this API.
