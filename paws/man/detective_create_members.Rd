\description{
Amazon Detective is currently in preview.
}
\details{
Sends a request to invite the specified AWS accounts to be member
accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the
master account for a behavior graph.

\code{CreateMembers} verifies the accounts and then sends invitations to the
verified accounts.

The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to
invite.

The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:
\itemize{
\item The accounts that \code{CreateMembers} was able to start the verification
for. This list includes member accounts that are being verified,
that have passed verification and are being sent an invitation, and
that have failed verification.
\item The accounts that \code{CreateMembers} was unable to process. This list
includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in
the behavior graph.
}
