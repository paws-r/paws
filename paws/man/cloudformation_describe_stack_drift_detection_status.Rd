\title{Returns information about a stack drift detection operation}
\usage{
cloudformation_describe_stack_drift_detection_status(
  StackDriftDetectionId)
}
\arguments{
\item{StackDriftDetectionId}{[required] The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

AWS CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID,
each time this operation is run. However, the number of drift results
AWS CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for how long, may
vary.}
}
\description{
Returns information about a stack drift detection operation. A stack
drift detection operation detects whether a stack\'s actual
configuration differs, or has \emph{drifted}, from it\'s expected
configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified
as template parameters. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or
more of its resources have drifted. For more information on stack and
resource drift, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html}{Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources}.
}
\details{
Use DetectStackDrift to initiate a stack drift detection operation.
\code{DetectStackDrift} returns a \code{StackDriftDetectionId} you can use to
monitor the progress of the operation using
\code{DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus}. Once the drift detection operation
has completed, use DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift
information about the stack and its resources.
