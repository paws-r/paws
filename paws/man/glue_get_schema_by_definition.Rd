\usage{
glue_get_schema_by_definition(SchemaId, SchemaDefinition)
}
\arguments{
\item{SchemaId}{[required] This is a wrapper structure to contain schema identity fields. The
structure contains:
\itemize{
\item SchemaId$SchemaArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema.
One of \code{SchemaArn} or \code{SchemaName} has to be provided.
\item SchemaId$SchemaName: The name of the schema. One of \code{SchemaArn} or
\code{SchemaName} has to be provided.
}}

\item{SchemaDefinition}{[required] The definition of the schema for which schema details are required.}
}
\description{
Retrieves a schema by the \code{SchemaDefinition}. The schema definition is
sent to the Schema Registry, canonicalized, and hashed. If the hash is
matched within the scope of the \code{SchemaName} or ARN (or the default
registry, if none is supplied), that schemaâ€™s metadata is returned.
Otherwise, a 404 or NotFound error is returned. Schema versions in
\code{Deleted} statuses will not be included in the results.
