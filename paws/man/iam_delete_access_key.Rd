}
\arguments{
\item{UserName}{The name of the user whose access key pair you want to delete.

This parameter allows (through its \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern}) a string of characters
consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: \\_+=,.@-}

\item{AccessKeyId}{[required] The access key ID for the access key ID and secret access key you want

}
\description{
Deletes the access key pair associated with the specified IAM user.
}
\details{
If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name
implicitly based on the AWS access key ID signing the request. This
operation works for access keys under the AWS account. Consequently, you
can use this operation to manage AWS account root user credentials even
if the AWS account has no associated users.
