\usage{
ses_send_bulk_templated_email(Source, SourceArn, ReplyToAddresses,
  ReturnPath, ReturnPathArn, ConfigurationSetName, DefaultTags, Template,
  TemplateArn, DefaultTemplateData, Destinations)
}
\arguments{
\item{Source}{[required] The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be
either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has
been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying
identities, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html}{Amazon SES Developer Guide}.

If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to
do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the
\code{SourceArn} parameter. For more information about sending authorization,
see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html}{Amazon SES Developer Guide}.

Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in
RFC6531. For this reason, the \emph{local part} of a source email address
(the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only
contain \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part}{7-bit ASCII characters}. If
the \emph{domain part} of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains
non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described
in \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492.html}{RFC3492}. The sender name
(also known as the \emph{friendly name}) may contain non-ASCII characters.
These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as
described in \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047}{RFC 2047}. MIME
encoded-word syntax uses the following form:
\verb{=?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=}.}

\item{SourceArn}{This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of
the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy
that permits you to send for the email address specified in the \code{Source}
parameter.

For example, if the owner of \code{example.com} (which has ARN
\code{arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com}) attaches a
policy to it that authorizes you to send from \code{user@example.com}, then
you would specify the \code{SourceArn} to be
\code{arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com}, and the
\code{Source} to be \code{user@example.com}.

For more information about sending authorization, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html}{Amazon SES Developer Guide}.}

\item{ReplyToAddresses}{The reply-to email address(es) for the message. If the recipient replies
to the message, each reply-to address will receive the reply.}

\item{ReturnPath}{The email address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to when
feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered to
the recipient, then an error message will be returned from the
recipient\'s ISP; this message will then be forwarded to the email
address specified by the \code{ReturnPath} parameter. The \code{ReturnPath}
parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either
individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been
verified with Amazon SES.}

\item{ReturnPathArn}{This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of
the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy
that permits you to use the email address specified in the \code{ReturnPath}
parameter.

For example, if the owner of \code{example.com} (which has ARN
\code{arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com}) attaches a
policy to it that authorizes you to use \code{feedback@example.com}, then you
would specify the \code{ReturnPathArn} to be
\code{arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com}, and the
\code{ReturnPath} to be \code{feedback@example.com}.

For more information about sending authorization, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html}{Amazon SES Developer Guide}.}

\item{ConfigurationSetName}{The name of the configuration set to use when you send an email using
\code{SendBulkTemplatedEmail}.}

\item{DefaultTags}{A list of tags, in the form of name/value pairs, to apply to an email
that you send to a destination using \code{SendBulkTemplatedEmail}.}

\item{Template}{[required] The template to use when sending this email.}

\item{TemplateArn}{The ARN of the template to use when sending this email.}

\item{DefaultTemplateData}{A list of replacement values to apply to the template when replacement
data is not specified in a Destination object. These values act as a
default or fallback option when no other data is available.

The template data is a JSON object, typically consisting of key-value
pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags in the email
template.}

\item{Destinations}{[required] One or more \code{Destination} objects. All of the recipients in a
\code{Destination} will receive the same version of the email. You can
specify up to 50 \code{Destination} objects within a \code{Destinations} array.}

\description{
Composes an email message to multiple destinations. The message body is
created using an email template.
}
\details{
In order to send email using the \code{SendBulkTemplatedEmail} operation,
your call to the API must meet the following requirements:
\itemize{
\item The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create
email templates using the CreateTemplate operation.
\item The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.
\item If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only
send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses
associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html}{Verifying Email Addresses and Domains}
in the \emph{Amazon SES Developer Guide.}
\item The maximum message size is 10 MB.
\item Each \code{Destination} parameter must include at least one recipient
email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC:
address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid
(that is, it is not in the format
\emph{UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain}), the entire message
will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that
are valid.
\item The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:,
CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a
larger audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of
50 or fewer, and then call the \code{SendBulkTemplatedEmail} operation
several times to send the message to each group.
\item The number of destinations you can contact in a single call to the
API may be limited by your account\'s maximum sending rate.
