AWS Health

The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health
information that is presented in the \href{https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/}{AWS Personal Health Dashboard}. You can get
information about events that affect your AWS resources:
\itemize{
\item DescribeEvents: Summary information about events.
\item DescribeEventDetails: Detailed information about one or more events.
\item DescribeAffectedEntities: Information about AWS resources that are
affected by one or more events.
}

In addition, these operations provide information about event types and
summary counts of events or affected entities:
\itemize{
\item DescribeEventTypes: Information about the kinds of events that AWS
Health tracks.
\item DescribeEventAggregates: A count of the number of events that meet
specified criteria.
\item DescribeEntityAggregates: A count of the number of affected entities
that meet specified criteria.
}

AWS Health integrates with AWS Organizations to provide a centralized
view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization.
\itemize{
\item DescribeEventsForOrganization: Summary information about events
across the organization.
\item DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization: List of accounts in your
organization impacted by an event.
\item DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization: Detailed information about
events in your organization.
\item DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization: Information about AWS
resources in your organization that are affected by events.
}

You can use the following operations to enable or disable AWS Health
from working with AWS Organizations.
\itemize{
\item EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization: Enables AWS Health to work
with AWS Organizations.
\item DisableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization: Disables AWS Health from
working with AWS Organizations.
\item DescribeHealthServiceStatusForOrganization: Status information about
enabling or disabling AWS Health from working with AWS
Organizations.
}

The Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from \href{http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/}{AWS Support}. Calling the Health API
from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan
causes a \code{SubscriptionRequiredException}.

For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html}{Signature Version 4 Signing Process}.

See the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html}{AWS Health User Guide}
for information about how to use the API.

\strong{Service Endpoint}

The HTTP endpoint for the AWS Health API is:
\itemize{
\item https://health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
}
}
