\usage{
elasticache_delete_global_replication_group(GlobalReplicationGroupId,
  RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup)
}
\arguments{
\item{GlobalReplicationGroupId}{[required] The name of the Global Datastore}

\item{RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup}{[required] The primary replication group is retained as a standalone replication
group.}
}
\description{
Deleting a Global Datastore is a two-step process:
\itemize{
\item First, you must DisassociateGlobalReplicationGroup to remove the
secondary clusters in the Global Datastore.
\item Once the Global Datastore contains only the primary cluster, you can
use DeleteGlobalReplicationGroup API to delete the Global Datastore
while retainining the primary cluster using Retainâ€¦= true.
}

Since the Global Datastore has only a primary cluster, you can delete
the Global Datastore while retaining the primary by setting
\code{RetainPrimaryCluster=true}.

When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon
ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the selected resources; you
cannot cancel or revert this operation.
