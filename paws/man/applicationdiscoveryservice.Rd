\description{
AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration
projects by automatically identifying servers, virtual machines (VMs),
software, and software dependencies running in your on-premises data
centers. Application Discovery Service also collects application
performance data, which can help you assess the outcome of your
migration. The data collected by Application Discovery Service is
securely retained in an AWS-hosted and managed database in the cloud.
You can export the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred
visualization tool or cloud-migration solution to plan your migration.
For more information, see \href{http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/}{AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ}.

Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Agentless discovery} mode is recommended for environments that
use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn\'t require you to install
an agent on each host. Agentless discovery gathers server
information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the
time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment.
Agentless discovery doesn\'t collect information about software and
software dependencies. It also doesn\'t work in non-VMware
environments.
\item \strong{Agent-based discovery} mode collects a richer set of data than
agentless discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent,
which you install on one or more hosts in your data center. The
agent captures infrastructure and application information, including
an inventory of installed software applications, system and process
performance, resource utilization, and network dependencies between
workloads. The information collected by agents is secured at rest
and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the
cloud.
}

We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware
environments and to collect information about software and software
dependencies. You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery
simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to quickly complete the initial
infrastructure assessment and then install agents on select hosts.

Application Discovery Service integrates with application discovery
solutions from AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. Third-party
application discovery tools can query Application Discovery Service and
write to the Application Discovery Service database using a public API.
You can then import the data into either a visualization tool or
cloud-migration solution.

Application Discovery Service doesn\'t gather sensitive information. All
data is handled according to the \href{http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/}{AWS Privacy Policy}. You can operate Application
Discovery Service offline to inspect collected data before it is shared
with the service.

This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for
each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service.
The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the
response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an
API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that
you\'re using. For more information, see \href{http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs}{AWS SDKs}.

This guide is intended for use with the \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/}{\emph{AWS Application Discovery Service User Guide}}
.

Remember that you must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before you
call any of these APIs, or a \code{HomeRegionNotSetException} error will be
returned. Also, you must make the API calls while in your home region.
