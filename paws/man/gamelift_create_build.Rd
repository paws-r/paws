\title{Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary
files}
\usage{
gamelift_create_build(Name, Version, StorageLocation, OperatingSystem,
  Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{A descriptive label that is associated with a build. Build names do not
need to be unique. You can use UpdateBuild to change this value later.}

\item{Version}{Version information that is associated with a build or script. Version
strings do not need to be unique. You can use UpdateBuild to change this
value later.}

\item{StorageLocation}{Information indicating where your game build files are stored. Use this
parameter only when creating a build with files stored in an S3 bucket
that you own. The storage location must specify an S3 bucket name and
key. The location must also specify a role ARN that you set up to allow
Amazon GameLift to access your S3 bucket. The S3 bucket and your new
build must be in the same Region.}

\item{OperatingSystem}{The operating system that the game server binaries are built to run on.
This value determines the type of fleet resources that you can use for
this build. If your game build contains multiple executables, they all
must run on the same operating system. If an operating system is not
specified when creating a build, Amazon GameLift uses the default value
(WINDOWS\\_2012). This value cannot be changed later.}

\item{Tags}{A list of labels to assign to the new build resource. Tags are
developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for
resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html}{Tagging AWS Resources}
in the \emph{AWS General Reference}. Once the resource is created, you can
use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove,
and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the
AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.}

Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary
files. Game server binaries must be combined into a zip file for use
with Amazon GameLift.

\details{
When setting up a new game build for GameLift, we recommend using the
AWS CLI command
\strong{\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html}{upload-build}}
. This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build
files from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it
creates a new build resource.

The \code{CreateBuild} operation can used in the following scenarios:
\itemize{
\item To create a new game build with build files that are in an S3
location under an AWS account that you control. To use this option,
you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the S3 bucket. With
permissions in place, call \code{CreateBuild} and specify a build name,
operating system, and the S3 storage location of your game build.
\item To directly upload your build files to a GameLift S3 location. To
use this option, first call \code{CreateBuild} and specify a build name
and operating system. This action creates a new build resource and
also returns an S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use
the credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified
S3 location. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html}{Uploading Objects}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Developer Guide}. Build files can be uploaded to
the GameLift S3 location once only; that can\'t be updated.
}

If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique
build ID and places it in \code{INITIALIZED} status. A build must be in
\code{READY} status before you can create fleets with it.
