\usage{
wafv2_list_web_ac_ls(Scope, NextMarker, Limit)
}
\arguments{
\item{Scope}{[required] Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a
regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load
Balancer (ALB) or an API Gateway stage.

To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N.
Virginia) as follows:
\itemize{
\item CLI - Specify the region when you use the CloudFront scope:
\code{--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1}.
\item API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
}}

\item{NextMarker}{When you request a list of objects with a \code{Limit} setting, if the number
of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the limit, AWS
WAF returns a \code{NextMarker} value in the response. To retrieve the next
batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in your next
request.}

\item{Limit}{The maximum number of objects that you want AWS WAF to return for this
request. If more objects are available, in the response, AWS WAF
provides a \code{NextMarker} value that you can use in a subsequent call to
get the next batch of objects.}
