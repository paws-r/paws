\title{Changes the password of the IAM user who is calling this operation}
\usage{
iam_change_password(OldPassword, NewPassword)
}
\arguments{
\item{OldPassword}{[required] The IAM user\'s current password.}

\item{NewPassword}{[required] The new password. The new password must conform to the AWS account\'s
password policy, if one exists.

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} that is used to
validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can
include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (\code{U+0020})
through the end of the ASCII character range (\verb{U+00FF}). You can also
include the tab (\code{U+0009}), line feed (\verb{U+000A}), and carriage return
(\verb{U+000D}) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password.
However, many tools, such as the AWS Management Console, might restrict
the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning
within that tool.}
