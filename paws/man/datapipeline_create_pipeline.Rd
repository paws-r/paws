\title{Creates a new, empty pipeline}
\usage{
datapipeline_create_pipeline(name, uniqueId, description, tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] The name for the pipeline. You can use the same name for multiple
pipelines associated with your AWS account, because AWS Data Pipeline
assigns each pipeline a unique pipeline identifier.}

\item{uniqueId}{[required] A unique identifier. This identifier is not the same as the pipeline
identifier assigned by AWS Data Pipeline. You are responsible for
defining the format and ensuring the uniqueness of this identifier. You
use this parameter to ensure idempotency during repeated calls to
\code{CreatePipeline}. For example, if the first call to \code{CreatePipeline}
does not succeed, you can pass in the same unique identifier and
pipeline name combination on a subsequent call to \code{CreatePipeline}.
\code{CreatePipeline} ensures that if a pipeline already exists with the same
name and unique identifier, a new pipeline is not created. Instead,
you\'ll receive the pipeline identifier from the previous attempt. The
uniqueness of the name and unique identifier combination is scoped to
the AWS account or IAM user credentials.}

\item{description}{The description for the pipeline.}

\item{tags}{A list of tags to associate with the pipeline at creation. Tags let you
control access to pipelines. For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-control-access.html}{Controlling User Access to Pipelines}
in the \emph{AWS Data Pipeline Developer Guide}.}

Creates a new, empty pipeline. Use PutPipelineDefinition to populate the
pipeline.
