\title{Uploads segment documents to AWS X-Ray}
\usage{
xray_put_trace_segments(TraceSegmentDocuments)
}
\arguments{
\item{TraceSegmentDocuments}{[required] A string containing a JSON document defining one or more segments or
subsegments.}
}
\description{
Uploads segment documents to AWS X-Ray. The \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/index.html}{X-Ray SDK} generates segment
documents and sends them to the X-Ray daemon, which uploads them in
batches. A segment document can be a completed segment, an in-progress
segment, or an array of subsegments.
}
\details{
Segments must include the following fields. For the full segment
document schema, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html}{AWS X-Ray Segment Documents}
in the \emph{AWS X-Ray Developer Guide}.

\strong{Required Segment Document Fields}
\itemize{
\item \code{name} - The name of the service that handled the request.
\item \code{id} - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments in
the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.
\item \code{trace_id} - A unique identifier that connects all segments and
subsegments originating from a single client request.
\item \code{start_time} - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in
floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds. For
example, \code{1480615200.010} or \code{1.480615200010E9}.
\item \code{end_time} - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For example,
\code{1480615200.090} or \code{1.480615200090E9}. Specify either an \code{end_time}
or \code{in_progress}.
\item \code{in_progress} - Set to \code{true} instead of specifying an \code{end_time} to
record that a segment has been started, but is not complete. Send an
in progress segment when your application receives a request that
will take a long time to serve, to trace the fact that the request
was received. When the response is sent, send the complete segment
to overwrite the in-progress segment.
}

A \code{trace_id} consists of three numbers separated by hyphens. For
example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. This includes:

\strong{Trace ID Format}
\itemize{
\item The version number, i.e. \code{1}.
\item The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8
hexadecimal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in
epoch time is \code{1480615200} seconds, or \code{58406520} in hexadecimal.
\item A 96-bit identifier for the trace, globally unique, in 24
hexadecimal digits.
