\usage{
comprehend_delete_entity_recognizer(EntityRecognizerArn)
}
\arguments{
\item{EntityRecognizerArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the entity recognizer.}
}
\description{
Deletes an entity recognizer.
}
\details{
Only those recognizers that are in terminated states (IN\\_ERROR,
TRAINED) will be deleted. If an active inference job is using the model,
a \code{ResourceInUseException} will be returned.

This is an asynchronous action that puts the recognizer into a DELETING
state, and it is then removed by a background job. Once removed, the
recognizer disappears from your account and is no longer available for
use.
