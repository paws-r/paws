\title{Stops the canary to prevent all future runs}
\usage{
synthetics_stop_canary(Name)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name of the canary that you want to stop. To find the names of your
canaries, use \code{\link[=synthetics_describe_canaries]{describe_canaries}}.}
}
\description{
Stops the canary to prevent all future runs. If the canary is currently
running, Synthetics stops waiting for the current run of the specified
canary to complete. The run that is in progress completes on its own,
publishes metrics, and uploads artifacts, but it is not recorded in
Synthetics as a completed run.

You can use \code{\link[=synthetics_start_canary]{start_canary}} to start it
running again with the canaryâ€™s current schedule at any point in the
future.
