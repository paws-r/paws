\title{Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file
system}
\usage{
fsx_create_backup(FileSystemId, ClientRequestToken, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{FileSystemId}{[required] The ID of the file system to back up.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{(Optional) A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to
ensure idempotent creation. This string is automatically filled on your
behalf when you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or an AWS
SDK.}

\item{Tags}{The tags to apply to the backup at backup creation. The key value of the
\code{Name} tag appears in the console as the backup name.}
}
\description{
Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file
system. Creating regular backups for your file system is a best practice
that complements the replication that Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
performs for your file system. It also enables you to restore from user
modification of data.
}
\details{
If a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the
parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing
backup. If a backup specified client request token exists, and the
parameters don\'t match, this operation returns
\code{IncompatibleParameterError}. If a backup with the specified client
request token doesn\'t exist, \code{CreateBackup} does the following:
\itemize{
\item Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial
lifecycle state of \code{CREATING}.
\item Returns the description of the backup.
}

By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a \code{CreateBackup}
operation without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach
can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear
whether a backup was created. If you use the same client request token
and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a
successful result because all the parameters are the same.

The \code{CreateFileSystem} operation returns while the backup\'s lifecycle
state is still \code{CREATING}. You can check the file system creation status
by calling the DescribeBackups operation, which returns the backup state
along with other information.
