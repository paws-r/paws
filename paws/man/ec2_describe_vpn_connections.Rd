\itemize{
\item \code{customer-gateway-configuration} - The configuration information for
the customer gateway.
\item \code{customer-gateway-id} - The ID of a customer gateway associated with
the VPN connection.
\item \code{state} - The state of the VPN connection (\code{pending} \\| \code{available}

with the key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for
the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{type} - The type of VPN connection. Currently the only supported
