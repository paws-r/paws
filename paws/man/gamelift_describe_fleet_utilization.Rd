\title{Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets}
\usage{
gamelift_describe_fleet_utilization(FleetIds, Limit, NextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetIds}{A unique identifier for a fleet(s) to retrieve utilization data for. You
can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.}

\item{Limit}{The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with
\code{NextToken} to get results as a set of sequential pages. This parameter
is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.}

\item{NextToken}{Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results.
Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To
start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value. This
parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet
IDs.}
}
\description{
Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets. You can request
utilization data for all fleets, or specify a list of one or more fleet
IDs. When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to
retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a
FleetUtilization object is returned for each requested fleet ID. When
specifying a list of fleet IDs, utilization objects are returned only
for fleets that currently exist.
}
\details{
Some API actions may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one
request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the
error message includes the maximum allowed.
