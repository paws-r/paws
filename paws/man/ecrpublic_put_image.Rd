\item{imageManifestMediaType}{The media type of the image manifest. If you push an image manifest that

\item{imageTag}{The tag to associate with the image. This parameter is required for

\description{
Creates or updates the image manifest and tags associated with an image.

When an image is pushed and all new image layers have been uploaded, the
PutImage API is called once to create or update the image manifest and
the tags associated with the image.

This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used
by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should
use the \code{docker} CLI to pull, tag, and push images.
