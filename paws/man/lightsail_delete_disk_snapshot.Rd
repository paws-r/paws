\title{Deletes the specified disk snapshot}
\usage{
lightsail_delete_disk_snapshot(diskSnapshotName)
}
\arguments{
\item{diskSnapshotName}{[required] The name of the disk snapshot you want to delete (e.g.,
\code{my-disk-snapshot}).}
}
\description{
Deletes the specified disk snapshot.
}
\details{
When you make periodic snapshots of a disk, the snapshots are
incremental, and only the blocks on the device that have changed since
your last snapshot are saved in the new snapshot. When you delete a
snapshot, only the data not needed for any other snapshot is removed. So
regardless of which prior snapshots have been deleted, all active
snapshots will have access to all the information needed to restore the
disk.

The \verb{delete disk snapshot} operation supports tag-based access control
via resource tags applied to the resource identified by
\verb{disk snapshot name}. For more information, see the \href{https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags}{Lightsail Dev Guide}.
