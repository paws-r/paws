\description{
Initiates a stop request for the current test run. AWS Device Farm
immediately stops the run on devices where tests have not started. You
are not billed for these devices. On devices where tests have started
executing, setup suite and teardown suite tests run to completion on
those devices. You are billed for setup, teardown, and any tests that
were in progress or already completed.
