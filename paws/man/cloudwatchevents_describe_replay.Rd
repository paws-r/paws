\description{
Retrieves details about a replay. Use \code{DescribeReplay} to determine the
progress of a running replay. A replay processes events to replay based
on the time in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If
you use \code{StartReplay} and specify an \code{EventStartTime} and an
\code{EventEndTime} that covers a 20 minute time range, the events are
replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the
events from the second minute are replayed. You can use \code{DescribeReplay}
to determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for
\code{EventLastReplayedTime} indicates the time within the specified time
range associated with the last event replayed.
