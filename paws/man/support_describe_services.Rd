\description{
Returns the current list of AWS services and a list of service
categories for each service. You then use service names and categories
in your CreateCase requests. Each AWS service has its own set of
categories.
}
\details{
The service codes and category codes correspond to the values that
appear in the \strong{Service} and \strong{Category} lists on the AWS Support
Center \href{https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create}{Create Case} page.
The values in those fields don\'t necessarily match the service codes
and categories returned by the \code{DescribeServices} operation. Always use
the service codes and categories that the \code{DescribeServices} operation
returns, so that you have the most recent set of service and category
codes.
\itemize{
\item You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS
Support API.
\item If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a
Business or Enterprise support plan, the
\code{SubscriptionRequiredException} error message appears. For
information about changing your support plan, see \href{http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/}{AWS Support}.
