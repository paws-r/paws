\details{
If deletion protection is enabled, you must first disable it before you
can delete the ledger using the QLDB API or the AWS Command Line
Interface (AWS CLI). You can disable it by calling the \code{UpdateLedger}
operation to set the flag to \code{false}. The QLDB console disables deletion
protection for you when you use it to delete a ledger.
