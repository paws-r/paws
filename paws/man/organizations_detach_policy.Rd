\title{Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or
account}
\usage{
organizations_detach_policy(PolicyId, TargetId)
}
\arguments{
\item{PolicyId}{[required] The unique identifier (ID) of the policy you want to detach. You can get
the ID from the ListPolicies or ListPoliciesForTarget operations.

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} for a policy ID
string requires "p-" followed by from 8 to 128 lower-case letters or
digits.}

\item{TargetId}{[required] The unique identifier (ID) of the root, OU, or account that you want to
detach the policy from. You can get the ID from the ListRoots,
ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent, or ListAccounts operations.

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} for a target ID
string requires one of the following:
\itemize{
\item Root: a string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to 32
lower-case letters or digits.
\item Account: a string that consists of exactly 12 digits.
\item Organizational unit (OU): a string that begins with "ou-" followed
by from 4 to 32 lower-case letters or digits (the ID of the root
that the OU is in) followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32
additional lower-case letters or digits.
}}
}
\description{
Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or
account. If the policy being detached is a service control policy (SCP),
the changes to permissions for IAM users and roles in affected accounts
are immediate.
}
\details{
\strong{Note:} Every root, OU, and account must have at least one SCP
attached. If you want to replace the default \code{FullAWSAccess} policy with
one that limits the permissions that can be delegated, you must attach
the replacement policy before you can remove the default one. This is
the authorization strategy of
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html#orgs_policies_whitelist}{whitelisting}.
If you instead attach a second SCP and leave the \code{FullAWSAccess} SCP
still attached, and specify \code{"Effect": "Deny"} in the second SCP to
override the \code{"Effect": "Allow"} in the \code{FullAWSAccess} policy (or any
other attached SCP), you're using the authorization strategy of
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html#orgs_policies_blacklist}{blacklisting}.

This operation can be called only from the organization's master
account.
