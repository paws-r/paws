\usage{
s3_upload_part(Body, Bucket, ContentLength, ContentMD5, Key, PartNumber,
  UploadId, SSECustomerAlgorithm, SSECustomerKey, SSECustomerKeyMD5,
  RequestPayer)
}
\arguments{
\item{Body}{Object data.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.}

\item{ContentLength}{Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the
body cannot be determined automatically.}

\item{ContentMD5}{The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the part data. This parameter
is auto-populated when using the command from the CLI. This parameter is
required if object lock parameters are specified.}

\item{Key}{[required] Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.}

\item{PartNumber}{[required] Part number of part being uploaded. This is a positive integer between 1
and 10,000.}

\item{UploadId}{[required] Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being uploaded.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
example, AES256).}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\verb{x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-algorithm header}. This must be
the same encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload
request.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\description{
Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
}
\details{
In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you
have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data
source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing
object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation.

You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload) before
you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3
returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your
upload part request.

Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part
number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within
the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part
number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part
is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last
part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.

To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network,
specify the \code{Content-MD5} header in the upload part request. Amazon S3
checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not
match, Amazon S3 returns an error.

\strong{Note:} After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more
parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to
stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you
either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts
storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.

For more information on multipart uploads, go to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html}{Multipart Upload Overview}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide} .

For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload
API, go to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html}{Multipart Upload API and Permissions}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3
encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing
your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption keys.
If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers
you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the
request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload. For more
information, go to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html}{Using Server-Side Encryption}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions.
Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don\'t need
to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request.
Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters
in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see
CreateMultipartUpload.

If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided
encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must
provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the
following headers.
\itemize{
\item x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-algorithm
\item x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key
\item x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key-MD5
}

\strong{Special Errors}
\itemize{
\item

-   *Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The
    upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have
    been aborted or completed.*

-   *HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found*
