\description{
Welcome to the \emph{Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference}. This guide
provides information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0),
including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.

\href{https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint}{Amazon Pinpoint} is an AWS service
that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging
channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text messages,
voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API
provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the email
channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API.

If you\'re new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also
review the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html}{Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide}.
The \emph{Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide} provides tutorials, code samples,
and procedures that demonstrate how to use Amazon Pinpoint features
programmatically and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into
mobile apps and other types of applications. The guide also provides
information about key topics such as Amazon Pinpoint integration with
other AWS services and the limits that apply to using the service.

The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it
provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the
Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region}{AWS Service Endpoints}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference}. To learn more about AWS
Regions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html}{Managing AWS Regions}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference}.

In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These
Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are
united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant
network connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very
high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing
latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are
available in each Region, see \href{http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/}{AWS Global Infrastructure}.
