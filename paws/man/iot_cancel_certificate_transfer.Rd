\item{certificateId}{[required] The ID of the certificate. (The last part of the certificate ARN

\description{
Cancels a pending transfer for the specified certificate.
}
\details{
\strong{Note} Only the transfer source account can use this operation to
cancel a transfer. (Transfer destinations can use
RejectCertificateTransfer instead.) After transfer, AWS IoT returns the
certificate to the source account in the INACTIVE state. After the
destination account has accepted the transfer, the transfer cannot be
cancelled.

After a certificate transfer is cancelled, the status of the certificate
changes from PENDING\\_TRANSFER to INACTIVE.
