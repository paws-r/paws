  Filter, Metrics, GroupBy, NextPageToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{TimePeriod}{[required] Sets the start and end dates for retrieving Amazon Web Services costs.
The range must be within the last 14 days (the start date cannot be
earlier than 14 days ago). The start date is inclusive, but the end date
is exclusive. For example, if \code{start} is \code{2017-01-01} and \code{end} is
\code{2017-05-01}, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from
\code{2017-01-01} up to and including \code{2017-04-30} but not including
\code{2017-05-01}.}

\item{Granularity}{Sets the AWS cost granularity to \code{MONTHLY}, \code{DAILY}, or \code{HOURLY}. If
\code{Granularity} isn\'t set, the response object doesn\'t include the
\code{Granularity}, \code{MONTHLY}, \code{DAILY}, or \code{HOURLY}.}

\item{Filter}{Filters Amazon Web Services costs by different dimensions. For example,
you can specify \code{SERVICE} and \code{LINKED_ACCOUNT} and get the costs that
are associated with that account\'s usage of that service. You can nest
\code{Expression} objects to define any combination of dimension filters. For
more information, see
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html}{Expression}.

The \code{GetCostAndUsageWithResources} operation requires that you either
group by or filter by a \code{ResourceId}.}

\item{Metrics}{Which metrics are returned in the query. For more information about
blended and unblended rates, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/blended-rates-intro/}{Why does the \"blended\" annotation appear on some line items in my bill?}.

Valid values are \code{AmortizedCost}, \code{BlendedCost}, \code{NetAmortizedCost},
\code{NetUnblendedCost}, \code{NormalizedUsageAmount}, \code{UnblendedCost}, and
\code{UsageQuantity}.

If you return the \code{UsageQuantity} metric, the service aggregates all
usage numbers without taking the units into account. For example, if you
aggregate \code{usageQuantity} across all of Amazon EC2, the results aren\'t
meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer are
measured in different units (for example, hours vs. GB). To get more
meaningful \code{UsageQuantity} metrics, filter by \code{UsageType} or
\code{UsageTypeGroups}.

\code{Metrics} is required for \code{GetCostAndUsageWithResources} requests.}

\item{GroupBy}{You can group Amazon Web Services costs using up to two different
groups: either dimensions, tag keys, or both.}

\item{NextPageToken}{The token to retrieve the next set of results. AWS provides the token
when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum
page size.}
}
\description{
Retrieves cost and usage metrics with resources for your account. You
can specify which cost and usage-related metric, such as \code{BlendedCosts}
or \code{UsageQuantity}, that you want the request to return. You can also
filter and group your data by various dimensions, such as \code{SERVICE} or
\code{AZ}, in a specific time range. For a complete list of valid dimensions,
see the
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetDimensionValues.html}{GetDimensionValues}
operation. Master accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations have
access to all member accounts. This API is currently available for the
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud -- Compute service only.
