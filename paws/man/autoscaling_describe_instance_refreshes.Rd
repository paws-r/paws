\item{InstanceRefreshIds}{One or more instance refresh IDs.}

\item{NextToken}{The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token

\details{
You can determine the status of a request by looking at the \code{Status}
parameter. The following are the possible statuses:
\itemize{
\item \code{Pending} - The request was created, but the operation has not
started.
\item \code{InProgress} - The operation is in progress.
\item \code{Successful} - The operation completed successfully.
\item \code{Failed} - The operation failed to complete. You can troubleshoot
using the status reason and the scaling activities.
\item \code{Cancelling} - An ongoing operation is being cancelled. Cancellation
does not roll back any replacements that have already been
completed, but it prevents new replacements from being started.
\item \code{Cancelled} - The operation is cancelled.
}
