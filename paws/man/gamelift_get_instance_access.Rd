\title{Requests remote access to a fleet instance}
\usage{
gamelift_get_instance_access(FleetId, InstanceId)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetId}{[required] A unique identifier for a fleet that contains the instance you want
access to. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. The fleet can
be in any of the following statuses: \code{ACTIVATING}, \code{ACTIVE}, or \code{ERROR}.
Fleets with an \code{ERROR} status may be accessible for a short time before
they are deleted.}

\item{InstanceId}{[required] A unique identifier for an instance you want to get access to. You can
access an instance in any status.}
}
\description{
Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for
debugging, gathering benchmarking data, or watching activity in real
time.
}
\details{
Access requires credentials that match the operating system of the
instance. For a Windows instance, Amazon GameLift returns a user name
and password as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client.
For a Linux instance, Amazon GameLift returns a user name and RSA
private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client. The private
key must be saved in the proper format to a \code{.pem} file before using. If
you\'re making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret can be
handled as part of the GetInstanceAccess request. (See the example later
in this topic). For more information on remote access, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-remote-access.html}{Remotely Accessing an Instance}.

To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the
instance and the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve a fleet\'s
instance IDs by calling DescribeInstances. If successful, an
InstanceAccess object is returned containing the instance\'s IP address
and a set of credentials.
