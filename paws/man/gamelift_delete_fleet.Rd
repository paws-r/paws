\title{Deletes everything related to a fleet}
\usage{
gamelift_delete_fleet(FleetId)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetId}{[required] A unique identifier for a fleet to be deleted. You can use either the
fleet ID or ARN value.}
}
\description{
Deletes everything related to a fleet. Before deleting a fleet, you must
set the fleet\'s desired capacity to zero. See UpdateFleetCapacity.
}
\details{
If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need
to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling
CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization. You do not need to explicitly delete the
VPC peering connection\\--this is done as part of the delete fleet
process.

This action removes the fleet\'s resources and the fleet record. Once a
fleet is deleted, you can no longer use that fleet.
