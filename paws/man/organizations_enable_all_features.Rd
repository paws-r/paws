\title{Enables all features in an organization}
\usage{
organizations_enable_all_features()
}
\description{
Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of
organization policies that can restrict the services and actions that
can be called in each account. Until you enable all features, you have
access only to consolidated billing. You can\'t use any of the advanced
account administration features that AWS Organizations supports. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html}{Enabling All Features in Your Organization}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}
}
\details{
This operation is required only for organizations that were created
explicitly with only the consolidated billing features enabled. Calling
this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in the
organization. The feature set change can be finalized and the additional
features enabled only after all administrators in the invited accounts
approve the change. Accepting the handshake approves the change.

After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable
individual policy types in a root using EnablePolicyType and
DisablePolicyType. To see the status of policy types in a root, use
ListRoots.

After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize the
feature set change by accepting the handshake that contains
\code{"Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"}. This completes the change.

After you enable all features in your organization, the master account
in the organization can apply policies on all member accounts. These
policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those
accounts can do. The master account can apply policies that prevent
accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account
administrators are aware of this.

This operation can be called only from the organization\'s master
account.
