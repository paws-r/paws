\title{For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code

the repository}
\usage{
codebuild_create_webhook(projectName, branchFilter, filterGroups)
}
\arguments{
\item{projectName}{[required] The name of the AWS CodeBuild project.}

\item{branchFilter}{A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are
built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the
regular expression, then it is built. If \code{branchFilter} is empty, then
all branches are built.

It is recommended that you use \code{filterGroups} instead of \code{branchFilter}.}

\item{filterGroups}{An array of arrays of \code{WebhookFilter} objects used to determine which
webhooks are triggered. At least one \code{WebhookFilter} in the array must
specify \code{EVENT} as its \code{type}.

For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the
\code{filterGroups} array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of its
filters must pass.}

\details{
If you enable webhooks for an AWS CodeBuild project, and the project is
used as a build step in AWS CodePipeline, then two identical builds are
created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and
one through AWS CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis,
you are billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using AWS
CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in AWS CodeBuild.
In the AWS CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more
information, see step 5 in \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/change-project.html#change-project-console}{Change a Build Project\'s Settings}.
