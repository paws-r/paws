\usage{
sesv2_create_email_identity(EmailIdentity, Tags, DkimSigningAttributes)
}
\arguments{
\item{EmailIdentity}{[required] The email address or domain that you want to verify.}

\item{Tags}{An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that you want
to associate with the email identity.}

\item{DkimSigningAttributes}{If your request includes this object, Amazon SES configures the identity
to use Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM) for DKIM authentication purposes,
as opposed to the default method, \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html}{Easy DKIM}.

You can only specify this object if the email identity is a domain, as
opposed to an address.}
}
\description{
Starts the process of verifying an email identity. An \emph{identity} is an
email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can
use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying
an identity, you demonstrate that you\'re the owner of the identity, and
that you\'ve given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the
identity.
}
\details{
When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the
address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link
in the verification email.

When you verify a domain without specifying the \code{DkimSigningAttributes}
object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert
these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS
configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES
detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This
verification method is known as \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html}{Easy DKIM}.

Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing
your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as
Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the
\code{CreateEmailIdentity} operation has to include the
\code{DkimSigningAttributes} object. When you specify this object, you
provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies
the public key that you want to use for DKIM authentication) and a
private key.
