\title{Creates an alias for a fleet}
\usage{
gamelift_create_alias(Name, Description, RoutingStrategy, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do not
need to be unique.}

\item{Description}{A human-readable description of the alias.}

\item{RoutingStrategy}{[required] The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet target, for
the alias.}

\item{Tags}{A list of labels to assign to the new alias resource. Tags are
developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for
resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html}{Tagging AWS Resources}
in the \emph{AWS General Reference}. Once the resource is created, you can
use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove,
and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the
AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.}

\description{
Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias
ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for
a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to
another, such as when updating your game build.
}
\details{
Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases:
simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A
terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of
routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a
terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want
to direct players to an upgrade site.

To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and
optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but
a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is
returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to
another fleet by calling \code{UpdateAlias}.
