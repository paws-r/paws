number}
\usage{
ec2_create_network_acl_entry(CidrBlock, DryRun, Egress, IcmpTypeCode,
  Ipv6CidrBlock, NetworkAclId, PortRange, Protocol, RuleAction,
  RuleNumber)
}
\arguments{
\item{CidrBlock}{The IPv4 network range to allow or deny, in CIDR notation (for example
\verb{172.16.0.0/24}).}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{Egress}{[required] Indicates whether this is an egress rule (rule is applied to traffic
leaving the subnet).}

\item{IcmpTypeCode}{ICMP protocol: The ICMP or ICMPv6 type and code. Required if specifying
protocol 1 (ICMP) or protocol 58 (ICMPv6) with an IPv6 CIDR block.}

\item{Ipv6CidrBlock}{The IPv6 network range to allow or deny, in CIDR notation (for example
\verb{2001:db8:1234:1a00::/64}).}

\item{NetworkAclId}{[required] The ID of the network ACL.}

\item{PortRange}{TCP or UDP protocols: The range of ports the rule applies to. Required
if specifying protocol 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP).}

\item{Protocol}{[required] The protocol number. A value of \"-1\" means all protocols. If you
specify \"-1\" or a protocol number other than \"6\" (TCP), \"17\"
(UDP), or \"1\" (ICMP), traffic on all ports is allowed, regardless of
any ports or ICMP types or codes that you specify. If you specify
protocol \"58\" (ICMPv6) and specify an IPv4 CIDR block, traffic for all
ICMP types and codes allowed, regardless of any that you specify. If you
specify protocol \"58\" (ICMPv6) and specify an IPv6 CIDR block, you
must specify an ICMP type and code.}

\item{RuleAction}{[required] Indicates whether to allow or deny the traffic that matches the rule.}

\item{RuleNumber}{[required] The rule number for the entry (for example, 100). ACL entries are
processed in ascending order by rule number.

Constraints: Positive integer from 1 to 32766. The range 32767 to 65535
is reserved for internal use.}
}
\description{
Creates an entry (a rule) in a network ACL with the specified rule
number. Each network ACL has a set of numbered ingress rules and a
separate set of numbered egress rules. When determining whether a packet
should be allowed in or out of a subnet associated with the ACL, we
process the entries in the ACL according to the rule numbers, in
ascending order. Each network ACL has a set of ingress rules and a
separate set of egress rules.
}
\details{
We recommend that you leave room between the rule numbers (for example,
100, 110, 120, \\...), and not number them one right after the other (for
example, 101, 102, 103, \\...). This makes it easier to add a rule
between existing ones without having to renumber the rules.

After you add an entry, you can\'t modify it; you must either replace
it, or create an entry and delete the old one.
