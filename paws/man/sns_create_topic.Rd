ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, and must be between 1

\item{Attributes}{A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special

failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.
\item \code{DisplayName} -- The display name to use for a topic with SMS
subscriptions.
\item \code{Policy} -- The policy that defines who can access your topic. By
default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.
}

The following attribute applies only to
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html}{server-side-encryption}:
\itemize{
\item \code{KmsMasterKeyId} - The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key
(CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html#sse-key-terms}{Key Terms}.
For more examples, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters}{KeyId}

\description{
Creates a topic to which notifications can be published. Users can
create at most 100,000 topics. For more information, see
\href{http://aws.amazon.com/sns/}{https://aws.amazon.com/sns}. This action is
idempotent, so if the requester already owns a topic with the specified
name, that topic\'s ARN is returned without creating a new topic.
