\description{
Deletes a previously created document classifier
}
\details{
Only those classifiers that are in terminated states (IN\\_ERROR,
TRAINED) will be deleted. If an active inference job is using the model,
a \code{ResourceInUseException} will be returned.

This is an asynchronous action that puts the classifier into a DELETING
state, and it is then removed by a background job. Once removed, the
classifier disappears from your account and is no longer available for
use.
