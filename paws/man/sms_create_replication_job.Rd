\title{Creates a replication job}
\usage{
sms_create_replication_job(serverId, seedReplicationTime, frequency,
  runOnce, licenseType, roleName, description, numberOfRecentAmisToKeep,
  encrypted, kmsKeyId)
}
\arguments{
\item{serverId}{[required] The identifier of the server.}

\item{seedReplicationTime}{[required] The seed replication time.}

\item{frequency}{The time between consecutive replication runs, in hours.}

\item{runOnce}{}

\item{licenseType}{The license type to be used for the AMI created by a successful
replication run.}

\item{roleName}{The name of the IAM role to be used by the AWS SMS.}

\item{description}{The description of the replication job.}

\item{numberOfRecentAmisToKeep}{The maximum number of SMS-created AMIs to retain. The oldest will be
deleted once the maximum number is reached and a new AMI is created.}

\item{encrypted}{When \emph{true}, the replication job produces encrypted AMIs. See also
\code{KmsKeyId} below.}

\item{kmsKeyId}{KMS key ID for replication jobs that produce encrypted AMIs. Can be any
of the following:
\itemize{
\item KMS key ID
\item KMS key alias
\item ARN referring to KMS key ID
\item ARN referring to KMS key alias
}

If encrypted is \emph{true} but a KMS key id is not specified, the
customer\'s default KMS key for EBS is used.}
}
\description{
Creates a replication job. The replication job schedules periodic
replication runs to replicate your server to AWS. Each replication run
creates an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
