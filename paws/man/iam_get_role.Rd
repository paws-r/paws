\description{
Retrieves information about the specified role, including the role\'s
path, GUID, ARN, and the role\'s trust policy that grants permission to
assume the role. For more information about roles, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html}{Working with Roles}.
}
\details{
Policies returned by this API are URL-encoded compliant with \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986}{RFC 3986}. You can use a URL decoding
method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if
you use Java, you can use the \code{decode} method of the
\code{java.net.URLDecoder} utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and
SDKs provide similar functionality.
