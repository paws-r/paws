iot_cancel_job(jobId, reasonCode, comment, force)
}
\arguments{
\item{jobId}{[required] The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.}

\item{reasonCode}{(Optional)A reason code string that explains why the job was canceled.}

\item{comment}{An optional comment string describing why the job was canceled.}

\item{force}{(Optional) If \code{true} job executions with status \"IN\\_PROGRESS\" and
\"QUEUED\" are canceled, otherwise only job executions with status
\"QUEUED\" are canceled. The default is \code{false}.

Canceling a job which is \"IN\\_PROGRESS\", will cause a device which is
executing the job to be unable to update the job execution status. Use
caution and ensure that each device executing a job which is canceled is
able to recover to a valid state.}
