\description{
Returns the metadata for one service or a list of the metadata for all
services. Use this without a service code to get the service codes for
all services. Use it with a service code, such as \code{AmazonEC2}, to get
information specific to that service, such as the attribute names
available for that service. For example, some of the attribute names
available for EC2 are \code{volumeType}, \code{maxIopsVolume}, \code{operation},
\code{locationType}, and \code{instanceCapacity10xlarge}.
