\description{
Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and
managing blockchain networks using open source frameworks. Blockchain
allows you to build applications where multiple parties can securely and
transparently run transactions and share data without the need for a
trusted, central authority. Currently, Managed Blockchain supports the
Hyperledger Fabric open source framework.
