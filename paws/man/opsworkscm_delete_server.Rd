\description{
Deletes the server and the underlying AWS CloudFormation stacks
(including the server\'s EC2 instance). When you run this command, the
server state is updated to \code{DELETING}. After the server is deleted, it
is no longer returned by \code{DescribeServer} requests. If the AWS
CloudFormation stack cannot be deleted, the server cannot be deleted.
}
\details{
This operation is asynchronous.

An \code{InvalidStateException} is thrown when a server deletion is already
in progress. A \code{ResourceNotFoundException} is thrown when the server
does not exist. A \code{ValidationException} is raised when parameters of the
request are not valid.
