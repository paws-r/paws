\description{
This operation removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3
returns a \verb{200 OK} response upon successfully deleting a website
configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a \verb{200 OK} response
if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on
the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a \code{404} response if the bucket specified
in the request does not exist.
}
\details{
This DELETE operation requires the \code{S3:DeleteBucketWebsite} permission.
By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration
attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users
permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket
policy granting them the \code{S3:DeleteBucketWebsite} permission.
