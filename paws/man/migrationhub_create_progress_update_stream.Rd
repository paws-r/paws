\description{
Creates a progress update stream which is an AWS resource used for
access control as well as a namespace for migration task names that is
implicitly linked to your AWS account. It must uniquely identify the
migration tool as it is used for all updates made by the tool; however,
it does not need to be unique for each AWS account because it is scoped
to the AWS account.
