Deletes the specified virtual private gateway. We recommend that before
you delete a virtual private gateway, you detach it from the VPC and
delete the VPN connection. Note that you don\'t need to delete the
virtual private gateway if you plan to delete and recreate the VPN
connection between your VPC and your network.
