\title{Returns a database user name and temporary password with temporary
authorization to log on to an Amazon Redshift database}
\usage{
redshift_get_cluster_credentials(DbUser, DbName, ClusterIdentifier,
  DurationSeconds, AutoCreate, DbGroups)
}
\arguments{
\item{DbUser}{[required] The name of a database user. If a user name matching \code{DbUser} exists in
the database, the temporary user credentials have the same permissions
as the existing user. If \code{DbUser} doesn\'t exist in the database and
\code{Autocreate} is \code{True}, a new user is created using the value for
\code{DbUser} with PUBLIC permissions. If a database user matching the value
for \code{DbUser} doesn\'t exist and \code{Autocreate} is \code{False}, then the
command succeeds but the connection attempt will fail because the user
doesn\'t exist in the database.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_USER.html}{CREATE USER}
in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide.

Constraints:

\item Must be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens. The user name
can\'t be \code{PUBLIC}.
\item Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, underscore, plus sign,
period (dot), at symbol (@), or hyphen.
\item First character must be a letter.
\item Must not contain a colon ( : ) or slash ( / ).
\item Cannot be a reserved word. A list of reserved words can be found in
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_pg_keywords.html}{Reserved Words}
in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide.
}}

\item{DbName}{The name of a database that \code{DbUser} is authorized to log on to. If
\code{DbName} is not specified, \code{DbUser} can log on to any existing database.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens
\item Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, underscore, plus sign,
period (dot), at symbol (@), or hyphen.
\item First character must be a letter.

\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_pg_keywords.html}{Reserved Words}
in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide.
}}

\item{ClusterIdentifier}{[required] The unique identifier of the cluster that contains the database for
which your are requesting credentials. This parameter is case sensitive.}

\item{DurationSeconds}{The number of seconds until the returned temporary password expires.

Constraint: minimum 900, maximum 3600.

Default: 900}

\item{AutoCreate}{Create a database user with the name specified for the user named in
\code{DbUser} if one does not exist.}

\item{DbGroups}{A list of the names of existing database groups that the user named in
\code{DbUser} will join for the current session, in addition to any group
memberships for an existing user. If not specified, a new user is added

\description{
Returns a database user name and temporary password with temporary
authorization to log on to an Amazon Redshift database. The action
returns the database user name prefixed with \verb{IAM:} if \code{AutoCreate} is
\code{False} or \verb{IAMA:} if \code{AutoCreate} is \code{True}. You can optionally specify
one or more database user groups that the user will join at log on. By
default, the temporary credentials expire in 900 seconds. You can
optionally specify a duration between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 3600
seconds (60 minutes). For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/generating-user-credentials.html}{Using IAM Authentication to Generate Database User Credentials}
in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.
}
\details{
The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)user or role that executes
GetClusterCredentials must have an IAM policy attached that allows
access to all necessary actions and resources. For more information
about permissions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-access-control-identity-based.html#redshift-policy-resources.getclustercredentials-resources}{Resource Policies for GetClusterCredentials}
in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

If the \code{DbGroups} parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow the
\code{redshift:JoinGroup} action with access to the listed \code{dbgroups}.

In addition, if the \code{AutoCreate} parameter is set to \code{True}, then the
policy must include the \code{redshift:CreateClusterUser} privilege.

If the \code{DbName} parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow access
to the resource \code{dbname} for the specified database name.
