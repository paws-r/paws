reservation ID is created any time you launch an instance. A
reservation ID has a one-to-one relationship with an instance launch
request, but can be associated with more than one instance if you
launch multiple instances using the same launch request. For
example, if you launch one instance, you get one reservation ID. If
you launch ten instances using the same launch request, you also get
one reservation ID.
\item \code{root-device-name} - The device name of the root device volume (for
example, \verb{/dev/sda1}).

resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag
with the key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for
the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources that have a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{tenancy} - The tenancy of an instance (\code{dedicated} \\| \code{default} \\|
\code{host}).
\item \code{virtualization-type} - The virtualization type of the instance
(\code{paravirtual} \\| \code{hvm}).
\item \code{vpc-id} - The ID of the VPC that the instance is running in.
}}

\item{InstanceIds}{The instance IDs.

Default: Describes all your instances.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve
the remaining results, make another call with the returned \code{NextToken}
value. This value can be between 5 and 1000. You cannot specify this
parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same call.}

\item{NextToken}{The token to request the next page of results.}
}
\description{
Describes the specified instances or all of AWS account\'s instances.
}
\details{
If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns information
for those instances. If you do not specify instance IDs, Amazon EC2
returns information for all relevant instances. If you specify an
instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify an
instance that you do not own, it is not included in the returned
results.

Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This
interval is usually less than one hour.

If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is
experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are
in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the
call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs that
are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.
