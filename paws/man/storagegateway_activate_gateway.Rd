\usage{
storagegateway_activate_gateway(ActivationKey, GatewayName,
  GatewayTimezone, GatewayRegion, GatewayType, TapeDriveType,
  MediumChangerType, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{ActivationKey}{[required] Your gateway activation key. You can obtain the activation key by
sending an HTTP GET request with redirects enabled to the gateway IP
address (port 80). The redirect URL returned in the response provides
you the activation key for your gateway in the query string parameter
\code{activationKey}. It may also include other activation-related
parameters, however, these are merely defaults \\-- the arguments you
pass to the \code{ActivateGateway} API call determine the actual
configuration of your gateway.

For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/get-activation-key.html
in the Storage Gateway User Guide.}

\item{GatewayName}{[required] The name you configured for your gateway.}

\item{GatewayTimezone}{[required] A value that indicates the time zone you want to set for the gateway.
The time zone is of the format \"GMT-hr:mm\" or \"GMT+hr:mm\". For
example, GMT-4:00 indicates the time is 4 hours behind GMT. GMT+2:00
indicates the time is 2 hours ahead of GMT. The time zone is used, for
example, for scheduling snapshots and your gateway\'s maintenance
schedule.}

\item{GatewayRegion}{[required] A value that indicates the AWS Region where you want to store your data.
The gateway AWS Region specified must be the same AWS Region as the AWS
Region in your \code{Host} header in the request. For more information about
available AWS Regions and endpoints for AWS Storage Gateway, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sg_region}{Regions and Endpoints}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Glossary}.

Valid Values: See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sg_region}{AWS Storage Gateway Regions and Endpoints}
in the AWS General Reference.}

\item{GatewayType}{A value that defines the type of gateway to activate. The type specified
is critical to all later functions of the gateway and cannot be changed
after activation. The default value is \code{CACHED}.

Valid Values: \"STORED\", \"CACHED\", \"VTL\", \"FILE\\_S3\"}

\item{TapeDriveType}{The value that indicates the type of tape drive to use for tape gateway.
This field is optional.

Valid Values: \"IBM-ULT3580-TD5\"}

\item{MediumChangerType}{The value that indicates the type of medium changer to use for tape
gateway. This field is optional.

Valid Values: \"STK-L700\", \"AWS-Gateway-VTL\"}

\item{Tags}{A list of up to 50 tags that you can assign to the gateway. Each tag is
a key-value pair.

Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers that
can be represented in UTF-8 format, and the following special
characters: + - = . \\_ : / @. The maximum length of a tag\'s key is 128
characters, and the maximum length for a tag\'s value is 256 characters.}

activation process, you specify information such as the AWS Region that
you want to use for storing snapshots or tapes, the time zone for
scheduled snapshots the gateway snapshot schedule window, an activation

your gateway with your account; for more information, see
UpdateGatewayInformation.
