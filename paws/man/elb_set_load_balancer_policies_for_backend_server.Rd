\title{Replaces the set of policies associated with the specified port on which
the EC2 instance is listening with a new set of policies}
\usage{
elb_set_load_balancer_policies_for_backend_server(LoadBalancerName,
  InstancePort, PolicyNames)
}
\arguments{
\item{LoadBalancerName}{[required] The name of the load balancer.}

\item{InstancePort}{[required] The port number associated with the EC2 instance.}

\item{PolicyNames}{[required] The names of the policies. If the list is empty, then all current
polices are removed from the EC2 instance.}
}
\description{
Replaces the set of policies associated with the specified port on which
the EC2 instance is listening with a new set of policies. At this time,
only the back-end server authentication policy type can be applied to
the instance ports; this policy type is composed of multiple public key
policies.
}
\details{
Each time you use \code{SetLoadBalancerPoliciesForBackendServer} to enable
the policies, use the \code{PolicyNames} parameter to list the policies that
you want to enable.

You can use DescribeLoadBalancers or DescribeLoadBalancerPolicies to
verify that the policy is associated with the EC2 instance.
