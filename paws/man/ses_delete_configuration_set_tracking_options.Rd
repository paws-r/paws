\description{
Deletes an association between a configuration set and a custom domain
for open and click event tracking.
}
\details{
By default, images and links used for tracking open and click events are
hosted on domains operated by Amazon SES. You can configure a subdomain
of your own to handle these events. For information about using custom
domains, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/configure-custom-open-click-domains.html}{Amazon SES Developer Guide}.

Deleting this kind of association will result in emails sent using the
specified configuration set to capture open and click events using the
standard, Amazon SES-operated domains.
