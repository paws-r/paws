\usage{
gamelift_suspend_game_server_group(GameServerGroupName, SuspendActions)
}
\arguments{
\item{GameServerGroupName}{[required] A unique identifier for the game server group. Use either the
GameServerGroup name or ARN value.}

\item{SuspendActions}{[required] The activity to suspend for this game server group.}
}
\description{
\strong{This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and
game server groups.}

Temporarily stops activity on a game server group without terminating
instances or the game server group. You can restart activity by calling
\code{\link[=gamelift_resume_game_server_group]{resume_game_server_group}}. You can
suspend the following activity:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Instance type replacement} - This activity evaluates the current
game hosting viability of all Spot instance types that are defined
for the game server group. It updates the Auto Scaling group to
remove nonviable Spot Instance types, which have a higher chance of
game server interruptions. It then balances capacity across the
remaining viable Spot Instance types. When this activity is
suspended, the Auto Scaling group continues with its current
balance, regardless of viability. Instance protection, utilization
metrics, and capacity scaling activities continue to be active.
}

To suspend activity, specify a game server group ARN and the type of
activity to be suspended. If successful, a GameServerGroup object is
returned showing that the activity is listed in \code{SuspendedActions}.
