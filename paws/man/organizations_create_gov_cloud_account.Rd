\title{This action is available if all of the following are true: - You're
authorized to create accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region}
\usage{
organizations_create_gov_cloud_account(Email, AccountName, RoleName,
  IamUserAccessToBilling)
}
\arguments{
\item{Email}{[required] The email address of the owner to assign to the new member account in
the commercial Region. This email address must not already be associated
with another AWS account. You must use a valid email address to complete
account creation. You can\'t access the root user of the account or
remove an account that was created with an invalid email address. Like
all request parameters for \code{CreateGovCloudAccount}, the request for the
email address for the AWS GovCloud (US) account originates from the
commercial Region. It does not come from the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.}

\item{AccountName}{[required] The friendly name of the member account.}

\item{RoleName}{(Optional)

The name of an IAM role that AWS Organizations automatically
preconfigures in the new member accounts in both the AWS GovCloud (US)
Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the master
account, allowing users in the master account to assume the role, as
permitted by the master account administrator. The role has
administrator permissions in the new member account.

If you don\'t specify this parameter, the role name defaults to
\code{OrganizationAccountAccessRole}.

For more information about how to use this role to access the member
account, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role}{Accessing and Administering the Member Accounts in Your Organization}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide}. See also steps 2 and 3 in
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html}{Tutorial: Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using IAM Roles}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide.}

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} that is used to
validate this parameter. The pattern can include uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, digits with no spaces, and any of the following
characters: =,.@-}

\item{IamUserAccessToBilling}{If set to \code{ALLOW}, the new linked account in the commercial Region
enables IAM users to access account billing information \emph{if} they have
the required permissions. If set to \code{DENY}, only the root user of the
new account can access account billing information. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate}{Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console}
in the \emph{AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.}

If you don\'t specify this parameter, the value defaults to \code{ALLOW}, and
IAM users and roles with the required permissions can access billing
information for the new account.}

This action is available if all of the following are true:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item You\'re authorized to create accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US)
Region. For more information on the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, see
the \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/welcome.html}{\emph{AWS GovCloud User Guide}.}
\item You already have an account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region that is
associated with your master account in the commercial Region.
\item You call this action from the master account of your organization in
the commercial Region.
\item You have the \code{organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount} permission. AWS
Organizations creates the required service-linked role named
\code{AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations}. For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs}{AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}
}

AWS automatically enables AWS CloudTrail for AWS GovCloud (US) accounts,
but you should also do the following:
\itemize{
\item Verify that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.
\item Create an S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail log storage.

For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/verifying-cloudtrail.html}{Verifying AWS CloudTrail Is Enabled}
in the \emph{AWS GovCloud User Guide}.
}

You call this action from the master account of your organization in the
commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS GovCloud
(US) Region. After the account is created, the master account of an
organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that
organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in
the AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html}{AWS Organizations}
in the \emph{AWS GovCloud User Guide.}

Calling \code{CreateGovCloudAccount} is an asynchronous request that AWS
performs in the background. Because \code{CreateGovCloudAccount} operates
asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even
though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need
to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To
check the status of the request, do one of the following:
\itemize{
\item Use the \code{OperationId} response element from this operation to
provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.
\item Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the \code{CreateAccountResult} event.
For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html}{Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}
}

When you call the \code{CreateGovCloudAccount} action, you create two
accounts: a standalone account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region and an
associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support
purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member
of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts
are associated with the same email address.

A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that
allows the master account in the organization in the commercial Region
to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and
associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is
created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account. This role can be assumed
by the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the master
account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view
a diagram that explains how account access works, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html}{AWS Organizations}
in the \emph{AWS GovCloud User Guide.}

For more information about creating accounts, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html}{Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}
\itemize{
\item You can create an account in an organization using the AWS
Organizations console, API, or CLI commands. When you do, the
information required for the account to operate as a standalone
account, such as a payment method, is \emph{not} automatically collected.
If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can
do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the
steps at \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info}{To leave an organization as a member account}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}
\item If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
account limits for the organization, contact \href{https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/}{AWS Support}.
\item If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
then try again. If the error persists, contact \href{https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/}{AWS Support}.
\item Using \code{CreateGovCloudAccount} to create multiple temporary accounts
isn\'t recommended. You can only close an account from the AWS
Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in as
the root user. For information on the requirements and process for
closing an account, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html}{Closing an AWS Account}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide}.
}

When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
whether to create the account with the \strong{IAM User and Role Access to
Billing Information} switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and
roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for
the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access
billing information. For information about how to disable this switch
for an account, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html}{Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools}.
