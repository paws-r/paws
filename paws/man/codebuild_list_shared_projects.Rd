\title{Gets a list of projects that are shared with other AWS accounts or users}
\usage{
codebuild_list_shared_projects(sortBy, sortOrder, maxResults, nextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{sortBy}{The criterion to be used to list build projects shared with the current
AWS account or user. Valid values include:
\itemize{
\item \code{ARN}: List based on the ARN.
\item \code{MODIFIED_TIME}: List based on when information about the shared
project was last changed.
}}

\item{sortOrder}{The order in which to list shared build projects. Valid values include:
\itemize{
\item \code{ASCENDING}: List in ascending order.
\item \code{DESCENDING}: List in descending order.
}}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of paginated shared build projects returned per
response. Use \code{nextToken} to iterate pages in the list of returned
\code{Project} objects. The default value is 100.}

\item{nextToken}{During a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be returned
is the value specified in \code{maxResults}. If there more items in the list,
then a unique string called a \emph{nextToken} is returned. To get the next
batch of items in the list, call this operation again, adding the next
token to the call. To get all of the items in the list, keep calling
this operation with each subsequent next token that is returned, until
no more next tokens are returned.}
