Retrieve a list of the tags (keys and values) that are associated with a
specific resource. AÂ \emph{tag}Â is a label that you optionally define and
associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Each tag consists of a
requiredÂ \emph{tag key}Â and an optional associatedÂ \emph{tag value}. A tag key is
a general label that acts as a category for more specific tag values. A
tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key.
