elastictranscoder_test_role(Role, InputBucket, OutputBucket, Topics)
}
\arguments{
\item{Role}{[required] The IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the role that you want Elastic
Transcoder to test.}

\item{InputBucket}{[required] The Amazon S3 bucket that contains media files to be transcoded. The
action attempts to read from this bucket.}

\item{OutputBucket}{[required] The Amazon S3 bucket that Elastic Transcoder writes transcoded media
files to. The action attempts to read from this bucket.}

\item{Topics}{[required] The ARNs of one or more Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)

}
\description{
The TestRole operation tests the IAM role used to create the pipeline.
}
\details{
The \code{TestRole} action lets you determine whether the IAM role you are
using has sufficient permissions to let Elastic Transcoder perform tasks
associated with the transcoding process. The action attempts to assume
the specified IAM role, checks read access to the input and output
buckets, and tries to send a test notification to Amazon SNS topics that
you specify.
