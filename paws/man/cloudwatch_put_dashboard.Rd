\description{
Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing
dashboard. If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced
with what you specify here.
}
\details{
All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.

A simple way to create a dashboard using \code{PutDashboard} is to copy an
existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you
can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the
Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way
to copy a dashboard is to use \code{GetDashboard}, and then use the data
returned within \code{DashboardBody} as the template for the new dashboard
when you call \code{PutDashboard}.

When you create a dashboard with \code{PutDashboard}, a good practice is to
add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the
dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the
console. This message could also point console users to the location of
the \code{DashboardBody} script or the CloudFormation template used to create
the dashboard.
