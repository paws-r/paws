\description{
Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.
}
\details{
You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create
a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation
using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must
use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html}{Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API}.

All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have
\emph{read} access to the source object and \emph{write} access to the destination
bucket. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html}{REST Authentication}.
Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region
that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.

A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy
request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs
before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3
error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response
is embedded in the \verb{200 OK} response. This means that a \verb{200 OK}
response can contain either a success or an error. Design your
application to parse the contents of the response and handle it
appropriately.

If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about
the copied object.

If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If
it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need
to read the entire body.

The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that
you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/}{Amazon S3 pricing}.

Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If
you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint,
you get a 400 \verb{Bad Request} error. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html}{Transfer Acceleration}.

\strong{Metadata}

When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or
specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to
private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL
setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html}{Using ACLs}.

To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source
object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can
optionally add the \code{x-amz-metadata-directive} header. When you grant
permissions, you can use the \code{s3:x-amz-metadata-directive} condition key
to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html}{Specifying Conditions in a Policy}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Developer Guide}. For a complete list of Amazon
S3-specific condition keys, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html}{Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3}.

\strong{\verb{x-amz-copy-source-if} Headers}

To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the
\code{Etag} matches or whether the object was modified before or after a
specified date, use the following request parameters:
\itemize{
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-match}
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match}
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since}
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since}
}

If both the \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-match} and
\verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since} headers are present in the
request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns \verb{200 OK} and copies
the data:
\itemize{
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-match} condition evaluates to true
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since} condition evaluates to false
}

If both the \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match} and
\verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since} headers are present in the request
and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the \verb{412 Precondition Failed}
response code:
\itemize{
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match} condition evaluates to false
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since} condition evaluates to true
}

All headers with the \verb{x-amz-} prefix, including \code{x-amz-copy-source},
must be signed.

\strong{Encryption}

The source object that you are copying can be encrypted or unencrypted.
The source object can be encrypted with server-side encryption using AWS
managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or by using a
customer-provided encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3
encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
decrypts the data when you access it.

You can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to
request server-side encryption for the target object. You have the
option to provide your own encryption key or use SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS,
regardless of the form of server-side encryption that was used to
encrypt the source object. You can even request encryption if the source
object was not encrypted. For more information about server-side
encryption, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html}{Using Server-Side Encryption}.

\strong{Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers}

When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant
ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the
owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant
permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html}{Access Control List (ACL) Overview}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html}{Managing ACLs Using the REST API}.

\strong{Storage Class Options}

You can use the \code{CopyObject} operation to change the storage class of an
object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the \code{StorageClass}
parameter. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html}{Storage Classes}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide}.

\strong{Versioning}

By default, \code{x-amz-copy-source} identifies the current version of an
object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3
behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use
the \code{versionId} subresource.

If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a
unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is
different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns
the version ID of the copied object in the \code{x-amz-version-id} response
header in the response.

If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the
version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.

If the source object\'s storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a
copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the
copy operation. For more information, see .

The following operations are related to \code{CopyObject}:
\itemize{
\item PutObject
\item GetObject
}
