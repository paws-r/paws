\title{Promotes a Read Replica DB instance to a standalone DB instance}
\usage{
rds_promote_read_replica(DBInstanceIdentifier, BackupRetentionPeriod,
  PreferredBackupWindow)
}
\arguments{
\item{DBInstanceIdentifier}{[required] The DB instance identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must match the identifier of an existing Read Replica DB instance.
}

Example: \code{mydbinstance}}

\item{BackupRetentionPeriod}{The number of days for which automated backups are retained. Setting
this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this
parameter to 0 disables automated backups.

Default: 1

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be a value from 0 to 35.
\item Can\'t be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to Read Replicas.
}}

\item{PreferredBackupWindow}{The daily time range during which automated backups are created if
automated backups are enabled, using the \code{BackupRetentionPeriod}
parameter.

The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
block of time for each AWS Region. To see the time blocks available, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow.html}{Adjusting the Preferred Maintenance Window}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be in the format \code{hh24:mi-hh24:mi}.
\item Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
\item Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.
\item Must be at least 30 minutes.

\description{
Promotes a Read Replica DB instance to a standalone DB instance.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Backup duration is a function of the amount of changes to the
database since the previous backup. If you plan to promote a Read
Replica to a standalone instance, we recommend that you enable
backups and complete at least one backup prior to promotion. In
addition, a Read Replica cannot be promoted to a standalone instance
when it is in the \code{backing-up} status. If you have enabled backups
on your Read Replica, configure the automated backup window so that
daily backups do not interfere with Read Replica promotion.
\item This command doesn\'t apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL.
