\item{name}{[required] The name of the webhook you want to delete.}
}
\description{
Deletes a previously created webhook by name. Deleting the webhook stops
AWS CodePipeline from starting a pipeline every time an external event
occurs. The API returns successfully when trying to delete a webhook
that is already deleted. If a deleted webhook is re-created by calling
PutWebhook with the same name, it will have a different URL.
