\description{
Disassociates an Elastic IP address from the instance or network
interface it\'s associated with.
}
\details{
An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or
in a VPC. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html}{Elastic IP Addresses}
in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide}.

This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than
once, Amazon EC2 doesn\'t return an error.
