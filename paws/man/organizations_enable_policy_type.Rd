\title{Enables a policy type in a root}
\usage{
organizations_enable_policy_type(RootId, PolicyType)
}
\arguments{
\item{RootId}{[required] The unique identifier (ID) of the root in which you want to enable a
policy type. You can get the ID from the ListRoots operation.

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} for a root ID
string requires \"r-\" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or
digits.}

\item{PolicyType}{[required] The policy type that you want to enable.}
}
\description{
Enables a policy type in a root. After you enable a policy type in a
root, you can attach policies of that type to the root, any
organizational unit (OU), or account in that root. You can undo this by
using the DisablePolicyType operation.
}
\details{
This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. AWS
recommends that you first use ListRoots to see the status of policy
types for a specified root, and then use this operation.

This operation can be called only from the organization\'s master
account.

You can enable a policy type in a root only if that policy type is
available in the organization. To view the status of available policy
types in the organization, use DescribeOrganization.
