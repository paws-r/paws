\description{
Deletes the messages in a queue specified by the \code{QueueURL} parameter.
}
\details{
When you use the \code{PurgeQueue} action, you can\'t retrieve any messages
deleted from a queue.

The message deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. We recommend
waiting for 60 seconds regardless of your queue\'s size.

Messages sent to the queue \emph{before} you call \code{PurgeQueue} might be
received but are deleted within the next minute.

Messages sent to the queue \emph{after} you call \code{PurgeQueue} might be
deleted while the queue is being purged.
