\title{Returns a list of fleets}
\usage{
robomaker_list_fleets(nextToken, maxResults, filters)
}
\arguments{
\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated \code{ListFleets}
request where \code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value
of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous
results that returned the \code{nextToken} value.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used
to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
purposes.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of deployment job results returned by \code{ListFleets} in
paginated output. When this parameter is used, \code{ListFleets} only returns
\code{maxResults} results in a single page along with a \code{nextToken} response
element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by
sending another \code{ListFleets} request with the returned \code{nextToken}
value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not
used, then \code{ListFleets} returns up to 100 results and a \code{nextToken}
value if applicable.}

\item{filters}{Optional filters to limit results.

The filter name \code{name} is supported. When filtering, you must use the
complete value of the filtered item. You can use up to three filters.}
}
\description{
Returns a list of fleets. You can optionally provide filters to retrieve
specific fleets.
