## Overview

Paws is a **P**ackage for **A**mazon **W**eb **S**ervices in R. Paws provides
access to the full suite of AWS services from within R.

[Click here](docs/cheat_sheet.pdf) to view our Paws cheat sheet.

Disclaimer: Paws is not a product of or supported by Amazon Web Services.

## Installation

Install Paws using:

``` r
install.packages("paws")
```

## Credentials

You'll need to set up your AWS credentials and region. Paws supports R
and OS environment variables, AWS credential files, and IAM roles.
See [docs/credentials.md](docs/credentials.md) for more info.

In the example below, we set them with R environment variables.

Warning: Do not save your credentials in your code. If you do,
you could accidentally upload them to GitHub where they'd be visible
to everyone. Use one of the other methods above instead. See also
[RStudio's best practices for securing credentials](https://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/managing-credentials/#encrypt-credentials-with-keyring).

``` r
Sys.setenv(
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "abc",
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "123",
  AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"
)
```

## Usage

To use a service, create a client. All of a service's operations
can be accessed from this object.

``` r
ec2 <- paws::ec2()
```

Launch an EC2 instance using the `run_instances` function.

``` r
resp <- ec2$run_instances(
  ImageId = "ami-f973ab84",
  InstanceType = "t2.micro",
  KeyName = "default",
  MinCount = 1,
  MaxCount = 1,
  TagSpecifications = list(
    list(
      ResourceType = "instance",
      Tags = list(
        list(Key = "webserver", Value = "production")
      )
    )
  )
)
```

List all of your instances with `describe_instances`.

``` r
ec2$describe_instances()
```

Shut down the instance you started with `terminate_instances`.

``` r
ec2$terminate_instances(
  InstanceIds = resp$Instances[[1]]$InstanceId
)
```

## Documentation

You can browse all available services by looking at the package documentation.

``` r
help(package = "paws")
```

You can also jump to a specific service and see all its operations.

``` r
?paws::ec2
```

RStudio's code completion will show you the available services,
their operations, and each operation's parameters.
