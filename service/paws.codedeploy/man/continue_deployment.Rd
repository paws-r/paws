\description{
For a blue/green deployment, starts the process of rerouting traffic from instances in the original environment to instances in the replacement environment without waiting for a specified wait time to elapse. (Traffic rerouting, which is achieved by registering instances in the replacement environment with the load balancer, can start as soon as all instances have a status of Ready.)
