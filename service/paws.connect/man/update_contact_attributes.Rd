\usage{
update_contact_attributes(InitialContactId, InstanceId, Attributes)
}
\arguments{
\item{InitialContactId}{[required] The unique identifier of the contact for which to update attributes. This is the identifier for the contact associated with the first interaction with the contact center.}

\item{InstanceId}{[required] The identifier for your Amazon Connect instance. To find the ID of your instance, open the AWS console and select Amazon Connect. Select the alias of the instance in the Instance alias column. The instance ID is displayed in the Overview section of your instance settings. For example, the instance ID is the set of characters at the end of the instance ARN, after instance/, such as 10a4c4eb-f57e-4d4c-b602-bf39176ced07.}

\item{Attributes}{[required] Specify a custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The attributes are standard Amazon Connect attributes, and can be accessed in contact flows just like any other contact attributes.

\description{
The \code{UpdateContactAttributes} operation lets you programmatically create new, or update existing, contact attributes associated with a contact. You can use the operation to add or update attributes for both ongoing and completed contacts. For example, you can update the customer's name or the reason the customer called while the call is active, or add notes about steps that the agent took during the call that are displayed to the next agent that takes the call. You can also use the \code{UpdateContactAttributes} operation to update attributes for a contact using data from your CRM application and save the data with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for additional analysis, such as legal review or identifying abusive callers.
}
\details{
Contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are then deleted.

\emph{Important:}

You cannot use the operation to update attributes for contacts that occurred prior to the release of the API, September 12, 2018. You can update attributes only for contacts that started after the release of the API. If you attempt to update attributes for a contact that occurred prior to the release of the API, a 400 error is returned. This applies also to queued callbacks that were initiated prior to the release of the API but are still active in your instance.
