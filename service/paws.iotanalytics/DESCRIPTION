Description: AWS IoT Analytics allows you to collect large
    amounts of device data, process messages, and store them. You can then
    query the data and run sophisticated analytics on it. AWS IoT
    Analytics enables advanced data exploration through integration with
    Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration with
    Amazon QuickSight.
