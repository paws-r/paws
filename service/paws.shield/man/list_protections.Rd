\title{Lists all Protection objects for the account}
\usage{
list_protections(NextToken = NULL, MaxResults = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{NextToken}{The \code{ListProtectionsRequest.NextToken} value from a previous call to \code{ListProtections}. Pass null if this is the first call.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of Protection objects to be returned. If this is left blank the first 20 results will be returned.

This is a maximum value; it is possible that AWS WAF will return the results in smaller batches. That is, the number of Protection objects returned could be less than \code{MaxResults}, even if there are still more Protection objects yet to return. If there are more Protection objects to return, AWS WAF will always also return a \code{NextToken}.}
