Retrieves the properties of the requested container. This request is commonly used to retrieve the endpoint of a container. An endpoint is a value assigned by the service when a new container is created. A container's endpoint does not change after it has been assigned. The \code{DescribeContainer} request returns a single \code{Container} object based on \code{ContainerName}. To return all \code{Container} objects that are associated with a specified AWS account, use ListContainers.
