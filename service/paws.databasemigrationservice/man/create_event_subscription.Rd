\title{Creates an AWS DMS event notification subscription}
\usage{
create_event_subscription(SubscriptionName, SnsTopicArn,
  SourceType = NULL, EventCategories = NULL, SourceIds = NULL,
  Enabled = NULL, Tags = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{SubscriptionName}{[required] The name of the AWS DMS event notification subscription.

Constraints: The name must be less than 255 characters.}

\item{SnsTopicArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic created for event notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create a topic and subscribe to it.}

\item{SourceType}{The type of AWS DMS resource that generates the events. For example, if you want to be notified of events generated by a replication instance, you set this parameter to \code{replication-instance}. If this value is not specified, all events are returned.

Valid values: replication-instance | migration-task}

\item{EventCategories}{A list of event categories for a source type that you want to subscribe to. You can see a list of the categories for a given source type by calling the \code{DescribeEventCategories} action or in the topic \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Events.html}{Working with Events and Notifications} in the \emph{AWS Database Migration Service User Guide.}}

\item{SourceIds}{The list of identifiers of the event sources for which events will be returned. If not specified, then all sources are included in the response. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.}

\item{Enabled}{A Boolean value; set to \code{true} to activate the subscription, or set to \code{false} to create the subscription but not activate it.}

\item{Tags}{A tag to be attached to the event subscription.}
}
\description{
Creates an AWS DMS event notification subscription.
}
\details{
You can specify the type of source (\code{SourceType}) you want to be notified of, provide a list of AWS DMS source IDs (\code{SourceIds}) that triggers the events, and provide a list of event categories (\code{EventCategories}) for events you want to be notified of. If you specify both the \code{SourceType} and \code{SourceIds}, such as \code{SourceType = replication-instance} and \code{SourceIdentifier = my-replinstance}, you will be notified of all the replication instance events for the specified source. If you specify a \code{SourceType} but don't specify a \code{SourceIdentifier}, you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your AWS DMS sources. If you don't specify either \code{SourceType} nor \code{SourceIdentifier}, you will be notified of events generated from all AWS DMS sources belonging to your customer account.

For more information about AWS DMS events, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Events.html}{Working with Events and Notifications} in the \emph{AWS Database Migration Service User Guide.}
