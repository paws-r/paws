Description: AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) can
    migrate your data to and from the most widely used commercial and
    open-source databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL
    Server, Amazon Redshift, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora, MySQL, and SAP
    Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE). The service supports homogeneous
    migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous
    migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to
    MySQL or SQL Server to PostgreSQL.
