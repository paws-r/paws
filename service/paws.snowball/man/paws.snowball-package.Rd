\title{paws.snowball: Amazon Import/Export Snowball}
\description{
AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport
    solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data
    between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage
    Service (Amazon S3). The commands described here provide access to the
    same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball Management
    Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for Snowball and
    Snowball Edge devices. To transfer data locally with a device, you\'ll
    need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for
    Snowball.
