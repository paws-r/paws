Description: AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport
    solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data
    between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage
    Service (Amazon S3). The Snowball commands described here provide
    access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball
    Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for
    Snowball. To transfer data locally with a Snowball device, you\'ll
    need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for
    Snowball. For more information, see the [User
    Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html).
