\title{Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM user's permissions boundary}
\usage{
put_user_permissions_boundary(UserName, PermissionsBoundary)
}
\arguments{
\item{UserName}{[required] The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the IAM user for which you want to set the permissions boundary.}

\item{PermissionsBoundary}{[required] The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the user.}
}
\description{
Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM user's permissions boundary. You can use an AWS managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for a user. Use the boundary to control the maximum permissions that the user can have. Setting a permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the permissions for the user.
}
\details{
Policies that are used as permissions boundaries do not provide permissions. You must also attach a permissions policy to the user. To learn how the effective permissions for a user are evaluated, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html}{IAM JSON Policy Evaluation Logic} in the IAM User Guide.
