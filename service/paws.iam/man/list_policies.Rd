\title{Lists all the managed policies that are available in your AWS account, including your own customer-defined managed policies and all AWS managed policies}
\usage{
list_policies(Scope = NULL, OnlyAttached = NULL, PathPrefix = NULL,
  PolicyUsageFilter = NULL, Marker = NULL, MaxItems = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Scope}{The scope to use for filtering the results.

To list only AWS managed policies, set \code{Scope} to \code{AWS}. To list only the customer managed policies in your AWS account, set \code{Scope} to \code{Local}.

This parameter is optional. If it is not included, or if it is set to \code{All}, all policies are returned.}

\item{OnlyAttached}{A flag to filter the results to only the attached policies.

When \code{OnlyAttached} is \code{true}, the returned list contains only the policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role. When \code{OnlyAttached} is \code{false}, or when the parameter is not included, all policies are returned.}

\item{PathPrefix}{The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies. This parameter allows (per its \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern}) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.}

\item{PolicyUsageFilter}{The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

To list only permissions policies, setÂ \code{PolicyUsageFilter}Â toÂ \code{PermissionsPolicy}. To list only the policies used to set permissions boundaries, setÂ the value toÂ \code{PermissionsBoundary}.

This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are returned.}

\item{Marker}{Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the \code{Marker} element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.}

\item{MaxItems}{(Optional) Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the \code{IsTruncated} response element is \code{true}.

If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the \code{IsTruncated} response element returns \code{true} and \code{Marker} contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.}

\details{
You can filter the list of policies that is returned using the optional \code{OnlyAttached}, \code{Scope}, and \code{PathPrefix} parameters. For example, to list only the customer managed policies in your AWS account, set \code{Scope} to \code{Local}. To list only AWS managed policies, set \code{Scope} to \code{AWS}.

You can paginate the results using the \code{MaxItems} and \code{Marker} parameters.
