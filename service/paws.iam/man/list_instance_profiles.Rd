\title{Lists the instance profiles that have the specified path prefix}
\usage{
list_instance_profiles(PathPrefix = NULL, Marker = NULL,
  MaxItems = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{PathPrefix}{The path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix \code{/application_abc/component_xyz/} gets all instance profiles whose path starts with \code{/application_abc/component_xyz/}.

This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all instance profiles. This parameter allows (through its \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern}) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.}

\item{Marker}{Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the \code{Marker} element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.}

\item{MaxItems}{Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the \code{IsTruncated} response element is \code{true}.

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the \code{IsTruncated} response element returns \code{true}, and \code{Marker} contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.}

Lists the instance profiles that have the specified path prefix. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list. For more information about instance profiles, go to \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html}{About Instance Profiles}.

You can paginate the results using the \code{MaxItems} and \code{Marker} parameters.
