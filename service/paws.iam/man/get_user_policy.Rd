\description{
Retrieves the specified inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM user.
}
\details{
Policies returned by this API are URL-encoded compliant with \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986}{RFC 3986}. You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the \code{decode} method of the \code{java.net.URLDecoder} utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

An IAM user can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a user, use GetPolicy to determine the policy's default version, then use GetPolicyVersion to retrieve the policy document.

For more information about policies, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html}{Managed Policies and Inline Policies} in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.
