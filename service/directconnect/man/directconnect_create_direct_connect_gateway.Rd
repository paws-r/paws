\description{
Creates a Direct Connect gateway, which is an intermediate object that
enables you to connect a set of virtual interfaces and virtual private
gateways. A Direct Connect gateway is global and visible in any AWS
Region after it is created. The virtual interfaces and virtual private
gateways that are connected through a Direct Connect gateway can be in
different AWS Regions. This enables you to connect to a VPC in any
Region, regardless of the Region in which the virtual interfaces are
located, and pass traffic between them.
