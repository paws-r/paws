\title{Deletes multiple tables at once}
\usage{
batch_delete_table(CatalogId = NULL, DatabaseName, TablesToDelete)
}
\arguments{
\item{CatalogId}{The ID of the Data Catalog where the table resides. If none is supplied, the AWS account ID is used by default.}

\item{DatabaseName}{[required] The name of the catalog database where the tables to delete reside. For Hive compatibility, this name is entirely lowercase.}

\item{TablesToDelete}{[required] A list of the table to delete.}
}
\description{
Deletes multiple tables at once.
}
\details{
After completing this operation, you will no longer have access to the table versions and partitions that belong to the deleted table. AWS Glue deletes these "orphaned" resources asynchronously in a timely manner, at the discretion of the service.

To ensure immediate deletion of all related resources, before calling \code{BatchDeleteTable}, use \code{DeleteTableVersion} or \code{BatchDeleteTableVersion}, and \code{DeletePartition} or \code{BatchDeletePartition}, to delete any resources that belong to the table.
