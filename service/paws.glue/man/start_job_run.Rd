\usage{
start_job_run(JobName, JobRunId = NULL, Arguments = NULL,
  AllocatedCapacity = NULL, Timeout = NULL, MaxCapacity = NULL,
  NotificationProperty = NULL, SecurityConfiguration = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{JobName}{[required] The name of the job definition to use.}

\item{JobRunId}{The ID of a previous JobRun to retry.}

\item{Arguments}{The job arguments specifically for this run. They override the equivalent default arguments set for in the job definition itself.

You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, as well as arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes.

For information about how to specify and consume your own Job arguments, see the \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html}{Calling AWS Glue APIs in Python} topic in the developer guide.

For information about the key-value pairs that AWS Glue consumes to set up your job, see the \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html}{Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue} topic in the developer guide.}

\item{AllocatedCapacity}{This field is deprecated, use \code{MaxCapacity} instead.

The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) to allocate to this JobRun. From 2 to 100 DPUs can be allocated; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the \href{https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/}{AWS Glue pricing page}.}

\item{Timeout}{The JobRun timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters \code{TIMEOUT} status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours). This overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.}

\item{MaxCapacity}{AWS Glue supports running jobs on a \code{JobCommand.Name}="pythonshell" with allocated processing as low as 0.0625 DPU, which can be specified using \code{MaxCapacity}. Glue ETL jobs running in any other way cannot have fractional DPU allocations.}

\item{NotificationProperty}{Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.}

\item{SecurityConfiguration}{The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this job run.}
