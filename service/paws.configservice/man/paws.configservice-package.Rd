\title{paws.configservice: AWS Config}
\description{
AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the
    configurations of all the AWS resources associated with your AWS
    account. You can use AWS Config to get the current and historical
    configurations of each AWS resource and also to get information about
    the relationship between the resources. An AWS resource can be an
    Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store
    (EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group.
    For a complete list of resources currently supported by AWS Config,
    see [Supported AWS
    Resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources).
