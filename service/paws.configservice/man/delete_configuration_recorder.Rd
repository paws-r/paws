After the configuration recorder is deleted, AWS Config will not record resource configuration changes until you create a new configuration recorder.

You will be able to access the previously recorded information by using the \code{GetResourceConfigHistory} action, but you will not be able to access this information in the AWS Config console until you create a new configuration recorder.
