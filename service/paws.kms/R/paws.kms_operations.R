#' Cancels the deletion of a customer master key (CMK)
#'
#' Cancels the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). When this operation is successful, the CMK is set to the `Disabled` state. To enable a CMK, use EnableKey. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.
#' 
#' For more information about scheduling and canceling deletion of a CMK, see [Deleting Customer Master Keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see [How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

#' Connects or reconnects a [custom key store](http://docs
#'
#' Connects or reconnects a [custom key store](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html) to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.
#' 
#' The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time.
#' 
#' To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the [DescribeClusters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters) operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the [CreateHsm](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm) operation.
#' 
#' The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
#' 
#' During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the [`kmsuser` crypto user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser) (CU), and rotates its password.
#' 
#' The `ConnectCustomKeyStore` operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the `ConnectionErrorCode` in the response. For help interpreting the `ConnectionErrorCode`, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.
#' 
#' To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use `ConnectCustomKeyStore` again.
#' 
#' If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see [Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

#' Creates a display name for a customer master key (CMK)
#'
#' Creates a display name for a customer master key (CMK). You can use an alias to identify a CMK in selected operations, such as Encrypt and GenerateDataKey.
#' 
#' Each CMK can have multiple aliases, but each alias points to only one CMK. The alias name must be unique in the AWS account and region. To simplify code that runs in multiple regions, use the same alias name, but point it to a different CMK in each region.
#' 
#' Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs, use the ListAliases operation.
#' 
#' An alias must start with the word `alias` followed by a forward slash (`alias/`). The alias name can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (\_), and dashes (-). Alias names cannot begin with `aws`; that alias name prefix is reserved by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
#' 
#' The alias and the CMK it is mapped to must be in the same AWS account and the same region. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account.
#' 
#' To map an existing alias to a different CMK, call UpdateAlias.
#' 
#' The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see [How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

#' Creates a [custom key store](http://docs
#'
#' Creates a [custom key store](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html) that is associated with an [AWS CloudHSM cluster](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/clusters.html) that you own and manage.
#' 
#' This operation is part of the [Custom Key Store feature](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html) feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.
#' 
#' When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the new key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster.
#' 
#' The `CreateCustomKeyStore` operation requires the following elements.
#' 
#' -   You must specify an active AWS CloudHSM cluster in the same account and AWS Region as the custom key store. You can use an existing cluster or [create and activate a new AWS CloudHSM cluster](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html) for the key store. AWS KMS does not require exclusive use of the cluster.
#' 
#' -   You must include the content of the *trust anchor certificate* for the cluster. You created this certificate, and saved it in the `customerCA.crt` file, when you [initialized the cluster](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/initialize-cluster.html#sign-csr).
#' 
#' -   You must provide the password of the dedicated [`kmsuser` crypto user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser) (CU) account in the cluster.
#' 
#'     Before you create the custom key store, use the [createUser](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/cloudhsm_mgmt_util-createUser.html) command in `cloudhsm_mgmt_util` to create [a crypto user (CU) named `kmsuser`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser)in specified AWS CloudHSM cluster. AWS KMS uses the `kmsuser` CU account to create and manage key material on your behalf. For instructions, see [Create the kmsuser Crypto User](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keystore.html#before-keystore) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' The AWS CloudHSM cluster that you specify must meet the following requirements.
#' 
#' -   The cluster must be active and be in the same AWS account and Region as the custom key store.
#' 
#' -   Each custom key store must be associated with a different AWS CloudHSM cluster. The cluster cannot be associated with another custom key store or have the same cluster certificate as a cluster that is associated with another custom key store. To view the cluster certificate, use the AWS CloudHSM [DescribeClusters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html) operation. Clusters that share a backup history have the same cluster certificate.
#' 
#' -   The cluster must be configured with subnets in at least two different Availability Zones in the Region. Because AWS CloudHSM is not supported in all Availability Zones, we recommend that the cluster have subnets in all Availability Zones in the Region.
#' 
#' -   The cluster must contain at least two active HSMs, each in a different Availability Zone.
#' 
#' New custom key stores are not automatically connected. After you create your custom key store, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the custom key store to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it.
#' 
#' If this operation succeeds, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. For help with failures, see [Troubleshoot a Custom Key Store](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html) in the *AWS KMS Developer Guide*.

#' To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use ListKeys or DescribeKey.
#' @param GranteePrincipal &#91;required&#93; The principal that is given permission to perform the operations that the grant permits.
#' 
#' To specify the principal, use the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of an AWS principal. Valid AWS principals include AWS accounts (root), IAM users, IAM roles, federated users, and assumed role users. For examples of the ARN syntax to use for specifying a principal, see [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-iam) in the Example ARNs section of the *AWS General Reference*.
#' @param RetiringPrincipal The principal that is given permission to retire the grant by using RetireGrant operation.
#' 
#' To specify the principal, use the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of an AWS principal. Valid AWS principals include AWS accounts (root), IAM users, federated users, and assumed role users. For examples of the ARN syntax to use for specifying a principal, see [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-iam) in the Example ARNs section of the *AWS General Reference*.
#' @param Operations &#91;required&#93; A list of operations that the grant permits.

For more information about encryption context, see [Encryption Context](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encryption-context.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param GrantTokens A list of grant tokens.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Grant Tokens](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#grant_token) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param Name A friendly name for identifying the grant. Use this value to prevent unintended creation of duplicate grants when retrying this request.
#' 
#' When this value is absent, all `CreateGrant` requests result in a new grant with a unique `GrantId` even if all the supplied parameters are identical. This can result in unintended duplicates when you retry the `CreateGrant` request.
#' 
#' When this value is present, you can retry a `CreateGrant` request with identical parameters; if the grant already exists, the original `GrantId` is returned without creating a new grant. Note that the returned grant token is unique with every `CreateGrant` request, even when a duplicate `GrantId` is returned. All grant tokens obtained in this way can be used interchangeably.

This reduces the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the [Default Key Policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam) section of the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' -   Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS.

#' You can use CMKs only for symmetric encryption and decryption.
#' @param Origin The source of the CMK\'s key material. You cannot change the origin after you create the CMK.
#' 
#' The default is `AWS_KMS`, which means AWS KMS creates the key material in its own key store.
#' 
#' When the parameter value is `EXTERNAL`, AWS KMS creates a CMK without key material so that you can import key material from your existing key management infrastructure. For more information about importing key material into AWS KMS, see [Importing Key Material](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' When the parameter value is `AWS_CLOUDHSM`, AWS KMS creates the CMK in a AWS KMS [custom key store](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html) and creates its key material in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.

#' Decrypts ciphertext
#'
#' Decrypts ciphertext. Ciphertext is plaintext that has been previously encrypted by using any of the following operations:
#' 
#' -   GenerateDataKey
#' 
#' -   GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
#' 
#' -   Encrypt
#' 
#' Note that if a caller has been granted access permissions to all keys (through, for example, IAM user policies that grant `Decrypt` permission on all resources), then ciphertext encrypted by using keys in other accounts where the key grants access to the caller can be decrypted. To remedy this, we recommend that you do not grant `Decrypt` access in an IAM user policy. Instead grant `Decrypt` access only in key policies. If you must grant `Decrypt` access in an IAM user policy, you should scope the resource to specific keys or to specific trusted accounts.
#'

#' 
#' The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any AWS KMS [customer master keys (CMKs)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys). Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use any of the CMKs in the key store for any cryptographic operations. Then, use ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) from the key store. When the scheduled waiting period expires, the `ScheduleKeyDeletion` operation deletes the CMKs. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually [delete the orphaned key material](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key) from the cluster and its backups.
#' 
#' After all CMKs are deleted from AWS KMS, use DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from AWS KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store.
#' 
#' Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect it from AWS KMS. While the key store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the CMKs in the key store. But, you do not need to delete CMKs and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key store at any time.

#' Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK)
#'
#' Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK). The `Encrypt` operation has two primary use cases:
#' 
#' -   You can encrypt up to 4 kilobytes (4096 bytes) of arbitrary data such as an RSA key, a database password, or other sensitive information.
#' 
#' -   To move encrypted data from one AWS region to another, you can use this operation to encrypt in the new region the plaintext data key that was used to encrypt the data in the original region. This provides you with an encrypted copy of the data key that can be decrypted in the new region and used there to decrypt the encrypted data.
#' 
#' To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
#' 
#' Unless you are moving encrypted data from one region to another, you don\'t use this operation to encrypt a generated data key within a region. To get data keys that are already encrypted, call the GenerateDataKey or GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext operation. Data keys don\'t need to be encrypted again by calling `Encrypt`.
#' 
#' To encrypt data locally in your application, use the GenerateDataKey operation to return a plaintext data encryption key and a copy of the key encrypted under the CMK of your choosing.
#' 
#' The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see [How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

#' Returns a data encryption key that you can use in your application to encrypt data locally
#'
#' Returns a data encryption key that you can use in your application to encrypt data locally.
#' 
#' You must specify the customer master key (CMK) under which to generate the data key. You must also specify the length of the data key using either the `KeySpec` or `NumberOfBytes` field. You must specify one field or the other, but not both. For common key lengths (128-bit and 256-bit symmetric keys), we recommend that you use `KeySpec`. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
#' 
#' This operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key in the `Plaintext` field of the response, and an encrypted copy of the data key in the `CiphertextBlob` field. The data key is encrypted under the CMK specified in the `KeyId` field of the request.
#' 
#' We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application:
#' 
#' 1.  Use this operation (`GenerateDataKey`) to get a data encryption key.
#' 
#' 2.  Use the plaintext data encryption key (returned in the `Plaintext` field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.
#' 
#' 3.  Store the encrypted data key (returned in the `CiphertextBlob` field of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.
#' 
#' To decrypt data locally:
#' 
#' 1.  Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key into a plaintext copy of the data key.
#' 
#' 2.  Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.
#' 
#' To return only an encrypted copy of the data key, use GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext. To return a random byte string that is cryptographically secure, use GenerateRandom.
#' 
#' If you use the optional `EncryptionContext` field, you must store at least enough information to be able to reconstruct the full encryption context when you later send the ciphertext to the Decrypt operation. It is a good practice to choose an encryption context that you can reconstruct on the fly to better secure the ciphertext. For more information, see [Encryption Context](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encryption-context.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

#' Returns a data encryption key encrypted under a customer master key (CMK)
#'
#' Returns a data encryption key encrypted under a customer master key (CMK). This operation is identical to GenerateDataKey but returns only the encrypted copy of the data key.
#' 
#' To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
#' 
#' This operation is useful in a system that has multiple components with different degrees of trust. For example, consider a system that stores encrypted data in containers. Each container stores the encrypted data and an encrypted copy of the data key. One component of the system, called the *control plane*, creates new containers. When it creates a new container, it uses this operation (`GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`) to get an encrypted data key and then stores it in the container. Later, a different component of the system, called the *data plane*, puts encrypted data into the containers. To do this, it passes the encrypted data key to the Decrypt operation, then uses the returned plaintext data key to encrypt data, and finally stores the encrypted data in the container. In this system, the control plane never sees the plaintext data key.

#' Imports key material into an existing AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) that was created without key material
#'
#' Imports key material into an existing AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) that was created without key material. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account. For more information about creating CMKs with no key material and then importing key material, see [Importing Key Material](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Before using this operation, call GetParametersForImport. Its response includes a public key and an import token. Use the public key to encrypt the key material. Then, submit the import token from the same `GetParametersForImport` response.
#' 
#' When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:
#' 
#' -   The key ID or key ARN of a CMK with no key material. Its `Origin` must be `EXTERNAL`.
#' 
#'     To create a CMK with no key material, call CreateKey and set the value of its `Origin` parameter to `EXTERNAL`. To get the `Origin` of a CMK, call DescribeKey.)
#' 
#' -   The encrypted key material. To get the public key to encrypt the key material, call GetParametersForImport.
#' 
#' -   The import token that GetParametersForImport returned. This token and the public key used to encrypt the key material must have come from the same response.
#' 
#' -   Whether the key material expires and if so, when. If you set an expiration date, you can change it only by reimporting the same key material and specifying a new expiration date. If the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the CMK becomes unusable. To use the CMK again, you must reimport the same key material.
#' 
#' When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes from `PendingImport` to `Enabled`, and you can use the CMK. After you successfully import key material into a CMK, you can reimport the same key material into that CMK, but you cannot import different key material.
#' 
#' The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see [How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

#' Encrypts data on the server side with a new customer master key (CMK) without exposing the plaintext of the data on the client side
#'
#' Encrypts data on the server side with a new customer master key (CMK) without exposing the plaintext of the data on the client side. The data is first decrypted and then reencrypted. You can also use this operation to change the encryption context of a ciphertext.
#' 
#' You can reencrypt data using CMKs in different AWS accounts.
#' 
#' Unlike other operations, `ReEncrypt` is authorized twice, once as `ReEncryptFrom` on the source CMK and once as `ReEncryptTo` on the destination CMK. We recommend that you include the `"kms:ReEncrypt*"` permission in your [key policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) to permit reencryption from or to the CMK. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you create a CMK through the console, but you must include it manually when you create a CMK programmatically or when you set a key policy with the PutKeyPolicy operation.
#' 
#' The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see [How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

#' Retires a grant
#'
#' Retires a grant. To clean up, you can retire a grant when you\'re done using it. You should revoke a grant when you intend to actively deny operations that depend on it. The following are permitted to call this API:
#' 
#' -   The AWS account (root user) under which the grant was created
#' 
#' -   The `RetiringPrincipal`, if present in the grant
#' 
#' -   The `GranteePrincipal`, if `RetireGrant` is an operation specified in the grant
#' 
#' You must identify the grant to retire by its grant token or by a combination of the grant ID and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer master key (CMK). A grant token is a unique variable-length base64-encoded string. A grant ID is a 64 character unique identifier of a grant. The CreateGrant operation returns both.

#' Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK)
#'
#' Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). You may provide a waiting period, specified in days, before deletion occurs. If you do not provide a waiting period, the default period of 30 days is used. When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes to `PendingDeletion`. Before the waiting period ends, you can use CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.
#' 
#' Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. To prevent the use of a CMK without deleting it, use DisableKey.
#' 
#' If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a [custom key store](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html), when the waiting period expires, `ScheduleKeyDeletion` deletes the CMK from AWS KMS. Then AWS KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually [delete the orphaned key material](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key) from the cluster and its backups.
#' 
#' You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.

#' Changes the properties of a custom key store
#'
#' Changes the properties of a custom key store. Use the `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter to identify the custom key store you want to edit. Use the remaining parameters to change the properties of the custom key store.
#' 
#' You can only update a custom key store that is disconnected. To disconnect the custom key store, use DisconnectCustomKeyStore. To reconnect the custom key store after the update completes, use ConnectCustomKeyStore. To find the connection state of a custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
#' 
#' Use the `NewCustomKeyStoreName` parameter to change the friendly name of the custom key store to the value that you specify.
#' 
#' Use the `KeyStorePassword` parameter tell AWS KMS the current password of the [`kmsuser` crypto user (CU)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser) in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. You can use this parameter to fix connection failures that occur when AWS KMS cannot log into the associated cluster because the `kmsuser` password has changed. This value does not change the password in the AWS CloudHSM cluster.
#' 
#' Use the `CloudHsmClusterId` parameter to associate the custom key store with a related AWS CloudHSM cluster, that is, a cluster that shares a backup history with the original cluster. You can use this parameter to repair a custom key store if its AWS CloudHSM cluster becomes corrupted or is deleted, or when you need to create or restore a cluster from a backup.
#' 
#' The cluster ID must identify a AWS CloudHSM cluster with the following requirements.
#' 
#' -   The cluster must be active and be in the same AWS account and Region as the custom key store.
#' 
#' -   The cluster must have the same cluster certificate as the original cluster. You cannot use this parameter to associate the custom key store with an unrelated cluster. To view the cluster certificate, use the AWS CloudHSM [DescribeClusters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html) operation. Clusters that share a backup history have the same cluster certificate.
#' 
#' -   The cluster must be configured with subnets in at least two different Availability Zones in the Region. Because AWS CloudHSM is not supported in all Availability Zones, we recommend that the cluster have subnets in all Availability Zones in the Region.
#' 
#' -   The cluster must contain at least two active HSMs, each in a different Availability Zone.
#' 
#' If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.
#' 
#' This operation is part of the [Custom Key Store feature](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html) feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

#' @param NewCustomKeyStoreName Changes the friendly name of the custom key store to the value that you specify. The custom key store name must be unique in the AWS account.
#' @param KeyStorePassword Enter the current password of the `kmsuser` crypto user (CU) in the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store.
#' 
#' This parameter tells AWS KMS the current password of the `kmsuser` crypto user (CU). It does not set or change the password of any users in the AWS CloudHSM cluster.
#' @param CloudHsmClusterId Associates the custom key store with a related AWS CloudHSM cluster.
#' 
#' Enter the cluster ID of the cluster that you used to create the custom key store or a cluster that shares a backup history with the original cluster. You cannot use this parameter to associate a custom key store with a different cluster.

#' Updates the description of a customer master key (CMK)
#'
#' Updates the description of a customer master key (CMK). To see the decription of a CMK, use DescribeKey.
#' 
#' You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.
#' 
#' The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see [How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

#'
#' @param KeyId &#91;required&#93; A unique identifier for the customer master key (CMK).
#' 
#' Specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.
#' 
#' For example:
#' 
#' -   Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
