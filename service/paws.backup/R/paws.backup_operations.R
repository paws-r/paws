#'
#' @param BackupPlan &#91;required&#93; Specifies the body of a backup plan. Includes a `BackupPlanName` and one or more sets of `Rules`.
#' @param BackupPlanTags To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair. The specified tags are assigned to all backups created with this plan.

#' Creates a JSON document that specifies a set of resources to assign to a backup plan
#'
#' Creates a JSON document that specifies a set of resources to assign to a backup plan. Resources can be included by specifying patterns for a `ListOfTags` and selected `Resources`.
#' 
#' For example, consider the following patterns:
#' 
#' -   `Resources: "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:volume/volume-id"`
#' 
#' -   `ConditionKey:"department"`
#' 
#'     `ConditionValue:"finance"`
#' 
#'     `ConditionType:"StringEquals"`
#' 
#' -   `ConditionKey:"importance"`
#' 
#'     `ConditionValue:"critical"`
#' 
#'     `ConditionType:"StringEquals"`
#' 
#' Using these patterns would back up all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are tagged as `"department=finance"`, `"importance=critical"`, in addition to an EBS volume with the specified volume Id.
#' 
#' Resources and conditions are additive in that all resources that match the pattern are selected. This shouldn\'t be confused with a logical AND, where all conditions must match. The matching patterns are logically \'put together using the OR operator. In other words, all patterns that match are selected for backup.

#'
#' @param BackupVaultName &#91;required&#93; The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the AWS Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
#' @param ResourceArn &#91;required&#93; An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.
#' @param IamRoleArn &#91;required&#93; Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access`.
#' @param IdempotencyToken A customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls to `StartBackupJob`. Idempotency tokens time out after one hour. Therefore, if you call `StartBackupJob` multiple times with the same idempotency token within one hour, AWS Backup recognizes that you are requesting only one backup job and initiates only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, AWS Backup recognizes that you are requesting to start multiple backups.
#' @param StartWindowMinutes The amount of time in minutes before beginning a backup.
#' @param CompleteWindowMinutes The amount of time AWS Backup attempts a backup before canceling the job and returning an error.
#' @param Lifecycle The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. AWS Backup will transition and expire backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.
#' 
#' Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the "expire after days" setting must be 90 days greater than the "transition to cold after days" setting. The "transition to cold after days" setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.
#' @param RecoveryPointTags To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair.

#' @param Metadata &#91;required&#93; A set of metadata key-value pairs. Lists the metadata that the recovery point was created with.
#' @param IamRoleArn &#91;required&#93; The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that AWS Backup uses to create the target recovery point; for example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access`.
