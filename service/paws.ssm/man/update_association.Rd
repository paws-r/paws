\usage{
update_association(AssociationId, Parameters = NULL,
  DocumentVersion = NULL, ScheduleExpression = NULL,
  OutputLocation = NULL, Name = NULL, Targets = NULL,
  AssociationName = NULL, AssociationVersion = NULL,
  AutomationTargetParameterName = NULL, MaxErrors = NULL,
  MaxConcurrency = NULL, ComplianceSeverity = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{AssociationId}{[required] The ID of the association you want to update.}

\item{Parameters}{The parameters you want to update for the association. If you create a parameter using Parameter Store, you can reference the parameter using {{ssm:parameter-name}}}

\item{DocumentVersion}{The document version you want update for the association.}

\item{ScheduleExpression}{The cron expression used to schedule the association that you want to update.}

\item{OutputLocation}{An Amazon S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request.}

\item{Name}{The name of the association document.}

\item{Targets}{The targets of the association.}

\item{AssociationName}{The name of the association that you want to update.}

\item{AssociationVersion}{This parameter is provided for concurrency control purposes. You must specify the latest association version in the service. If you want to ensure that this request succeeds, either specify \code{$LATEST}, or omit this parameter.}

\item{AutomationTargetParameterName}{Specify the target for the association. This target is required for associations that use an Automation document and target resources by using rate controls.}

\item{MaxErrors}{The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 instances and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received.

Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.}

\item{MaxConcurrency}{The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time.

If a new instance starts and attempts to execute an association while Systems Manager is executing MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new instance will process its association within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency.}

\item{ComplianceSeverity}{The severity level to assign to the association.}
