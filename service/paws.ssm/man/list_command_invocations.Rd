\description{
An invocation is copy of a command sent to a specific instance. A command can apply to one or more instances. A command invocation applies to one instance. For example, if a user executes SendCommand against three instances, then a command invocation is created for each requested instance ID. ListCommandInvocations provide status about command execution.
