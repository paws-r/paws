Description: AWS Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities
    that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system
    inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the
    creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating
    systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you
    remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed
    instances. A *managed instance* is any Amazon EC2 instance or
    on-premises machine in your hybrid environment that has been
    configured for Systems Manager.
