Description: This is the *AWS WAF Regional API Reference* for
    using AWS WAF with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Application Load
    Balancers. The AWS WAF actions and data types listed in the reference
    are available for protecting Application Load Balancers. You can use
    these actions and data types by means of the endpoints listed in [AWS
    Regions and

    This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the
    AWS WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information
    about AWS WAF features and an overview of how to use the AWS WAF API,
