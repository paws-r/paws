\title{Returns a list of existing service meshes}
\usage{
list_meshes(limit = NULL, nextToken = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{limit}{The maximum number of mesh results returned by \code{ListMeshes} in paginated output. When this parameter is used, \code{ListMeshes} only returns \code{limit} results in a single page along with a \code{nextToken} response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another \code{ListMeshes} request with the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then \code{ListMeshes} returns up to 100 results and a \code{nextToken} value if applicable.}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated \code{ListMeshes} request where \code{limit} was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the \code{nextToken} value.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.}
