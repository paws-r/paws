\title{Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video}
\usage{
start_label_detection(Video, ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  MinConfidence = NULL, NotificationChannel = NULL, JobTag = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Video}{[required] The video in which you want to detect labels. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use the same token with multiple \code{StartLabelDetection} requests, the same \code{JobId} is returned. Use \code{ClientRequestToken} to prevent the same job from being accidently started more than once.}

\item{MinConfidence}{Specifies the minimum confidence that Amazon Rekognition Video must have in order to return a detected label. Confidence represents how certain Amazon Rekognition is that a label is correctly identified.0 is the lowest confidence. 100 is the highest confidence. Amazon Rekognition Video doesn't return any labels with a confidence level lower than this specified value.

If you don't specify \code{MinConfidence}, the operation returns labels with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.}

\item{NotificationChannel}{The Amazon SNS topic ARN you want Amazon Rekognition Video to publish the completion status of the label detection operation to.}

\item{JobTag}{Unique identifier you specify to identify the job in the completion status published to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic.}
}
\description{
Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video.
}
\details{
Amazon Rekognition Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are instances of real-world entities. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; concepts like landscape, evening, and nature; and activities like a person getting out of a car or a person skiing.

The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Video to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. \code{StartLabelDetection} returns a job identifier (\code{JobId}) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in \code{NotificationChannel}.

To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is \code{SUCCEEDED}. If so, call GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (\code{JobId}) from the initial call to \code{StartLabelDetection}.
