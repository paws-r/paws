\title{Detects explicit or suggestive adult content in a specified JPEG or PNG format image}
\usage{
detect_moderation_labels(Image, MinConfidence = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Image}{[required] The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported.}

\item{MinConfidence}{Specifies the minimum confidence level for the labels to return. Amazon Rekognition doesn't return any labels with a confidence level lower than this specified value.

If you don't specify \code{MinConfidence}, the operation returns labels with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.}
}
\description{
Detects explicit or suggestive adult content in a specified JPEG or PNG format image. Use \code{DetectModerationLabels} to moderate images depending on your requirements. For example, you might want to filter images that contain nudity, but not images containing suggestive content.
}
\details{
To filter images, use the labels returned by \code{DetectModerationLabels} to determine which types of content are appropriate.

For information about moderation labels, see Detecting Unsafe Content in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.
