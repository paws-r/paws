#' Compares a face in the *source* input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the *target* input image
#'
#' Compares a face in the *source* input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the *target* input image.
#' 
#' If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.
#' 
#' You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn\'t supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.
#' 
#' In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match.
#' 
#' By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80\% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the `SimilarityThreshold` parameter.
#' 
#' `CompareFaces` also returns an array of faces that don\'t match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.
#' 
#' If the image doesn\'t contain Exif metadata, `CompareFaces` returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.
#' 
#' If no faces are detected in the source or target images, `CompareFaces` returns an `InvalidParameterException` error.
#' 
#' This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn\'t persist.

#' For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

#' Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input
#'
#' Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature.
#' 
#' For an example, see Analyzing Images Stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
#' 
#' `DetectLabels` does not support the detection of activities. However, activity detection is supported for label detection in videos. For more information, see StartLabelDetection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
#' 
#' You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.
#' 
#' For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object.
#' 
#' `{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}`
#' 
#' `{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}`
#' 
#' ` {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}`
#' 
#' In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels.
#' 
#' `{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}`
#' 
#' `{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}`
#' 
#' `{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}`
#' 
#' In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.
#' 
#' In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify `MinConfidence` to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 50\%. You can also add the `MaxLabels` parameter to limit the number of labels returned.
#' 
#' If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn\'t provide the same facial details that the DetectFaces operation provides.
#' 
#' `DetectLabels` returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in an array of objects. An `Instance` object contains a object, for the location of the label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected.
#' 
#' `DetectLabels` also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label *car*. The label *car* has two parent labels: *Vehicle* (its parent) and *Transportation* (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label. Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, *Car*, *Vehicle*, and *Transportation* are returned as unique labels in the response.

#' The `DetectText` operation returns text in an array of elements, `TextDetections`. Each `TextDetection` element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image.
#' 
#' A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not separated by spaces. `DetectText` can detect up to 50 words in an image.
#' 
#' A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn\'t necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver\'s license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don\'t represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the `DetectText` operation returns multiple lines.

#' Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.
#' 
#' Amazon Rekognition doesn\'t save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the and operations.
#' 
#' For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
#' 
#' To get the number of faces in a collection, call .
#' 
#' If you\'re using version 1.0 of the face detection model, `IndexFaces` indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.
#' 
#' If you\'re using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the `OrientationCorrection` field.
#' 
#' To determine which version of the model you\'re using, call and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of `FaceModelVersion` in the response from `IndexFaces`
#' 
#' For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
#' 
#' If you provide the optional `ExternalImageID` for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image.
#' 
#' You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the `MaxFaces` input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don\'t want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background.
#' 
#' The `QualityFilter` input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don't meet the required quality bar chosen by Amazon Rekognition. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, `IndexFaces` filters detected faces. You can also explicitly filter detected faces by specifying `AUTO` for the value of `QualityFilter`. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify `NONE`.
#' 
#' To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call .
#' 
#' Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of objects, `UnindexedFaces`. Faces aren\'t indexed for reasons such as:
#' 
#' -   The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the `MaxFaces` request parameter.
#' 
#' -   The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.
#' 
#' -   The face is too blurry.
#' 
#' -   The image is too dark.
#' 
#' -   The face has an extreme pose.
#' 
#' In response, the `IndexFaces` operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, `FaceRecords`. This includes:
#' 
#' -   The bounding box, `BoundingBox`, of the detected face.
#' 
#' -   A confidence value, `Confidence`, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.
#' 
#' -   A face ID, `faceId`, assigned by the service for each face that\'s detected and stored.
#' 
#' -   An image ID, `ImageId`, assigned by the service for the input image.
#' 
#' If you request all facial attributes (by using the `detectionAttributes` parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other facial attributes like gender. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the `IndexFaces` operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn\'t save duplicate face metadata.
#' 
#' The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn\'t supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.

If you provide `["ALL"]`, all facial attributes are returned, but the operation takes longer to complete.
#' 
#' If you provide both, `["ALL", "DEFAULT"]`, the service uses a logical AND operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all attributes).
#' @param MaxFaces The maximum number of faces to index. The value of `MaxFaces` must be greater than or equal to 1. `IndexFaces` returns no more than 100 detected faces in an image, even if you specify a larger value for `MaxFaces`.
#' 
#' If `IndexFaces` detects more faces than the value of `MaxFaces`, the faces with the lowest quality are filtered out first. If there are still more faces than the value of `MaxFaces`, the faces with the smallest bounding boxes are filtered out (up to the number that\'s needed to satisfy the value of `MaxFaces`). Information about the unindexed faces is available in the `UnindexedFaces` array.
#'

If you specify `AUTO`, filtering prioritizes the identification of faces that don't meet the required quality bar chosen by Amazon Rekognition. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that\'s misidentified as a face, a face that\'s too blurry, or a face with a pose that\'s too extreme to use. If you specify `NONE`, no filtering is performed. The default value is AUTO.
#' 
#' To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model.
