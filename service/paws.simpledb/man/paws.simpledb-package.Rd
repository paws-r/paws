\title{paws.simpledb: Amazon SimpleDB}
\description{
Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the
    core database functions of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By
    offloading the time and effort associated with building and operating
    a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides developers the freedom to
    focus on application development. <p> A traditional, clustered
    relational database requires a sizable upfront capital outlay, is
    complex to design, and often requires extensive and repetitive
    database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler,
    requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and providing a
    simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates the
    administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and
    performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality
    within Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale
    instantly, and pay only for what they use. </p> <p> Visit <a
