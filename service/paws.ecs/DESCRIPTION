Description: Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a
    highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy
    to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host
    your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon
    ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type.
    For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon
    Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using
    the EC2 launch type. For more information about launch types, see
    [Amazon ECS Launch
    Types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html).
