\title{Lists the services that are running in a specified cluster}
\usage{
list_services(cluster = NULL, nextToken = NULL, maxResults = NULL,
  launchType = NULL, schedulingStrategy = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster}{The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the services to list. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated \code{ListServices} request where \code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the \code{nextToken} value.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of service results returned by \code{ListServices} in paginated output. When this parameter is used, \code{ListServices} only returns \code{maxResults} results in a single page along with a \code{nextToken} response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another \code{ListServices} request with the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then \code{ListServices} returns up to 10 results and a \code{nextToken} value if applicable.}

\item{launchType}{The launch type for the services to list.}

\item{schedulingStrategy}{The scheduling strategy for services to list.}
}
