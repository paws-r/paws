#' Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster
#'
#' Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a `default` cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the `CreateCluster` action.
#' 
#' When you call the CreateCluster API operation, Amazon ECS attempts to create the service-linked role for your account so that required resources in other AWS services can be managed on your behalf. However, if the IAM user that makes the call does not have permissions to create the service-linked role, it is not created. For more information, see [Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

#' ```
#'
#' @param clusterName The name of your cluster. If you do not specify a name for your cluster, you create a cluster named `default`. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.

#' Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition
#'
#' Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below `desiredCount`, Amazon ECS spawns another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see UpdateService.
#' 
#' In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see [Service Load Balancing](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. During a deployment, the service scheduler uses the `minimumHealthyPercent` and `maximumPercent` parameters to determine the deployment strategy. The deployment is triggered by changing the task definition or the desired count of a service with an UpdateService operation.
#' 
#' The `minimumHealthyPercent` represents a lower limit on the number of your service\'s tasks that must remain in the `RUNNING` state during a deployment, as a percentage of the `desiredCount` (rounded up to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a `desiredCount` of four tasks and a `minimumHealthyPercent` of 50\%, the scheduler can stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that *do not* use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the `RUNNING` state. Tasks for services that *do* use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the `RUNNING` state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for a replica service for `minimumHealthyPercent` is 50\% in the console and 100\% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs. The default value for a daemon service for `minimumHealthyPercent` is 0\% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs and 50\% for the console.
#' 
#' The `maximumPercent` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of your service\'s tasks that are allowed in the `RUNNING` or `PENDING` state during a deployment, as a percentage of the `desiredCount` (rounded down to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your replica service has a `desiredCount` of four tasks and a `maximumPercent` value of 200\%, the scheduler can start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for a replica service for `maximumPercent` is 200\%. If you are using a daemon service type, the `maximumPercent` should remain at 100\%, which is the default value.
#' 
#' When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:
#' 
#' -   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service\'s task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
#' 
#' -   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the `placementStrategy` parameter):
#' 
#'     -   Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.
#' 
#'     -   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.

#' ```
#'
#' @param cluster The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which to run your service. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
#' @param serviceName &#91;required&#93; The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions.
#' @param taskDefinition &#91;required&#93; The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a `revision` is not specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.
#' @param loadBalancers A load balancer object representing the load balancer to use with your service. Currently, you are limited to one load balancer or target group per service. After you create a service, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable.
#' 
#' For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer specified here.
#' 
#' For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group specified here.
#' 
#' Services with tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers; Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose `ip` as the target type, not `instance`, because tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.
#' @param serviceRegistries The details of the service discovery registries to assign to this service. For more information, see [Service Discovery](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html).
#' 
#' Service discovery is supported for Fargate tasks if using platform version v1.1.0 or later. For more information, see [AWS Fargate Platform Versions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).
#' @param desiredCount The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place and keep running on your cluster.
#' @param clientToken Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. Up to 32 ASCII characters are allowed.
#' @param launchType The launch type on which to run your service.
#' @param platformVersion The platform version on which to run your service. If one is not specified, the latest version is used by default.
#' @param role The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your service and your task definition does not use the `awsvpc` network mode. If you specify the `role` parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the `loadBalancers` parameter.
#' 
#' If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the `awsvpc` network mode, in which case you should not specify a role here. For more information, see [Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path of `/foo/` then you would specify `/foo/bar` as the role name. For more information, see [Friendly Names and Paths](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names) in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param deploymentConfiguration Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
#' @param placementConstraints An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task (this limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at run time).
#' @param placementStrategy The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per service.
#' @param networkConfiguration The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own Elastic Network Interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information, see [Task Networking](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service\'s tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 7,200 seconds during which the ECS service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
#' @param schedulingStrategy The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information, see [Services](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguideecs_services.html).
#' 
#' There are two service scheduler strategies available:
#' 
#' -   `REPLICA`-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions.
#' 
#' -   `DAEMON`-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. When using this strategy, there is no need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.
#' 
#'     Fargate tasks do not support the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy.
#'

#' Deletes a specified service within a cluster
#'
#' Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the service is actively maintaining tasks, you cannot delete it, and you must update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information, see UpdateService.
#' 
#' When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from `ACTIVE` to `DRAINING`, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in ListServices API operations. After the tasks have stopped, then the service status moves from `DRAINING` to `INACTIVE`. Services in the `DRAINING` or `INACTIVE` status can still be viewed with DescribeServices API operations. However, in the future, `INACTIVE` services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and DescribeServices API operations on those services return a `ServiceNotFoundException` error.
#' 
#' If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing service in either `ACTIVE` or `DRAINING` status, you will receive an error.

#' Deregisters an Amazon ECS container instance from the specified cluster
#'
#' Deregisters an Amazon ECS container instance from the specified cluster. This instance is no longer available to run tasks.
#' 
#' If you intend to use the container instance for some other purpose after deregistration, you should stop all of the tasks running on the container instance before deregistration. That prevents any orphaned tasks from consuming resources.
#' 
#' Deregistering a container instance removes the instance from a cluster, but it does not terminate the EC2 instance; if you are finished using the instance, be sure to terminate it in the Amazon EC2 console to stop billing.
#' 
#' If you terminate a running container instance, Amazon ECS automatically deregisters the instance from your cluster (stopped container instances or instances with disconnected agents are not automatically deregistered when terminated).
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```
#' deregister_container_instance(
#'   cluster = "string",
#'   containerInstance = "string",
#'   force = TRUE|FALSE
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param cluster The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the container instance to deregister. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
#' @param containerInstance &#91;required&#93; The container instance ID or full ARN of the container instance to deregister. The ARN contains the `arn:aws:ecs` namespace, followed by the Region of the container instance, the AWS account ID of the container instance owner, the `container-instance` namespace, and then the container instance ID. For example, `arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:container-instance/container_instance_ID region:aws_account_id:container-instance/container_instance_ID `.
#' @param force Forces the deregistration of the container instance. If you have tasks running on the container instance when you deregister it with the `force` option, these tasks remain running until you terminate the instance or the tasks stop through some other means, but they are orphaned (no longer monitored or accounted for by Amazon ECS). If an orphaned task on your container instance is part of an Amazon ECS service, then the service scheduler starts another copy of that task, on a different container instance if possible.
#' 
#' Any containers in orphaned service tasks that are registered with a Classic Load Balancer or an Application Load Balancer target group are deregistered. They begin connection draining according to the settings on the load balancer or target group.
#'
#' @examples
#' # This example deregisters a container instance from the specified cluster

#' Deregisters the specified task definition by family and revision
#'
#' Deregisters the specified task definition by family and revision. Upon deregistration, the task definition is marked as `INACTIVE`. Existing tasks and services that reference an `INACTIVE` task definition continue to run without disruption. Existing services that reference an `INACTIVE` task definition can still scale up or down by modifying the service\'s desired count.
#' 
#' You cannot use an `INACTIVE` task definition to run new tasks or create new services, and you cannot update an existing service to reference an `INACTIVE` task definition (although there may be up to a 10-minute window following deregistration where these restrictions have not yet taken effect).
#' 
#' At this time, `INACTIVE` task definitions remain discoverable in your account indefinitely; however, this behavior is subject to change in the future, so you should not rely on `INACTIVE` task definitions persisting beyond the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services.

#' @param desiredStatus The task desired status with which to filter the `ListTasks` results. Specifying a `desiredStatus` of `STOPPED` limits the results to tasks that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to `STOPPED`, which can be useful for debugging tasks that are not starting properly or have died or finished. The default status filter is `RUNNING`, which shows tasks that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to `RUNNING`.

#' Registers a new task definition from the supplied family and containerDefinitions
#'
#' Registers a new task definition from the supplied `family` and `containerDefinitions`. Optionally, you can add data volumes to your containers with the `volumes` parameter. For more information about task definition parameters and defaults, see [Amazon ECS Task Definitions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_defintions.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' You can specify an IAM role for your task with the `taskRoleArn` parameter. When you specify an IAM role for a task, its containers can then use the latest versions of the AWS CLI or SDKs to make API requests to the AWS services that are specified in the IAM policy associated with the role. For more information, see [IAM Roles for Tasks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' You can specify a Docker networking mode for the containers in your task definition with the `networkMode` parameter. The available network modes correspond to those described in [Network settings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/network-settings) in the Docker run reference. If you specify the `awsvpc` network mode, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration when you create a service or run a task with the task definition.

#'
#' @param family &#91;required&#93; You must specify a `family` for a task definition, which allows you to track multiple versions of the same task definition. The `family` is used as a name for your task definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
#' @param taskRoleArn The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that containers in this task can assume. All containers in this task are granted the permissions that are specified in this role. For more information, see [IAM Roles for Tasks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param executionRoleArn The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that the Amazon ECS container agent and the Docker daemon can assume.
#' @param networkMode The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are `none`, `bridge`, `awsvpc`, and `host`. The default Docker network mode is `bridge`. If using the Fargate launch type, the `awsvpc` network mode is required. If using the EC2 launch type, any network mode can be used. If the network mode is set to `none`, you can\'t specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the task\'s containers do not have external connectivity. The `host` and `awsvpc` network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the `bridge` mode.
#' 
#' With the `host` and `awsvpc` network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the `host` network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the `awsvpc` network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.
#' 
#' If the network mode is `awsvpc`, the task is allocated an Elastic Network Interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see [Task Networking](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' If the network mode is `host`, you can\'t run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used.
#' 
#' Docker for Windows uses different network modes than Docker for Linux. When you register a task definition with Windows containers, you must not specify a network mode.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Network settings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings) in the *Docker run reference*.
#' @param containerDefinitions &#91;required&#93; A list of container definitions in JSON format that describe the different containers that make up your task.
#' @param volumes A list of volume definitions in JSON format that containers in your task may use.
#' @param placementConstraints An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints per task (this limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at run time).
#' @param requiresCompatibilities The launch type required by the task. If no value is specified, it defaults to `EC2`.
#' @param cpu The number of CPU units used by the task. It can be expressed as an integer using CPU units, for example `1024`, or as a string using vCPUs, for example `1 vCPU` or `1 vcpu`, in a task definition. String values are converted to an integer indicating the CPU units when the task definition is registered.
#' 
#' Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows containers.
#' 
#' If using the EC2 launch type, this field is optional. Supported values are between `128` CPU units (`0.125` vCPUs) and `10240` CPU units (`10` vCPUs).
#' 
#' If using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and you must use one of the following values, which determines your range of supported values for the `memory` parameter:
#' 
#' -   256 (.25 vCPU) - Available `memory` values: 512 (0.5 GB), 1024 (1 GB), 2048 (2 GB)
#'

#' 
#' -   1024 (1 vCPU) - Available `memory` values: 2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB), 7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB)
#' 
#' -   2048 (2 vCPU) - Available `memory` values: Between 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB)
#' 
#' -   4096 (4 vCPU) - Available `memory` values: Between 8192 (8 GB) and 30720 (30 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB)
#' @param memory The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task. It can be expressed as an integer using MiB, for example `1024`, or as a string using GB, for example `1GB` or `1 GB`, in a task definition. String values are converted to an integer indicating the MiB when the task definition is registered.

#' Starts a new task using the specified task definition.
#' 
#' You can allow Amazon ECS to place tasks for you, or you can customize how Amazon ECS places tasks using placement constraints and placement strategies. For more information, see [Scheduling Tasks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Alternatively, you can use StartTask to use your own scheduler or place tasks manually on specific container instances.
#' 
#' The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model, due to the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. You should keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command.
#' 
#' To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:
#' 
#' -   Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait time.
#' 
#' -   Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting with a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait time.

#' 
#' A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit includes the JSON formatting characters of the override structure.
#' @param count The number of instantiations of the specified task to place on your cluster. You can specify up to 10 tasks per call.
#' @param startedBy An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example if you automatically trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply a unique identifier for that job to your task with the `startedBy` parameter. You can then identify which tasks belong to that job by filtering the results of a ListTasks call with the `startedBy` value. Up to 36 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
#' 
#' If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the `startedBy` parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.
#' @param group The name of the task group to associate with the task. The default value is the family name of the task definition (for example, family:my-family-name).
#' @param placementConstraints An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can specify up to 10 constraints per task (including constraints in the task definition and those specified at run time).
#' @param placementStrategy The placement strategy objects to use for the task. You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per task.
#' @param launchType The launch type on which to run your task.
#' @param platformVersion The platform version on which to run your task. If one is not specified, the latest version is used by default.
#' @param networkConfiguration The network configuration for the task.

#' Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance
#'
#' Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance.
#' 
#' You can change the status of a container instance to `DRAINING` to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.
#' 
#' When you set a container instance to `DRAINING`, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the `PENDING` state are stopped immediately.
#' 
#' Service tasks on the container instance that are in the `RUNNING` state are stopped and replaced according to the service\'s deployment configuration parameters, `minimumHealthyPercent` and `maximumPercent`. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using UpdateService.
#' 
#' -   If `minimumHealthyPercent` is below 100\%, the scheduler can ignore `desiredCount` temporarily during task replacement. For example, `desiredCount` is four tasks, a minimum of 50\% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100\%, the service scheduler can\'t remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the `RUNNING` state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the `RUNNING` state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.
#' 
#' -   The `maximumPercent` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch size. For example, if `desiredCount` of four tasks, a maximum of 200\% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). If the maximum is 100\%, then replacement tasks can\'t start until the draining tasks have stopped.
#' 
#' Any `PENDING` or `RUNNING` tasks that do not belong to a service are not affected; you must wait for them to finish or stop them manually.
#' 
#' A container instance has completed draining when it has no more `RUNNING` tasks. You can verify this using ListTasks.
#' 
#' When you set a container instance to `ACTIVE`, the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

#' Modifies the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, or task definition used in a service
#'
#' Modifies the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, or task definition used in a service.
#' 
#' You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new `desiredCount` parameter.
#' 
#' If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service\'s deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.
#' 
#' If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, `my_image:latest`), you do not need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the `forceNewDeployment` option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start.
#' 
#' You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, `minimumHealthyPercent` and `maximumPercent`, to determine the deployment strategy.
#' 
#' -   If `minimumHealthyPercent` is below 100\%, the scheduler can ignore `desiredCount` temporarily during a deployment. For example, if `desiredCount` is four tasks, a minimum of 50\% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the `RUNNING` state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the `RUNNING` state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.
#' 
#' -   The `maximumPercent` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if `desiredCount` is four tasks, a maximum of 200\% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).
#' 
#' When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of `docker stop` is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a `SIGTERM` and a 30-second timeout, after which `SIGKILL` is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the `SIGTERM` gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no `SIGKILL` is sent.
#' 
#' When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic:
#' 
#' -   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service\'s task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
#' 
#' -   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy):
#' 
#'     -   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.
#' 
#'     -   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.
#' 
#' When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic:
#' 
#' -   Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.
#' 
#' -   Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.

#' @param cluster The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that your service is running on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
#' @param service &#91;required&#93; The name of the service to update.
#' @param desiredCount The number of instantiations of the task to place and keep running in your service.
#' @param taskDefinition The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a `revision` is not specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used. If you modify the task definition with `UpdateService`, Amazon ECS spawns a task with the new version of the task definition and then stops an old task after the new version is running.
#' @param deploymentConfiguration Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
#' @param networkConfiguration The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own elastic network interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information, see [Task Networking](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Updating a service to add a subnet to a list of existing subnets does not trigger a service deployment. For example, if your network configuration change is to keep the existing subnets and simply add another subnet to the network configuration, this does not trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param platformVersion The platform version that your service should run.
#' @param forceNewDeployment Whether to force a new deployment of the service. Deployments are not forced by default. You can use this option to trigger a new deployment with no service definition changes. For example, you can update a service\'s tasks to use a newer Docker image with the same image/tag combination (`my_image:latest`) or to roll Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version.
#' @param healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service\'s tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 1,800 seconds during which the ECS service scheduler ignores the Elastic Load Balancing health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
