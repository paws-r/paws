Description: This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift.
    It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line
    interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that
    Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may
    require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers,
    to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the
    parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied
    immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next
    maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster
    management interfaces, go to [Using the Amazon Redshift Management
    Interfaces](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html).
