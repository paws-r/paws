\title{Returns a list of tags}
\usage{
describe_tags(ResourceName = NULL, ResourceType = NULL,
  MaxRecords = NULL, Marker = NULL, TagKeys = NULL,
  TagValues = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ResourceName}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for which you want to describe the tag or tags. For example, \code{arn:aws:redshift:us-east-1:123456789:cluster:t1}.}

\item{ResourceType}{The type of resource with which you want to view tags. Valid resource types are:
\itemize{
\item Cluster
\item CIDR/IP
\item EC2 security group
\item Snapshot
\item Cluster security group
\item Subnet group
\item HSM connection
\item HSM certificate
\item Parameter group
\item Snapshot copy grant
}

For more information about Amazon Redshift resource types and constructing ARNs, go to \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-access-control-overview.html#redshift-iam-access-control-specify-actions}{Specifying Policy Elements: Actions, Effects, Resources, and Principals} in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.}

\item{MaxRecords}{The maximum number or response records to return in each call. If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified \code{MaxRecords} value, a value is returned in a \code{marker} field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned \code{marker} value.}

\item{Marker}{A value that indicates the starting point for the next set of response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this returned marker value in the \code{marker} parameter and retrying the command. If the \code{marker} field is empty, all response records have been retrieved for the request.}

\item{TagKeys}{A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching resources that are associated with the specified key or keys. For example, suppose that you have resources tagged with keys called \code{owner} and \code{environment}. If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with all resources that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.}

\item{TagValues}{A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching resources that are associated with the specified value or values. For example, suppose that you have resources tagged with values called \code{admin} and \code{test}. If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with all resources that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.}

\description{
Returns a list of tags. You can return tags from a specific resource by specifying an ARN, or you can return all tags for a given type of resource, such as clusters, snapshots, and so on.
}
\details{
The following are limitations for \code{DescribeTags}:
\itemize{
\item You cannot specify an ARN and a resource-type value together in the same request.
\item You cannot use the \code{MaxRecords} and \code{Marker} parameters together with the ARN parameter.
\item The \code{MaxRecords} parameter can be a range from 10 to 50 results to return in a request.
}

If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all resources that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have \code{owner} and \code{environment} for tag keys, and \code{admin} and \code{test} for tag values, all resources that have any combination of those values are returned.

If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, resources are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.
