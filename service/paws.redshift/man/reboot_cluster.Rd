\description{
Reboots a cluster. This action is taken as soon as possible. It results in a momentary outage to the cluster, during which the cluster status is set to \code{rebooting}. A cluster event is created when the reboot is completed. Any pending cluster modifications (see ModifyCluster) are applied at this reboot. For more information about managing clusters, go to \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html}{Amazon Redshift Clusters} in the \emph{Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide}.
