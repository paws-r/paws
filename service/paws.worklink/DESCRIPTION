Description: Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that
    provides secure access to internal websites and web apps from iOS
    phones. In a single step, your users, such as employees, can access
    internal websites as efficiently as they access any other public
    website. They enter a URL in their web browser, or choose a link to an
    internal website in an email. Amazon WorkLink authenticates the
    user\'s access and securely renders authorized internal web content in
    a secure rendering service in the AWS cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn\'t
    download or store any internal web content on mobile devices.
