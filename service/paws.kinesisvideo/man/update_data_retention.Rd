\title{Increases or decreases the stream's data retention period by the value that you specify}
\usage{
update_data_retention(StreamName = NULL, StreamARN = NULL,
  CurrentVersion, Operation, DataRetentionChangeInHours)
}
\arguments{
\item{StreamName}{The name of the stream whose retention period you want to change.}

\item{StreamARN}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream whose retention period you want to change.}

\item{CurrentVersion}{[required] The version of the stream whose retention period you want to change. To get the version, call either the \code{DescribeStream} or the \code{ListStreams} API.}

\item{Operation}{[required] Indicates whether you want to increase or decrease the retention period.}

\item{DataRetentionChangeInHours}{[required] The retention period, in hours. The value you specify replaces the current value.}
}
\description{
Increases or decreases the stream's data retention period by the value that you specify. To indicate whether you want to increase or decrease the data retention period, specify the \code{Operation} parameter in the request body. In the request, you must specify either the \code{StreamName} or the \code{StreamARN}.
}
\details{
The retention period that you specify replaces the current value.

This operation requires permission for the \code{KinesisVideo:UpdateDataRetention} action.

Changing the data retention period affects the data in the stream as follows:
\itemize{
\item If the data retention period is increased, existing data is retained for the new retention period. For example, if the data retention period is increased from one hour to seven hours, all existing data is retained for seven hours.
\item If the data retention period is decreased, existing data is retained for the new retention period. For example, if the data retention period is decreased from seven hours to one hour, all existing data is retained for one hour, and any data older than one hour is deleted immediately.
}
