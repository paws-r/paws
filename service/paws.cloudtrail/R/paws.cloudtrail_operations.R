#' Adds one or more tags to a trail, up to a limit of 50
#'
#' Adds one or more tags to a trail, up to a limit of 50. Tags must be unique per trail. Overwrites an existing tag\'s value when a new value is specified for an existing tag key. If you specify a key without a value, the tag will be created with the specified key and a value of null. You can tag a trail that applies to all regions only from the region in which the trail was created (that is, from its home region).

#' Creates a trail that specifies the settings for delivery of log data to an Amazon S3 bucket
#'
#' Creates a trail that specifies the settings for delivery of log data to an Amazon S3 bucket. A maximum of five trails can exist in a region, irrespective of the region in which they were created.
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```
#' create_trail(
#'   Name = "string",
#'   S3BucketName = "string",
#'   S3KeyPrefix = "string",
#'   SnsTopicName = "string",
#'   IncludeGlobalServiceEvents = TRUE|FALSE,

#'   CloudWatchLogsRoleArn = "string",
#'   KmsKeyId = "string",
#'   IsOrganizationTrail = TRUE|FALSE
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; Specifies the name of the trail. The name must meet the following requirements:
#' 
#' -   Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (\_), or dashes (-)
#' 
#' -   Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number
#' 
#' -   Be between 3 and 128 characters
#' 
#' -   Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like `my-_namespace` and `my--namespace` are invalid.
#' 
#' -   Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)
#' @param S3BucketName &#91;required&#93; Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing log files. See [Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/create_trail_naming_policy.html).
#' @param S3KeyPrefix Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see [Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-find-log-files.html). The maximum length is 200 characters.
#' @param SnsTopicName Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
#' @param IncludeGlobalServiceEvents Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services such as IAM to the log files.
#' @param IsMultiRegionTrail Specifies whether the trail is created in the current region or in all regions. The default is false.
#' @param EnableLogFileValidation Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled. The default is false.
#' 
#' When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail will not create digest files for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.
#' @param CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered. Not required unless you specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn.
#' @param CloudWatchLogsRoleArn Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write to a user\'s log group.
#' @param KmsKeyId Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by \"alias/\", a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.
#' 
#' Examples:
#' 
#' -   alias/MyAliasName
#' 
#' -   arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
#' 
#' -   arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
#' 
#' -   12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
#' @param IsOrganizationTrail Specifies whether the trail is created for all accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations, or only for the current AWS account. The default is false, and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an AWS account that is the master account for an organization in AWS Organizations.

#' Returns all public keys whose private keys were used to sign the digest files within the specified time range
#'
#' Returns all public keys whose private keys were used to sign the digest files within the specified time range. The public key is needed to validate digest files that were signed with its corresponding private key.
#' 
#' CloudTrail uses different private/public key pairs per region. Each digest file is signed with a private key unique to its region. Therefore, when you validate a digest file from a particular region, you must look in the same region for its corresponding public key.

#' Configures an event selector for your trail
#'
#' Configures an event selector for your trail. Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events.
#' 
#' When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn\'t match any event selector, the trail doesn\'t log the event.
#' 
#' Example
#' 
#' 1.  You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events.
#' 
#' 2.  The EC2 `GetConsoleOutput` and `RunInstances` API operations occur in your account.
#' 
#' 3.  CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.
#' 
#' 4.  The `RunInstances` is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.
#' 
#' 5.  The `GetConsoleOutput` is a read-only event but it doesn\'t match your event selector. The trail doesn\'t log the event.
#' 
#' The `PutEventSelectors` operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an `InvalidHomeRegionException` is thrown.
#' 
#' You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more information, see [Logging Data and Management Events for Trails](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) and [Limits in AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*.

#' Suspends the recording of AWS API calls and log file delivery for the specified trail
#'
#' Suspends the recording of AWS API calls and log file delivery for the specified trail. Under most circumstances, there is no need to use this action. You can update a trail without stopping it first. This action is the only way to stop recording. For a trail enabled in all regions, this operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created, or an `InvalidHomeRegionException` will occur. This operation cannot be called on the shadow trails (replicated trails in other regions) of a trail enabled in all regions.
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```
#' stop_logging(
#'   Name = "string"
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; Specifies the name or the CloudTrail ARN of the trail for which CloudTrail will stop logging AWS API calls. The format of a trail ARN is:
#' 
#' `arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail`
#'
#' @export

#' Updates the settings that specify delivery of log files
#'
#' Updates the settings that specify delivery of log files. Changes to a trail do not require stopping the CloudTrail service. Use this action to designate an existing bucket for log delivery. If the existing bucket has previously been a target for CloudTrail log files, an IAM policy exists for the bucket. `UpdateTrail` must be called from the region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an `InvalidHomeRegionException` is thrown.
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```
#' update_trail(
#'   Name = "string",
#'   S3BucketName = "string",
#'   S3KeyPrefix = "string",
#'   SnsTopicName = "string",
#'   IncludeGlobalServiceEvents = TRUE|FALSE,
#'   IsMultiRegionTrail = TRUE|FALSE,
#'   EnableLogFileValidation = TRUE|FALSE,
#'   CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn = "string",
#'   CloudWatchLogsRoleArn = "string",
#'   KmsKeyId = "string",
#'   IsOrganizationTrail = TRUE|FALSE
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If `Name` is a trail name, the string must meet the following requirements:
#' 
#' -   Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (\_), or dashes (-)
#' 
#' -   Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number
#' 
#' -   Be between 3 and 128 characters
#' 
#' -   Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like `my-_namespace` and `my--namespace` are invalid.
#' 
#' -   Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)
#' 
#' If `Name` is a trail ARN, it must be in the format:
#' 
#' `arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail`
#' @param S3BucketName Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing log files. See [Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/create_trail_naming_policy.html).
#' @param S3KeyPrefix Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see [Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-find-log-files.html). The maximum length is 200 characters.
#' @param SnsTopicName Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
#' @param IncludeGlobalServiceEvents Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services such as IAM to the log files.
#' @param IsMultiRegionTrail Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current region or to all regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only in the current region and this value is set to true, shadow trails (replications of the trail) will be created in the other regions. If the trail exists in all regions and this value is set to false, the trail will remain in the region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other regions will be deleted.
#' @param EnableLogFileValidation Specifies whether log file validation is enabled. The default is false.
#' 
#' When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail will not create digest files for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.
#' @param CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered. Not required unless you specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn.
#' @param CloudWatchLogsRoleArn Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write to a user\'s log group.
#' @param KmsKeyId Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by \"alias/\", a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.
#' 
#' Examples:
#' 
#' -   alias/MyAliasName
#' 
#' -   arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
#' 
#' -   arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
#' 
#' -   12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
#' @param IsOrganizationTrail Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations, or only for the current AWS account. The default is false, and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an AWS account that is the master account for an organization in AWS Organizations. If the trail is not an organization trail and this is set to true, the trail will be created in all AWS accounts that belong to the organization. If the trail is an organization trail and this is set to false, the trail will remain in the current AWS account but be deleted from all member accounts in the organization.
