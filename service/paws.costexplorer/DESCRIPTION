Description: The Cost Explorer API enables you to
    programmatically query your cost and usage data. You can query for
    aggregated data such as total monthly costs or total daily usage. You
    can also query for granular data, such as the number of daily write
    operations for Amazon DynamoDB database tables in your production
    environment.
