Description: The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web
    service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege
    credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for
    users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides
    descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed information about using
    this service, go to [Temporary Security
    Credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html).
