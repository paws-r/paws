\title{paws.cloudformation: AWS CloudFormation}
\description{
AWS CloudFormation allows you to create and manage
    AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use
    AWS CloudFormation to leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic
    Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification
    Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build
    highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without
    creating or configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.
