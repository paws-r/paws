Description: Amazon API Gateway helps developers deliver robust,
    secure, and scalable mobile and web application back ends. API Gateway
    allows developers to securely connect mobile and web applications to
    APIs that run on AWS Lambda, Amazon EC2, or other publicly addressable
    web services that are hosted outside of AWS.
