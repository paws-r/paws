This is the *AWS WAF API Reference* for using AWS
    WAF with Amazon CloudFront. The AWS WAF actions and data types listed
    in the reference are available for protecting Amazon CloudFront
    distributions. You can use these actions and data types via the
    endpoint *waf.amazonaws.com*. This guide is for developers who need
    detailed information about the AWS WAF API actions, data types, and
    errors. For detailed information about AWS WAF features and an
    overview of how to use the AWS WAF API, see the [AWS WAF Developer
    Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/).
