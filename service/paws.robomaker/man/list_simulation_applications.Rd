\title{Returns a list of simulation applications}
\usage{
list_simulation_applications(versionQualifier = NULL, nextToken = NULL,
  maxResults = NULL, filters = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{versionQualifier}{The version qualifier of the simulation application.}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated \code{ListSimulationApplications} request where \code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the \code{nextToken} value.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of deployment job results returned by \code{ListSimulationApplications} in paginated output. When this parameter is used, \code{ListSimulationApplications} only returns \code{maxResults} results in a single page along with a \code{nextToken} response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another \code{ListFleets} request with the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then \code{ListSimulationApplications} returns up to 100 results and a \code{nextToken} value if applicable.}

\item{filters}{Optional list of filters to limit results. The only valid filter name is \code{name}.}

\description{
Returns a list of simulation applications. You can optionally provide filters to retrieve specific simulation applications.
