#' BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers
#'
#' BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers.
#' 
#' For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried with the same records or a subset of the input records.
#' 
#' Every request to BatchMeterUsage is for one product. If you need to meter usage for multiple products, you must make multiple calls to BatchMeterUsage.
#' 
#' BatchMeterUsage can process up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```
#' batch_meter_usage(
#'   UsageRecords = list(
#'     list(
#'       Timestamp = as.POSIXct("2015-01-01"),
#'       CustomerIdentifier = "string",
#'       Dimension = "string",
#'       Quantity = 123
#'     )
#'   ),
#'   ProductCode = "string"
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param UsageRecords &#91;required&#93; The set of UsageRecords to submit. BatchMeterUsage accepts up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.
#' @param ProductCode &#91;required&#93; Product code is used to uniquely identify a product in AWS Marketplace. The product code should be the same as the one used during the publishing of a new product.
#'
#' @export
batch_meter_usage <- function (UsageRecords, ProductCode)

#' API to emit metering records
#'
#' API to emit metering records. For identical requests, the API is idempotent. It simply returns the metering record ID.
#' 
#' MeterUsage is authenticated on the buyer\'s AWS account, generally when running from an EC2 instance on the AWS Marketplace.
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```
#' meter_usage(
#'   ProductCode = "string",
#'   Timestamp = as.POSIXct("2015-01-01"),
#'   UsageDimension = "string",
#'   UsageQuantity = 123,
#'   DryRun = TRUE|FALSE
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param ProductCode &#91;required&#93; Product code is used to uniquely identify a product in AWS Marketplace. The product code should be the same as the one used during the publishing of a new product.
#' @param Timestamp &#91;required&#93; Timestamp of the hour, recorded in UTC. The seconds and milliseconds portions of the timestamp will be ignored.
#' @param UsageDimension &#91;required&#93; It will be one of the fcp dimension name provided during the publishing of the product.
#' @param UsageQuantity &#91;required&#93; Consumption value for the hour.
#' @param DryRun &#91;required&#93; Checks whether you have the permissions required for the action, but does not make the request. If you have the permissions, the request returns DryRunOperation; otherwise, it returns UnauthorizedException.
#'
#' @export

#' Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering
#'
#' Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Calling RegisterUsage from containers running outside of ECS is not currently supported. Free and BYOL products for ECS aren\'t required to call RegisterUsage, but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of RegisterUsage. RegisterUsage performs two primary functions: metering and entitlement.
#' 
#' -   *Entitlement*: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the customer running your paid software is subscribed to your product on AWS Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your container image that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will only be thrown on the initial call to RegisterUsage. Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) will not throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer unsubscribes while the Amazon ECS task is still running.
#' 
#' -   *Metering*: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per hour, with usage prorated to the second. A minimum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a customer has a 10 node ECS cluster and creates an ECS service configured as a Daemon Set, then ECS will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will be charged: (10 \* hourly\_rate). Metering for software use is automatically handled by the AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane \-- your software is not required to perform any metering specific actions, other than call RegisterUsage once for metering of software use to commence. The AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill customers for running ECS tasks, regardless of the customers subscription state, removing the need for your software to perform entitlement checks at runtime.
