#' BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers
#'
#' BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers.
#' 
#' For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried with the same records or a subset of the input records.
#' 
#' Every request to BatchMeterUsage is for one product. If you need to meter usage for multiple products, you must make multiple calls to BatchMeterUsage.
#' 
#' BatchMeterUsage can process up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```
#' batch_meter_usage(
#'   UsageRecords = list(
#'     list(
#'       Timestamp = as.POSIXct("2015-01-01"),
#'       CustomerIdentifier = "string",
#'       Dimension = "string",
#'       Quantity = 123
#'     )
#'   ),
#'   ProductCode = "string"
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param UsageRecords &#91;required&#93; The set of UsageRecords to submit. BatchMeterUsage accepts up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.
#' @param ProductCode &#91;required&#93; Product code is used to uniquely identify a product in AWS Marketplace. The product code should be the same as the one used during the publishing of a new product.
#'
#' @export
batch_meter_usage <- function (UsageRecords, ProductCode) 
{
    op <- new_operation(name = "BatchMeterUsage", http_method = "POST",

#' API to emit metering records
#'
#' API to emit metering records. For identical requests, the API is idempotent. It simply returns the metering record ID.
#' 
#' MeterUsage is authenticated on the buyer\'s AWS account, generally when running from an EC2 instance on the AWS Marketplace.
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```
#' meter_usage(
#'   ProductCode = "string",
#'   Timestamp = as.POSIXct("2015-01-01"),
#'   UsageDimension = "string",
#'   UsageQuantity = 123,
#'   DryRun = TRUE|FALSE
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param ProductCode &#91;required&#93; Product code is used to uniquely identify a product in AWS Marketplace. The product code should be the same as the one used during the publishing of a new product.
#' @param Timestamp &#91;required&#93; Timestamp of the hour, recorded in UTC. The seconds and milliseconds portions of the timestamp will be ignored.
#' @param UsageDimension &#91;required&#93; It will be one of the fcp dimension name provided during the publishing of the product.
#' @param UsageQuantity &#91;required&#93; Consumption value for the hour.
#' @param DryRun &#91;required&#93; Checks whether you have the permissions required for the action, but does not make the request. If you have the permissions, the request returns DryRunOperation; otherwise, it returns UnauthorizedException.
#'
#' @export
