Description: Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a
    managed Docker registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker
    CLI to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure,
    scalable, and reliable registry. Amazon ECR supports private Docker
    repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that
    specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and
    images. Developers can use the Docker CLI to author and manage images.
