Description: Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that
    lets you use standard SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You
    can point Athena at your data in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and
    get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so there is no
    infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only for the queries you
    run. Athena scales automatically---executing queries in parallel---so
    results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For
    more information, see [What is Amazon
    Athena](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html) in
    the *Amazon Athena User Guide*.
