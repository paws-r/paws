\title{Returns information about workflow types in the specified domain}
\usage{
list_workflow_types(domain, name = NULL, registrationStatus,
  nextPageToken = NULL, maximumPageSize = NULL, reverseOrder = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{domain}{[required] The name of the domain in which the workflow types have been registered.}

\item{name}{If specified, lists the workflow type with this name.}

\item{registrationStatus}{[required] Specifies the registration status of the workflow types to list.}

\item{nextPageToken}{If a \code{NextPageToken} was returned by a previous call, there are more results available. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token in \code{nextPageToken}. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

The configured \code{maximumPageSize} determines how many results can be returned in a single call.}

\item{maximumPageSize}{The maximum number of results that are returned per call. \code{nextPageToken} can be used to obtain futher pages of results. The default is 1000, which is the maximum allowed page size. You can, however, specify a page size \emph{smaller} than the maximum.

This is an upper limit only; the actual number of results returned per call may be fewer than the specified maximum.}

\item{reverseOrder}{When set to \code{true}, returns the results in reverse order. By default the results are returned in ascending alphabetical order of the \code{name} of the workflow types.}
}
\description{
Returns information about workflow types in the specified domain. The results may be split into multiple pages that can be retrieved by making the call repeatedly.

\details{
\strong{Access Control}

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
\itemize{
\item Use a \code{Resource} element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
\item Use an \code{Action} element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
\item You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.
}

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's \code{cause} parameter is set to \code{OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED}. For details and example IAM policies, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html}{Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows} in the \emph{Amazon SWF Developer Guide}.
