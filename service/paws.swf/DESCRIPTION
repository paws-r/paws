Description: The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF)
    makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon\'s cloud to
    coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a *task*
    represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of
    your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing
    intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with
    the logical flow of the application.
