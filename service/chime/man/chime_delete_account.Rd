claimed domains for your Amazon Chime account before deletion. As soon
as you release the domain, all users under that account are suspended.

Deleted accounts appear in your \code{Disabled} accounts list for 90 days. To
restore a deleted account from your \code{Disabled} accounts list, you must

After 90 days, deleted accounts are permanently removed from your
\code{Disabled} accounts list.
