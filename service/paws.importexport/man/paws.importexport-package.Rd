\description{
AWS Import/Export Service AWS Import/Export
    accelerates transferring large amounts of data between the AWS cloud
    and portable storage devices that you mail to us. AWS Import/Export
    transfers data directly onto and off of your storage devices using
    Amazon\'s high-speed internal network and bypassing the Internet. For
    large data sets, AWS Import/Export is often faster than Internet
    transfer and more cost effective than upgrading your connectivity.
