Description: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is
    a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a
    relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient,
    resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and
    manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to
    focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.
