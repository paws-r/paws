#'
#' Sends a response to the originator of a handshake agreeing to the action proposed by the handshake request.
#' 
#' This operation can be called only by the following principals when they also have the relevant IAM permissions:
#' 
#' -   **Invitation to join** or **Approve all features request** handshakes: only a principal from the member account.
#' 
#'     The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the `organizations:AcceptHandshake` permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, then the user must also have the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permission so that Organizations can create the required service-linked role named *AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations*. For more information, see [AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integration_services.html#orgs_integration_service-linked-roles) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
#' 
#' -   **Enable all features final confirmation** handshake: only a principal from the master account.

#' Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual account
#'
#' Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual account. How the policy affects accounts depends on the type of policy:
#' 
#' -   **Service control policy (SCP)** - An SCP specifies what permissions can be delegated to users in affected member accounts. The scope of influence for a policy depends on what you attach the policy to:
#' 
#'     -   If you attach an SCP to a root, it affects all accounts in the organization.
#' 
#'     -   If you attach an SCP to an OU, it affects all accounts in that OU and in any child OUs.
#' 
#'     -   If you attach the policy directly to an account, then it affects only that account.
#' 
#'     SCPs essentially are permission \"filters\". When you attach one SCP to a higher level root or OU, and you also attach a different SCP to a child OU or to an account, the child policy can further restrict only the permissions that pass through the parent filter and are available to the child. An SCP that is attached to a child cannot grant a permission that is not already granted by the parent. For example, imagine that the parent SCP allows permissions A, B, C, D, and E. The child SCP allows C, D, E, F, and G. The result is that the accounts affected by the child SCP are allowed to use only C, D, and E. They cannot use A or B because they were filtered out by the child OU. They also cannot use F and G because they were filtered out by the parent OU. They cannot be granted back by the child SCP; child SCPs can only filter the permissions they receive from the parent SCP.
#' 
#'     AWS Organizations attaches a default SCP named `\"FullAWSAccess` to every root, OU, and account. This default SCP allows all services and actions, enabling any new child OU or account to inherit the permissions of the parent root or OU. If you detach the default policy, you must replace it with a policy that specifies the permissions that you want to allow in that OU or account.
#' 
#'     For more information about how Organizations policies permissions work, see [Using Service Control Policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
#'

#' Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request
#'
#' Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because `CreateAccount` operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:
#' 
#' -   Use the `OperationId` response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.
#' 
#' -   Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the `CreateAccountResult` event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see [Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
#' 
#' The user who calls the API to create an account must have the `organizations:CreateAccount` permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, AWS Organizations will create the required service-linked role named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`. For more information, see [AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
#' 
#' AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` by default) that grants users in the master account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the master account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization\'s master account.
#' 
#' This operation can be called only from the organization\'s master account.
#' 
#' For more information about creating accounts, see [Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
#' 
#' -   When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is *not* automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at [To leave an organization as a member account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
#' 
#' -   If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact [AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).
#' 
#' -   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact [AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).
#' 
#' When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the **IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information** switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see [Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html).

#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param Email &#91;required&#93; The email address of the owner to assign to the new member account. This email address must not already be associated with another AWS account. You must use a valid email address to complete account creation. You can\'t access the root user of the account or remove an account that was created with an invalid email address.
#' @param AccountName &#91;required&#93; The friendly name of the member account.
#' @param RoleName (Optional)
#' 
#' The name of an IAM role that AWS Organizations automatically preconfigures in the new member account. This role trusts the master account, allowing users in the master account to assume the role, as permitted by the master account administrator. The role has administrator permissions in the new member account.
#' 
#' If you don\'t specify this parameter, the role name defaults to `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`.
#' 
#' For more information about how to use this role to access the member account, see [Accessing and Administering the Member Accounts in Your Organization](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*, and steps 2 and 3 in [Tutorial: Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using IAM Roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters that can consist of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits with no spaces, and any of the following characters: =,.@-
#' @param IamUserAccessToBilling If set to `ALLOW`, the new account enables IAM users to access account billing information *if* they have the required permissions.

#' 
#' This operation must be called using credentials from the account that is to become the new organization\'s master account. The principal must also have the relevant IAM permissions.
#' 
#' By default (or if you set the `FeatureSet` parameter to `ALL`), the new organization is created with all features enabled and service control policies automatically enabled in the root.

#' Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or account
#'
#' Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or account. If the policy being detached is a service control policy (SCP), the changes to permissions for IAM users and roles in affected accounts are immediate.
#' 
#' **Note:** Every root, OU, and account must have at least one SCP attached. If you want to replace the default `FullAWSAccess` policy with one that limits the permissions that can be delegated, then you must attach the replacement policy before you can remove the default one.

If you instead attach a second SCP and leave the `FullAWSAccess` SCP still attached, and specify `"Effect": "Deny"` in the second SCP to override the `"Effect": "Allow"` in the `FullAWSAccess` policy (or any other attached SCP), then you are using the authorization strategy of [blacklisting](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html#orgs_policies_blacklist).

#' Disables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified by ServicePrincipal) with AWS Organizations
#'
#' Disables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified by `ServicePrincipal`) with AWS Organizations. When you disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a [service-linked role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in *new* accounts in your organization. This means the service can\'t perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from AWS Organizations.
#' 
#' We recommend that you disable integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS service by using the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. Doing so ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its resources in the organization\'s accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other AWS service.
#' 
#' After you perform the `DisableAWSServiceAccess` operation, the specified service can no longer perform operations in your organization\'s accounts unless the operations are explicitly permitted by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles.

#' 
#' This operation is required only for organizations that were created explicitly with only the consolidated billing features enabled. Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in the organization. The feature set change can be finalized and the additional features enabled only after all administrators in the invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake.
#' 
#' After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable individual policy types in a root using EnablePolicyType and DisablePolicyType. To see the status of policy types in a root, use ListRoots.

#' Sends an invitation to another account to join your organization as a member account. Organizations sends email on your behalf to the email address that is associated with the other account\'s owner. The invitation is implemented as a Handshake whose details are in the response.
#' 
#' -   You can invite AWS accounts only from the same seller as the master account. For example, if your organization\'s master account was created by Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd (AISPL), an AWS seller in India, then you can only invite other AISPL accounts to your organization. You can\'t combine accounts from AISPL and AWS, or any other AWS seller. For more information, see [Consolidated Billing in India](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilliing-India.html).
#' 
#' -   If you receive an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization or that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists after an hour, then contact [AWS Customer Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).
#' 
#' This operation can be called only from the organization\'s master account.

#'   ),
#'   Notes = "string"
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param Target &#91;required&#93; The identifier (ID) of the AWS account that you want to invite to join your organization. This is a JSON object that contains the following elements:
#' 
#' `{ "Type": "ACCOUNT", "Id": "< account id number >" } account id number >" }`
#' 
#' If you use the AWS CLI, you can submit this as a single string, similar to the following example:
#' 
#' `--target Id=123456789012,Type=ACCOUNT`
#' 
#' If you specify `"Type": "ACCOUNT"`, then you must provide the AWS account ID number as the `Id`. If you specify `"Type": "EMAIL"`, then you must specify the email address that is associated with the account.
#' 
#' `--target Id=diego@example.com,Type=EMAIL`
#' @param Notes Additional information that you want to include in the generated email to the recipient account owner.

#' Removes a member account from its parent organization
#'
#' Removes a member account from its parent organization. This version of the operation is performed by the account that wants to leave. To remove a member account as a user in the master account, use RemoveAccountFromOrganization instead.
#' 
#' This operation can be called only from a member account in the organization.
#' 
#' -   The master account in an organization with all features enabled can set service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what administrators of member accounts can do, including preventing them from successfully calling `LeaveOrganization` and leaving the organization.
#' 
#' -   You can leave an organization as a member account only if the account is configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is *not* automatically collected. For each account that you want to make standalone, you must accept the End User License Agreement (EULA), choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment method. AWS uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS activity that occurs while the account is not attached to an organization. Follow the steps at [To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
#' 
#' -   You can leave an organization only after you enable IAM user access to billing in your account. For more information, see [Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.

#' Lists the root or organizational units (OUs) that serve as the immediate parent of the specified child OU or account
#'
#' Lists the root or organizational units (OUs) that serve as the immediate parent of the specified child OU or account. This operation, along with ListChildren enables you to traverse the tree structure that makes up this root.
#' 
#' Always check the `NextToken` response parameter for a `null` value when calling a `List*` operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The `NextToken` response parameter value is `null` *only* when there are no more results to display.
#' 
#' This operation can be called only from the organization\'s master account.
#' 
#' In the current release, a child can have only a single parent.

#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param ChildId &#91;required&#93; The unique identifier (ID) of the OU or account whose parent containers you want to list. Do not specify a root.
#' 
#' The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) for a child ID string requires one of the following:
#' 
#' -   Account: a string that consists of exactly 12 digits.
#' 
#' -   Organizational unit (OU): a string that begins with \"ou-\" followed by from 4 to 32 lower-case letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU) followed by a second \"-\" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lower-case letters or digits.
#' @param NextToken Use this parameter if you receive a `NextToken` response in a previous request that indicates that there is more output available. Set it to the value of the previous call\'s `NextToken` response to indicate where the output should continue from.
#' @param MaxResults (Optional) Use this to limit the number of results you want included per page in the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `NextToken` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the `NextToken` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

#' Removes the specified account from the organization
#'
#' Removes the specified account from the organization.
#' 
#' The removed account becomes a stand-alone account that is not a member of any organization. It is no longer subject to any policies and is responsible for its own bill payments. The organization\'s master account is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member account after it is removed from the organization.
#' 
#' This operation can be called only from the organization\'s master account. Member accounts can remove themselves with LeaveOrganization instead.
#' 
#' You can remove an account from your organization only if the account is configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is *not* automatically collected. For an account that you want to make standalone, you must accept the End User License Agreement (EULA), choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment method. AWS uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS activity that occurs while the account is not attached to an organization. To remove an account that does not yet have this information, you must sign in as the member account and follow the steps at [To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
