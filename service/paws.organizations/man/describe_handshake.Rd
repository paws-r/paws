\usage{
describe_handshake(HandshakeId)
}
\arguments{
\item{HandshakeId}{[required] The unique identifier (ID) of the handshake that you want information about. You can get the ID from the original call to InviteAccountToOrganization, or from a call to ListHandshakesForAccount or ListHandshakesForOrganization.

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed by from 8 to 32 lower-case letters or digits.}
}
\description{
Retrieves information about a previously requested handshake. The handshake ID comes from the response to the original InviteAccountToOrganization operation that generated the handshake.
}
\details{
You can access handshakes that are ACCEPTED, DECLINED, or CANCELED for only 30 days after they change to that state. They are then deleted and no longer accessible.

This operation can be called from any account in the organization.
