\title{Revokes a certificate that you issued by calling the IssueCertificate operation}
\usage{
revoke_certificate(CertificateAuthorityArn, CertificateSerial,
  RevocationReason)
}
\arguments{
\item{CertificateAuthorityArn}{[required] Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that issued the certificate to be revoked. This must be of the form:

\code{arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 }}

\item{CertificateSerial}{[required] Serial number of the certificate to be revoked. This must be in hexadecimal format. You can retrieve the serial number by calling GetCertificate with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate you want and the ARN of your private CA. The \strong{GetCertificate} operation retrieves the certificate in the PEM format. You can use the following OpenSSL command to list the certificate in text format and copy the hexadecimal serial number.

\code{openssl x509 -in file_path -text -nooutfile_path -text -noout}

You can also copy the serial number from the console or use the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCertificate.html}{DescribeCertificate} operation in the \emph{AWS Certificate Manager API Reference}.}

\item{RevocationReason}{[required] Specifies why you revoked the certificate.}
}
\description{
Revokes a certificate that you issued by calling the IssueCertificate operation. If you enable a certificate revocation list (CRL) when you create or update your private CA, information about the revoked certificates will be included in the CRL. ACM PCA writes the CRL to an S3 bucket that you specify. For more information about revocation, see the CrlConfiguration structure. ACM PCA also writes revocation information to the audit report. For more information, see CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport.
