\title{Uses your private certificate authority (CA) to issue a client certificate}
\usage{
issue_certificate(CertificateAuthorityArn, Csr, SigningAlgorithm, Validity,
  IdempotencyToken = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{CertificateAuthorityArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called CreateCertificateAuthority. This must be of the form:

\code{arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 }}

\item{Csr}{[required] The certificate signing request (CSR) for the certificate you want to issue. You can use the following OpenSSL command to create the CSR and a 2048 bit RSA private key.

\code{openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout private/test_cert_priv_key.pem -out csr/test_cert_.csr}

If you have a configuration file, you can use the following OpenSSL command. The \code{usr_cert} block in the configuration file contains your X509 version 3 extensions.

\code{openssl req -new -config openssl_rsa.cnf -extensions usr_cert -newkey rsa:2048 -days -365 -keyout private/test_cert_priv_key.pem -out csr/test_cert_.csr}}

\item{SigningAlgorithm}{[required] The name of the algorithm that will be used to sign the certificate to be issued.}

\item{Validity}{[required] The type of the validity period.}

\item{IdempotencyToken}{Custom string that can be used to distinguish between calls to the \strong{IssueCertificate} operation. Idempotency tokens time out after one hour. Therefore, if you call \strong{IssueCertificate} multiple times with the same idempotency token within 5 minutes, ACM PCA recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, PCA recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates.}

\description{
Uses your private certificate authority (CA) to issue a client certificate. This operation returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate. You can retrieve the certificate by calling the GetCertificate operation and specifying the ARN.
}
\details{
You cannot use the ACM \strong{ListCertificateAuthorities} operation to retrieve the ARNs of the certificates that you issue by using ACM PCA.
