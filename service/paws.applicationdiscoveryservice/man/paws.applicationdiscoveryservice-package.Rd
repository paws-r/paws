\description{
AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan
    application migration projects by automatically identifying servers,
    virtual machines (VMs), software, and software dependencies running in
    your on-premises data centers. Application Discovery Service also
    collects application performance data, which can help you assess the
    outcome of your migration. The data collected by Application Discovery
    Service is securely retained in an AWS-hosted and managed database in
    the cloud. You can export the data as a CSV or XML file into your
    preferred visualization tool or cloud-migration solution to plan your
    migration. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery
    Service FAQ](http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/).
