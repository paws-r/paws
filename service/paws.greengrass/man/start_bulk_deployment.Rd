\title{Deploys multiple groups in one operation}
\usage{
start_bulk_deployment(AmznClientToken = NULL, ExecutionRoleArn = NULL,
  InputFileUri = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{AmznClientToken}{A client token used to correlate requests and responses.}

\item{ExecutionRoleArn}{The ARN of the execution role to associate with the bulk deployment operation. This IAM role must allow the ''greengrass:CreateDeployment'' action for all group versions that are listed in the input file. This IAM role must have access to the S3 bucket containing the input file.}

\item{InputFileUri}{The URI of the input file contained in the S3 bucket. The execution role must have ''getObject'' permissions on this bucket to access the input file. The input file is a JSON-serialized, line delimited file with UTF-8 encoding that provides a list of group and version IDs and the deployment type. This file must be less than 100 MB. Currently, AWS IoT Greengrass supports only ''NewDeployment'' deployment types.}

\description{
Deploys multiple groups in one operation. This action starts the bulk deployment of a specified set of group versions. Each group version deployment will be triggered with an adaptive rate that has a fixed upper limit. We recommend that you include an ''X-Amzn-Client-Token'' token in every ''StartBulkDeployment'' request. These requests are idempotent with respect to the token and the request parameters.
