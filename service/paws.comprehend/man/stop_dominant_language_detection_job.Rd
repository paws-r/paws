If the job state is \code{IN_PROGRESS} the job is marked for termination and put into the \code{STOP_REQUESTED} state. If the job completes before it can be stopped, it is put into the \code{COMPLETED} state; otherwise the job is stopped and put into the \code{STOPPED} state.

If the job is in the \code{COMPLETED} or \code{FAILED} state when you call the \code{StopDominantLanguageDetectionJob} operation, the operation returns a 400 Internal Request Exception.

When a job is stopped, any documents already processed are written to the output location.
