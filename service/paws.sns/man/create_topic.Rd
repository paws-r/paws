\description{
Creates a topic to which notifications can be published. Users can create at most 100,000 topics. For more information, see \href{http://aws.amazon.com/sns/}{http://aws.amazon.com/sns}. This action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns a topic with the specified name, that topic's ARN is returned without creating a new topic.
