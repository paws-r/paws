AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes
    it easy for you to setup and run directories in the AWS cloud, or
    connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft
    Active Directory. This guide provides detailed information about AWS
    Directory Service operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For
    information about AWS Directory Services features, see [AWS Directory
    Service](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) and the [AWS
