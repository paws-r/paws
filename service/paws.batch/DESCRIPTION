Description: AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing
    workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for
    developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of
    compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy
    lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS
    Batch will be familiar to users of traditional batch computing
    software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response
    to jobs submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce
    compute costs, and deliver results quickly.
