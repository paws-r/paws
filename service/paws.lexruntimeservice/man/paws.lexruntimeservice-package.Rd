\title{paws.lexruntimeservice: Amazon Lex Runtime Service}
\description{
Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime
    endpoints. Each endpoint provides a set of operations (API). Your
    conversational bot uses the runtime API to understand user utterances
    (user input text or voice). For example, suppose a user says \"I want
    pizza\", your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime
    API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user request is for the OrderPizza
    intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon Lex
    engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required
    information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust type), and then
    performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when you created
    the bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your Amazon
    Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time API,.
