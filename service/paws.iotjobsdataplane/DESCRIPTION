Description: AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define
    a set of jobs --- remote operations that are sent to and executed on
    one or more devices connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define
    a job that instructs a set of devices to download and install
    application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or
    perform remote troubleshooting operations.
