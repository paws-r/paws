\title{Describes the specified WorkSpaces}
\usage{
workspaces_describe_workspaces(WorkspaceIds, DirectoryId, UserName,
  BundleId, Limit, NextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{WorkspaceIds}{The identifiers of the WorkSpaces. You cannot combine this parameter
with any other filter.

Because the CreateWorkspaces operation is asynchronous, the identifier
it returns is not immediately available. If you immediately call
DescribeWorkspaces with this identifier, no information is returned.}

\item{DirectoryId}{The identifier of the directory. In addition, you can optionally specify
a specific directory user (see \code{UserName}). You cannot combine this
parameter with any other filter.}

\item{UserName}{The name of the directory user. You must specify this parameter with
\code{DirectoryId}.}

\item{BundleId}{The identifier of the bundle. All WorkSpaces that are created from this
bundle are retrieved. You cannot combine this parameter with any other
filter.}

\item{Limit}{The maximum number of items to return.}

\item{NextToken}{If you received a \code{NextToken} from a previous call that was paginated,
provide this token to receive the next set of results.}
}
\description{
Describes the specified WorkSpaces.
}
\details{
You can filter the results by using the bundle identifier, directory
identifier, or owner, but you can specify only one filter at a time.
