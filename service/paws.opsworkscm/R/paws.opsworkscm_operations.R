#' Associates a new node with the server
#'
#' Associates a new node with the server. For more information about how to disassociate a node, see DisassociateNode.
#' 
#' On a Chef server: This command is an alternative to `knife bootstrap`.
#' 
#' Example (Chef): `aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes "Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value=default" "Name=CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY,Value=public-key-pem"MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes "Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value=default" "Name=CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY,Value=public-key-pem"`
#' 
#' On a Puppet server, this command is an alternative to the `puppet cert sign` command that signs a Puppet node CSR.
#' 
#' Example (Chef): `aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes "Name=PUPPET_NODE_CSR,Value=csr-pem"MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes "Name=PUPPET_NODE_CSR,Value=csr-pem"`
#' 
#' A node can can only be associated with servers that are in a `HEALTHY` state. Otherwise, an `InvalidStateException` is thrown. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server does not exist. A `ValidationException` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid. The AssociateNode API call can be integrated into Auto Scaling configurations, AWS Cloudformation templates, or the user data of a server\'s instance.

#' Creates an application-level backup of a server
#'
#' Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is in the `BACKING_UP` state, the server cannot be changed, and no additional backup can be created.
#' 
#' Backups can be created for servers in `RUNNING`, `HEALTHY`, and `UNHEALTHY` states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups.
#' 
#' This operation is asynchronous.
#' 
#' A `LimitExceededException` is thrown when the maximum number of manual backups is reached. An `InvalidStateException` is thrown when the server is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server is not found. A `ValidationException` is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```

#' Creates and immedately starts a new server
#'
#' Creates and immedately starts a new server. The server is ready to use when it is in the `HEALTHY` state. By default, you can create a maximum of 10 servers.
#' 
#' This operation is asynchronous.
#' 
#' A `LimitExceededException` is thrown when you have created the maximum number of servers (10). A `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` is thrown when a server with the same name already exists in the account. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when you specify a backup ID that is not valid or is for a backup that does not exist. A `ValidationException` is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.
#' 
#' If you do not specify a security group by adding the `SecurityGroupIds` parameter, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group.
#' 
#' *Chef Automate:* The default security group opens the Chef server to the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.
#' 
#' *Puppet Enterprise:* The default security group opens TCP ports 22, 443, 4433, 8140, 8142, 8143, and 8170. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.
#' 
#' By default, your server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console.

#' 
#' **Attributes accepted in a Chef createServer request:**
#' 
#' -   `CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY`: A base64-encoded RSA private key that is not stored by AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate. This private key is required to access the Chef API. When no CHEF\_PIVOTAL\_KEY is set, one is generated and returned in the response.
#' 
#' -   `CHEF_DELIVERY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The password for the administrative user in the Chef Automate GUI. The password length is a minimum of eight characters, and a maximum of 32. The password can contain letters, numbers, and special characters (!/@\#\$%\^&+=\_). The password must contain at least one lower case letter, one upper case letter, one number, and one special character. When no CHEF\_DELIVERY\_ADMIN\_PASSWORD is set, one is generated and returned in the response.
#' 
#' **Attributes accepted in a Puppet createServer request:**
#' 
#' -   `PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: To work with the Puppet Enterprise console, a password must use ASCII characters.
#' @param BackupRetentionCount The number of automated backups that you want to keep. Whenever a new backup is created, AWS OpsWorks CM deletes the oldest backups if this number is exceeded. The default value is `1`.
#' @param ServerName &#91;required&#93; The name of the server. The server name must be unique within your AWS account, within each region. Server names must start with a letter; then letters, numbers, or hyphens (-) are allowed, up to a maximum of 40 characters.
#' @param InstanceProfileArn &#91;required&#93; The ARN of the instance profile that your Amazon EC2 instances use. Although the AWS OpsWorks console typically creates the instance profile for you, if you are using API commands instead, run the service-role-creation.yaml AWS CloudFormation template, located at https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-cm-us-east-1-prod-default-assets/misc/opsworks-cm-roles.yaml. This template creates a CloudFormation stack that includes the instance profile you need.
#' @param InstanceType &#91;required&#93; The Amazon EC2 instance type to use. For example, `m4.large`. Recommended instance types include `t2.medium` and greater, `m4.*`, or `c4.xlarge` and greater.
#' @param KeyPair The Amazon EC2 key pair to set for the instance. This parameter is optional; if desired, you may specify this parameter to connect to your instances by using SSH.
#' @param PreferredMaintenanceWindow The start time for a one-hour period each week during which AWS OpsWorks CM performs maintenance on the instance. Valid values must be specified in the following format: `DDD:HH:MM`. The specified time is in coordinated universal time (UTC). The default value is a random one-hour period on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday. See `TimeWindowDefinition` for more information.
#' 
#' **Example:** `Mon:08:00`, which represents a start time of every Monday at 08:00 UTC. (8:00 a.m.)
#' @param PreferredBackupWindow The start time for a one-hour period during which AWS OpsWorks CM backs up application-level data on your server if automated backups are enabled. Valid values must be specified in one of the following formats:
#' 
#' -   `HH:MM` for daily backups
#' 
#' -   `DDD:HH:MM` for weekly backups
#' 
#' The specified time is in coordinated universal time (UTC). The default value is a random, daily start time.
#' 
#' **Example:** `08:00`, which represents a daily start time of 08:00 UTC.
#' 
#' **Example:** `Mon:08:00`, which represents a start time of every Monday at 08:00 UTC. (8:00 a.m.)
#' @param SecurityGroupIds A list of security group IDs to attach to the Amazon EC2 instance. If you add this parameter, the specified security groups must be within the VPC that is specified by `SubnetIds`.
#' 
#' If you do not specify this parameter, AWS OpsWorks CM creates one new security group that uses TCP ports 22 and 443, open to 0.0.0.0/0 (everyone).
#' @param ServiceRoleArn &#91;required&#93; The service role that the AWS OpsWorks CM service backend uses to work with your account. Although the AWS OpsWorks management console typically creates the service role for you, if you are using the AWS CLI or API commands, run the service-role-creation.yaml AWS CloudFormation template, located at https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-cm-us-east-1-prod-default-assets/misc/opsworks-cm-roles.yaml. This template creates a CloudFormation stack that includes the service role and instance profile that you need.
#' @param SubnetIds The IDs of subnets in which to launch the server EC2 instance.
#' 
#' Amazon EC2-Classic customers: This field is required. All servers must run within a VPC. The VPC must have \"Auto Assign Public IP\" enabled.
#' 
#' EC2-VPC customers: This field is optional. If you do not specify subnet IDs, your EC2 instances are created in a default subnet that is selected by Amazon EC2. If you specify subnet IDs, the VPC must have \"Auto Assign Public IP\" enabled.
#' 
#' For more information about supported Amazon EC2 platforms, see [Supported Platforms](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html).

#' @param ExportAttributeName &#91;required&#93; The name of the export attribute. Currently supported export attribute is \"Userdata\" which exports a userdata script filled out with parameters provided in the `InputAttributes` list.
#' @param ServerName &#91;required&#93; The name of the Server to which the attribute is being exported from
#' @param InputAttributes The list of engine attributes. The list type is `EngineAttribute`. `EngineAttribute` is a pair of attribute name and value. For `ExportAttributeName` \"Userdata\", currently supported input attribute names are: - \"RunList\": For Chef, an ordered list of roles and/or recipes that are run in the exact order. For Puppet, this parameter is ignored. - \"OrganizationName\": For Chef, an organization name. AWS OpsWorks for Chef Server always creates the organization \"default\". For Puppet, this parameter is ignored. - \"NodeEnvironment\": For Chef, a node environment (eg. development, staging, onebox). For Puppet, this parameter is ignored. - \"NodeClientVersion\": For Chef, version of Chef Engine (3 numbers separated by dots, eg. \"13.8.5\"). If empty, it uses the latest one. For Puppet, this parameter is ignored.

#' Restores a backup to a server that is in a CONNECTION_LOST, HEALTHY, RUNNING, UNHEALTHY, or TERMINATED state
#'
#' Restores a backup to a server that is in a `CONNECTION_LOST`, `HEALTHY`, `RUNNING`, `UNHEALTHY`, or `TERMINATED` state. When you run RestoreServer, the server\'s EC2 instance is deleted, and a new EC2 instance is configured. RestoreServer maintains the existing server endpoint, so configuration management of the server\'s client devices (nodes) should continue to work.
#' 
#' This operation is asynchronous.
#' 
#' An `InvalidStateException` is thrown when the server is not in a valid state. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server does not exist. A `ValidationException` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.
#'
#' @section Accepted Parameters:
#' ```
#' restore_server(
#'   BackupId = "string",
#'   ServerName = "string",
#'   InstanceType = "string",
#'   KeyPair = "string"
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param BackupId &#91;required&#93; The ID of the backup that you want to use to restore a server.
#' @param ServerName &#91;required&#93; The name of the server that you want to restore.
#' @param InstanceType The type of the instance to create. Valid values must be specified in the following format: `^([cm][34]|t2).*` For example, `m4.large`. Valid values are `t2.medium`, `m4.large`, and `m4.2xlarge`. If you do not specify this parameter, RestoreServer uses the instance type from the specified backup.
#' @param KeyPair The name of the key pair to set on the new EC2 instance. This can be helpful if the administrator no longer has the SSH key.

#' Manually starts server maintenance
#'
#' Manually starts server maintenance. This command can be useful if an earlier maintenance attempt failed, and the underlying cause of maintenance failure has been resolved. The server is in an `UNDER_MAINTENANCE` state while maintenance is in progress.
#' 
#' Maintenance can only be started on servers in `HEALTHY` and `UNHEALTHY` states. Otherwise, an `InvalidStateException` is thrown. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server does not exist. A `ValidationException` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.
