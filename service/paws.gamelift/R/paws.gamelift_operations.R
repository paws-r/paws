#' Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match
#'
#' Registers a player\'s acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.
#' 
#' When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status `REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.
#' 
#' To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status `PLACING`, where a new game session is created for the match.
#' 
#' If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where all players accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to `SEARCHING` to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to accept the match, the ticket status is set to `FAILED`, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.

#' Creates an alias for a fleet
#'
#' Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. By using a fleet alias instead of a specific fleet ID, you can switch gameplay and players to a new fleet without changing your game client or other game components. For example, for games in production, using an alias allows you to seamlessly redirect your player base to a new game server update.
#' 
#' Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.
#' 
#' To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling `UpdateAlias`.

#' Creates a new Amazon GameLift build record for your game server binary files and points to the location of your game server build files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location
#'
#' Creates a new Amazon GameLift build record for your game server binary files and points to the location of your game server build files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location.
#' 
#' Game server binaries must be combined into a `.zip` file for use with Amazon GameLift. See [Uploading Your Game](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-intro.html) for more information.
#' 
#' To create new builds quickly and easily, use the AWS CLI command **[upload-build](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html)** . This helper command uploads your build and creates a new build record in one step, and automatically handles the necessary permissions. See [Upload Build Files to Amazon GameLift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-cli-uploading.html) for more help.
#' 
#' The `CreateBuild` operation should be used only when you need to manually upload your build files, as in the following scenarios:
#' 
#' -   Store a build file in an Amazon S3 bucket under your own AWS account. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to that Amazon S3 bucket. See [Create a Build with Files in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-cli-uploading.html#gamelift-build-cli-uploading-create-build) for detailed help. To create a new build record using files in your Amazon S3 bucket, call `CreateBuild` and specify a build name, operating system, and the storage location of your game build.
#' 
#' -   Upload a build file directly to Amazon GameLift\'s Amazon S3 account. To use this option, you first call `CreateBuild` with a build name and operating system. This action creates a new build record and returns an Amazon S3 storage location (bucket and key only) and temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build file to the storage location (see the Amazon S3 topic [Uploading Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html)). You can upload files to a location only once.
#' 
#' If successful, this operation creates a new build record with a unique build ID and places it in `INITIALIZED` status. You can use DescribeBuild to check the status of your build. A build must be in `READY` status before it can be used to create fleets.

#'
#' @param Name Descriptive label that is associated with a build. Build names do not need to be unique. You can use UpdateBuild to change this value later.
#' @param Version Version that is associated with this build. Version strings do not need to be unique. You can use UpdateBuild to change this value later.
#' @param StorageLocation Information indicating where your game build files are stored. Use this parameter only when creating a build with files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that you own. The storage location must specify an Amazon S3 bucket name and key, as well as a role ARN that you set up to allow Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon S3 bucket. The S3 bucket must be in the same region that you want to create a new build in.
#' @param OperatingSystem Operating system that the game server binaries are built to run on. This value determines the type of fleet resources that you can use for this build. If your game build contains multiple executables, they all must run on the same operating system. If an operating system is not specified when creating a build, Amazon GameLift uses the default value (WINDOWS\_2012). This value cannot be changed later.

#' Creates a new fleet to run your game servers
#'
#' Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can run multiple server processes to host game sessions. You set up a fleet to use instances with certain hardware specifications (see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)), and deploy your game build to the fleet.
#' 
#' To create a new fleet, you must provide the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) an EC2 instance type, (3) the build ID for your game build, and (4) a run-time configuration, which specifies the server processes to run on each instance in the fleet. If fleet type is not set, the new fleet will use on-demand instances by default.
#' 
#' If the `CreateFleet` call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks. You can track the process of a fleet by checking the fleet status or by monitoring fleet creation events:
#' 
#' -   Creates a fleet record. Status: `NEW`.
#' 
#' -   Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the Amazon GameLift console.
#' 
#'     Sets the fleet\'s target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which triggers Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.
#' 
#' -   Downloads the game build to the new instance and installs it. Statuses: `DOWNLOADING`, `VALIDATING`, `BUILDING`.
#' 
#' -   Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon GameLift staggers each launch by a few seconds. Status: `ACTIVATING`.
#' 
#' -   Sets the fleet\'s status to `ACTIVE` as soon as one server process is ready to host a game session.

#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; Descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names do not need to be unique.
#' @param Description Human-readable description of a fleet.
#' @param BuildId &#91;required&#93; Unique identifier for a build to be deployed on the new fleet. The build must have been successfully uploaded to Amazon GameLift and be in a `READY` status. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the fleet is created.
#' @param ServerLaunchPath This parameter is no longer used. Instead, specify a server launch path using the `RuntimeConfiguration` parameter. (Requests that specify a server launch path and launch parameters instead of a run-time configuration will continue to work.)
#' @param ServerLaunchParameters This parameter is no longer used. Instead, specify server launch parameters in the `RuntimeConfiguration` parameter. (Requests that specify a server launch path and launch parameters instead of a run-time configuration will continue to work.)
#' @param LogPaths This parameter is no longer used. Instead, to specify where Amazon GameLift should store log files once a server process shuts down, use the Amazon GameLift server API `ProcessReady()` and specify one or more directory paths in `logParameters`. See more information in the [Server API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api-ref.html#gamelift-sdk-server-api-ref-dataypes-process).
#' @param EC2InstanceType &#91;required&#93; Name of an EC2 instance type that is supported in Amazon GameLift. A fleet instance type determines the computing resources of each instance in the fleet, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. Amazon GameLift supports the following EC2 instance types. See [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for detailed descriptions.
#' @param EC2InboundPermissions Range of IP addresses and port settings that permit inbound traffic to access server processes running on the fleet. If no inbound permissions are set, including both IP address range and port range, the server processes in the fleet cannot accept connections. You can specify one or more sets of permissions for a fleet.
#' @param NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy Game session protection policy to apply to all instances in this fleet. If this parameter is not set, instances in this fleet default to no protection. You can change a fleet\'s protection policy using UpdateFleetAttributes, but this change will only affect sessions created after the policy change. You can also set protection for individual instances using UpdateGameSession.
#' 
#' -   **NoProtection** \-- The game session can be terminated during a scale-down event.
#' 
#' -   **FullProtection** \-- If the game session is in an `ACTIVE` status, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
#' @param RuntimeConfiguration Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the fleet. The run-time configuration for a fleet has a collection of server process configurations, one for each type of server process to run on an instance. A server process configuration specifies the location of the server executable, launch parameters, and the number of concurrent processes with that configuration to maintain on each instance. A CreateFleet request must include a run-time configuration with at least one server process configuration; otherwise the request fails with an invalid request exception. (This parameter replaces the parameters `ServerLaunchPath` and `ServerLaunchParameters`; requests that contain values for these parameters instead of a run-time configuration will continue to work.)
#' @param ResourceCreationLimitPolicy Policy that limits the number of game sessions an individual player can create over a span of time for this fleet.
#' @param MetricGroups Name of an Amazon CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A metric group aggregates the metrics for all fleets in the group. Specify an existing metric group name, or provide a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can only be included in one metric group at a time.
#' @param PeerVpcAwsAccountId Unique identifier for the AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer your Amazon GameLift fleet with. You can find your Account ID in the AWS Management Console under account settings.
#' @param PeerVpcId Unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same region where your fleet is deployed. Look up a VPC ID using the [VPC Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/) in the AWS Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in [VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html).
#' @param FleetType Indicates whether to use on-demand instances or spot instances for this fleet. If empty, the default is ON\_DEMAND. Both categories of instances use identical hardware and configurations, based on the instance type selected for this fleet. You can acquire on-demand instances at any time for a fixed price and keep them as long as you need them. Spot instances have lower prices, but spot pricing is variable, and while in use they can be interrupted (with a two-minute notification). Learn more about Amazon GameLift spot instances with at [Set up Access to External Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-credentials.html).

#' Creates a multiplayer game session for players
#'
#' Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an `ACTIVE` status before a game session can be created in it.
#' 
#' To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game session. If successful, a GameSession object is returned containing the game session properties and other settings you specified.
#' 
#' **Idempotency tokens.** You can add a token that uniquely identifies game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result. All response values are the same with the exception of game session status, which may change.
#' 
#' **Resource creation limits.** If you are creating a game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the policy for this new game session request.
#' 
#' **Player acceptance policy.** By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using UpdateGameSession to change the game session\'s player session creation policy.
#' 
#' **Game session logs.** Logs are retained for all active game sessions for 14 days. To access the logs, call GetGameSessionLogUrl to download the log files.

#' Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions
#'
#' Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted \-- by specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) \-- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple regions. To add placement requests to a queue, call StartGameSessionPlacement and reference the queue name.
#' 
#' **Destination order.** When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue\'s default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.
#' 
#' **Player latency policies.** For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy\'s maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc.
#' 
#' To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies. If successful, a new queue object is returned.

#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; Descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue names must be unique within each region.
#' @param TimeoutInSeconds Maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement changes to a `TIMED_OUT` status.
#' @param PlayerLatencyPolicies Collection of latency policies to apply when processing game sessions placement requests with player latency information. Multiple policies are evaluated in order of the maximum latency value, starting with the lowest latency values. With just one policy, it is enforced at the start of the game session placement for the duration period. With multiple policies, each policy is enforced consecutively for its duration period. For example, a queue might enforce a 60-second policy followed by a 120-second policy, and then no policy for the remainder of the placement. A player latency policy must set a value for MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds; if none is set, this API requests will fail.
#' @param Destinations List of fleets that can be used to fulfill game session placement requests in the queue. Fleets are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN. Destinations are listed in default preference order.

#' Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch
#'
#' Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. A matchmaking configuration sets out guidelines for matching players and getting the matches into games. You can set up multiple matchmaking configurations to handle the scenarios needed for your game. Each matchmaking ticket (StartMatchmaking or StartMatchBackfill) specifies a configuration for the match and provides player attributes to support the configuration being used.
#' 
#' To create a matchmaking configuration, at a minimum you must specify the following: configuration name; a rule set that governs how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; a game session queue to use when placing a new game session for the match; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt.
#' 
#' **Player acceptance** \-- In each configuration, you have the option to require that all players accept participation in a proposed match. To enable this feature, set *AcceptanceRequired* to true and specify a time limit for player acceptance. Players have the option to accept or reject a proposed match, and a match does not move ahead to game session placement unless all matched players accept.
#' 
#' **Matchmaking status notification** \-- There are two ways to track the progress of matchmaking tickets: (1) polling ticket status with DescribeMatchmaking; or (2) receiving notifications with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). To use notifications, you first need to set up an SNS topic to receive the notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration (see [Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-notification.html)). Since notifications promise only \"best effort\" delivery, we recommend calling `DescribeMatchmaking` if no notifications are received within 30 seconds.

Format is `arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912`. These queues are used when placing game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Queues can be located in any region.
#' @param RequestTimeoutSeconds &#91;required&#93; Maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that time out can be resubmitted as needed.
#' @param AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds Length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.

#' Requests remote access to a fleet instance
#'
#' Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for debugging, gathering benchmarking data, or watching activity in real time.
#' 
#' Access requires credentials that match the operating system of the instance. For a Windows instance, Amazon GameLift returns a user name and password as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, Amazon GameLift returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client. The private key must be saved in the proper format to a `.pem` file before using. If you\'re making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret can be handled as part of the GetInstanceAccess request. (See the example later in this topic). For more information on remote access, see [Remotely Accessing an Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-remote-access.html).
#' 
#' To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the instance and the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve a fleet\'s instance IDs by calling DescribeInstances. If successful, an InstanceAccess object is returned containing the instance\'s IP address and a set of credentials.

#' Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet
#'
#' Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet\'s hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet\'s capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.
#' 
#' Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.
#' 
#' You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO\_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy\--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with DeleteScalingPolicy.
#' 
#' Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in [Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html).
#' 
#' **Target-based policy**
#' 
#' A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet\'s hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet\'s buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.
#' 
#' For example, you might choose to maintain a 10\% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet\'s available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10\% buffer.
#' 
#' To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it\'s successfully created. If the fleet\'s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.
#' 
#' **Rule-based policy**
#' 
#' A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.
#' 
#' For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20\% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10\%.\"
#' 
#' A policy\'s rule statement has the following structure:
#' 
#' If `[MetricName]` is `[ComparisonOperator]` `[Threshold]` for `[EvaluationPeriods]` minutes, then `[ScalingAdjustmentType]` to/by `[ScalingAdjustment]`.
#' 
#' To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
#' 
#' If `[PercentIdleInstances]` is `[GreaterThanThreshold]` `[20]` for `[15]` minutes, then `[PercentChangeInCapacity]` to/by `[10]`.
#' 
#' To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they\'re successfully created. If the fleet\'s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

#' Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them in a specified order
#'
#' Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them in a specified order. You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:
#' 
#' -   **gameSessionId** \-- Unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a `GameSessionId` or `GameSessionArn` value.
#' 
#' -   **gameSessionName** \-- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.
#' 
#' -   **gameSessionProperties** \-- Custom data defined in a game session\'s `GameProperty` parameter. `GameProperty` values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair \"gameMode:brawl\", specify the following: `gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl"`. All custom data values are searched as strings.
#' 
#' -   **maximumSessions** \-- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession.
#' 
#' -   **creationTimeMillis** \-- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.
#' 
#' -   **playerSessionCount** \-- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.
#' 
#' -   **hasAvailablePlayerSessions** \-- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.
#' 
#' Returned values for `playerSessionCount` and `hasAvailablePlayerSessions` change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.
#' 
#' To search or sort, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID, and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. If successful, a collection of GameSession objects matching the request is returned. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
#' 
#' You can search for game sessions one fleet at a time only. To find game sessions across multiple fleets, you must search each fleet separately and combine the results. This search feature finds only game sessions that are in `ACTIVE` status. To locate games in statuses other than active, use DescribeGameSessionDetails.

#'   NextToken = "string"
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param FleetId Unique identifier for a fleet to search for active game sessions. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.
#' @param AliasId Unique identifier for an alias associated with the fleet to search for active game sessions. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.
#' @param FilterExpression String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in `ACTIVE` status.
#' 
#' A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:
#' 
#' -   **Operand** \-- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`, `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`, `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
#' 
#' -   **Comparator** \-- Valid comparators are: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
#' 
#' -   **Value** \-- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators `=` and `<>`. For example, the following filter expression searches on `gameSessionName`: \"`FilterExpression\": \"gameSessionName = \'Matt\\\'s Awesome Game 1\'\"`.
#' 
#' To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` and parentheses as needed. For example: `x AND y AND NOT z`, `NOT (x OR y)`.
#' 
#' Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:
#' 
#' 1.  `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
#' 
#' 2.  Parentheses
#' 
#' 3.  NOT
#' 
#' 4.  AND
#' 
#' 5.  OR
#' 
#' For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: `"maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"`.
#' @param SortExpression Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following elements:
#' 
#' -   **Operand** \-- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`, `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`, `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
#' 
#' -   **Order** \-- Valid sort orders are `ASC` (ascending) and `DESC` (descending).
#' 
#' For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions first: `"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"`. Results with a null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.
#' @param Limit Maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with `NextToken` to get results as a set of sequential pages. The maximum number of results returned is 20, even if this value is not set or is set higher than 20.
#' @param NextToken Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.

#' Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see CreateGameSessionQueue)
#'
#' Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see CreateGameSessionQueue). When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue\'s destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out.
#' 
#' A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request.
#' 
#' When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue\'s destinations are listed in preference order.
#' 
#' Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each region\'s average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players.
#' 
#' To place a new game session request, specify the following:
#' 
#' -   The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings
#' 
#' -   A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request
#' 
#' -   (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player)
#' 
#' -   Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)
#' 
#' If successful, a new game session placement is created.
#' 
#' To track the status of a placement request, call DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request\'s status. If the status is `FULFILLED`, a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and region are referenced. If the placement request times out, you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different queue.

#' Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session
#'
#' Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This operation can be used to add players to matched games that start with fewer than the maximum number of players or to replace players when they drop out. By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the match criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You can backfill a match anytime after a game session has been created.
#' 
#' To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game session\'s ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that describes all current players in the game session. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. The ticket is placed in the matchmaker\'s ticket pool and processed. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed. For more detail how to set up backfilling, see [Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-backfill.html).
#' 
#' The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to the initial matchmaking process. The matchmaker searches the pool and groups tickets together to form potential matches, allowing only one backfill ticket per potential match. Once the a match is formed, the matchmaker creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in the match are updated with the game session\'s connection information, and the GameSession object is updated to include matchmaker data on the new players. For more detail on how match backfill requests are processed, see [How Amazon GameLift FlexMatch Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-intro.html).

#' Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players
#'
#' Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a `MatchmakingConfiguration`. For complete information on setting up and using FlexMatch, see the topic [Adding FlexMatch to Your Game](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-intro.html).
#' 
#' To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to `QUEUED`. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches.
#' 
#' **Tracking ticket status** \-- A couple of options are available for tracking the status of matchmaking requests:
#' 
#' -   Polling \-- Call `DescribeMatchmaking`. This operation returns the full ticket object, including current status and (for completed tickets) game session connection info. We recommend polling no more than once every 10 seconds.
#' 
#' -   Notifications \-- Get event notifications for changes in ticket status using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). Notifications are easy to set up (see CreateMatchmakingConfiguration) and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling. We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not guaranteed) and call `DescribeMatchmaking` only when notifications are not received within 30 seconds.
#' 
#' **Processing a matchmaking request** \-- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking request as follows:
#' 
#' 1.  Your client code submits a `StartMatchmaking` request for one or more players and tracks the status of the request ticket.
#' 
#' 2.  FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to the next status.
#' 
#' 3.  If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the tickets move into status `REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`. This status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call AcceptMatch for each player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see `AcceptMatch` for more details).
#' 
#' 4.  Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status `PLACING`. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data.

#' Updates capacity settings for a fleet
#'
#' Updates capacity settings for a fleet. Use this action to specify the number of EC2 instances (hosts) that you want this fleet to contain. Before calling this action, you may want to call DescribeEC2InstanceLimits to get the maximum capacity based on the fleet\'s EC2 instance type.
#' 
#' Specify minimum and maximum number of instances. Amazon GameLift will not change fleet capacity to values fall outside of this range. This is particularly important when using auto-scaling (see PutScalingPolicy) to allow capacity to adjust based on player demand while imposing limits on automatic adjustments.
#' 
#' To update fleet capacity, specify the fleet ID and the number of instances you want the fleet to host. If successful, Amazon GameLift starts or terminates instances so that the fleet\'s active instance count matches the desired instance count. You can view a fleet\'s current capacity information by calling DescribeFleetCapacity. If the desired instance count is higher than the instance type\'s limit, the \"Limit Exceeded\" exception occurs.

#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; Unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration to update.
#' @param Description Descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking configuration.
#' @param GameSessionQueueArns Amazon Resource Name ([ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html)) that is assigned to a game session queue and uniquely identifies it. Format is `arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912`. These queues are used when placing game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Queues can be located in any region.
#' @param RequestTimeoutSeconds Maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that time out can be resubmitted as needed.
#' @param AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds Length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.
#' @param AcceptanceRequired Flag that determines whether or not a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE.
#' @param RuleSetName Unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same region.
#' @param NotificationTarget SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications. See [Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-notification.html) for more information.
#' @param AdditionalPlayerCount Number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration\'s rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match.
#' @param CustomEventData Information to attached to all events related to the matchmaking configuration.
#' @param GameProperties Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see [Start a Game Session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession)). This information is added to the new GameSession object that is created for a successful match.
#' @param GameSessionData Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see [Start a Game Session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession)). This information is added to the new GameSession object that is created for a successful match.

#' Updates the current run-time configuration for the specified fleet, which tells Amazon GameLift how to launch server processes on instances in the fleet
#'
#' Updates the current run-time configuration for the specified fleet, which tells Amazon GameLift how to launch server processes on instances in the fleet. You can update a fleet\'s run-time configuration at any time after the fleet is created; it does not need to be in an `ACTIVE` status.
#' 
#' To update run-time configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a `RuntimeConfiguration` object with the updated collection of server process configurations.
#' 
#' Each instance in a Amazon GameLift fleet checks regularly for an updated run-time configuration and changes how it launches server processes to comply with the latest version. Existing server processes are not affected by the update; they continue to run until they end, while Amazon GameLift simply adds new server processes to fit the current run-time configuration. As a result, the run-time configuration changes are applied gradually as existing processes shut down and new processes are launched in Amazon GameLift\'s normal process recycling activity.
