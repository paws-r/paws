\title{Retrieves the current status of fleet capacity for one or more fleets}
\usage{
describe_fleet_capacity(FleetIds = NULL, Limit = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetIds}{Unique identifier for a fleet(s) to retrieve capacity information for. To request capacity information for all fleets, leave this parameter empty.}

\item{Limit}{Maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with \code{NextToken} to get results as a set of sequential pages. This parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.}

\item{NextToken}{Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value. This parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.}
}
\description{
Retrieves the current status of fleet capacity for one or more fleets. This information includes the number of instances that have been requested for the fleet and the number currently active. You can request capacity for all fleets, or specify a list of one or more fleet IDs. When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a FleetCapacity object is returned for each requested fleet ID. When specifying a list of fleet IDs, attribute objects are returned only for fleets that currently exist.
}
\details{
Some API actions may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.
