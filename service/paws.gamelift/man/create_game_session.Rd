\usage{
create_game_session(FleetId = NULL, AliasId = NULL,
  MaximumPlayerSessionCount, Name = NULL, GameProperties = NULL,
  CreatorId = NULL, GameSessionId = NULL, IdempotencyToken = NULL,
  GameSessionData = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetId}{Unique identifier for a fleet to create a game session in. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.}

\item{AliasId}{Unique identifier for an alias associated with the fleet to create a game session in. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.}

\item{MaximumPlayerSessionCount}{[required] Maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game session.}

\item{Name}{Descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session names do not need to be unique.}

\item{GameProperties}{Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession}{Start a Game Session}).}

\item{CreatorId}{Unique identifier for a player or entity creating the game session. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists) that limits the number of concurrent active game sessions one player can have.}

\item{GameSessionId}{\emph{This parameter is no longer preferred. Please use \code{IdempotencyToken} instead.} Custom string that uniquely identifies a request for a new game session. Maximum token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the new game session's ID. (A game session ARN has the following format: \code{arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token>}.)}

\item{IdempotencyToken}{Custom string that uniquely identifies a request for a new game session. Maximum token length is 48 characters. If provided, this string is included in the new game session's ID. (A game session ARN has the following format: \code{arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token>}.) Idempotency tokens remain in use for 30 days after a game session has ended; game session objects are retained for this time period and then deleted.}

\item{GameSessionData}{Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession}{Start a Game Session}).}

\description{
Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an \code{ACTIVE} status before a game session can be created in it.
}
\details{
To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game session. If successful, a GameSession object is returned containing the game session properties and other settings you specified.

\strong{Idempotency tokens.} You can add a token that uniquely identifies game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result. All response values are the same with the exception of game session status, which may change.

\strong{Resource creation limits.} If you are creating a game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the policy for this new game session request.

\strong{Player acceptance policy.} By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using UpdateGameSession to change the game session's player session creation policy.

\strong{Game session logs.} Logs are retained for all active game sessions for 14 days. To access the logs, call GetGameSessionLogUrl to download the log files.
