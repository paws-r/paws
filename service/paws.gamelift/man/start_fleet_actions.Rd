start_fleet_actions(FleetId, Actions)

\item{FleetId}{[required] Unique identifier for a fleet}

\item{Actions}{[required] List of actions to restart on the fleet.}
}
\description{
Resumes activity on a fleet that was suspended with StopFleetActions. Currently, this operation is used to restart a fleet's auto-scaling activity.
}
\details{
To start fleet actions, specify the fleet ID and the type of actions to restart. When auto-scaling fleet actions are restarted, Amazon GameLift once again initiates scaling events as triggered by the fleet's scaling policies. If actions on the fleet were never stopped, this operation will have no effect. You can view a fleet's stopped actions using DescribeFleetAttributes.
