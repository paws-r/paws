}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] Unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration to update.}

\item{Description}{Descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking configuration.}

\item{GameSessionQueueArns}{Amazon Resource Name (\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html}{ARN}) that is assigned to a game session queue and uniquely identifies it. Format is \code{arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912}. These queues are used when placing game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Queues can be located in any region.}

\item{RequestTimeoutSeconds}{Maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that time out can be resubmitted as needed.}

\item{AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds}{Length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.}

\item{AcceptanceRequired}{Flag that determines whether or not a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE.}

\item{RuleSetName}{Unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same region.}

\item{NotificationTarget}{SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-notification.html}{Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking} for more information.}

\item{AdditionalPlayerCount}{Number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match.}

\item{CustomEventData}{Information to attached to all events related to the matchmaking configuration.}

\item{GameProperties}{Set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession}{Start a Game Session}). This information is added to the new GameSession object that is created for a successful match.}

\item{GameSessionData}{Set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process in the GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession}{Start a Game Session}). This information is added to the new GameSession object that is created for a successful match.}
