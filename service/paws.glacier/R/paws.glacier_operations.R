#' This operation aborts a multipart upload identified by the upload ID.
#' 
#' After the Abort Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot upload any more parts to the multipart upload or complete the multipart upload. Aborting a completed upload fails. However, aborting an already-aborted upload will succeed, for a short time. For more information about uploading a part and completing a multipart upload, see UploadMultipartPart and CompleteMultipartUpload.
#' 
#' This operation is idempotent.
#' 
#' An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

#' You call this operation to inform Amazon Glacier that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Amazon Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts
#'
#' You call this operation to inform Amazon Glacier that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Amazon Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Amazon Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.
#' 
#' In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html). On the server side, Amazon Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Amazon Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.
#' 
#' Additionally, Amazon Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Amazon Glacier returns an error and the operation fails.
#' 
#' Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.

#' 
#' If the job output is large, then you can use a range to retrieve a portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output in smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job output you want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks of data at a time, which is a total of eight Get Job Output requests. You use the following process to download the job output:
#' 
#' 1.  Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate byte range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received.
#' 
#' 2.  Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree hash of the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client and compare it with the checksum you received in the response to ensure you received all the expected data.
#' 
#' 3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output data, each time specifying the appropriate byte range.
#' 
#' 4.  After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to find the checksum of the entire output. Using the DescribeJob API, obtain job information of the job that provided you the output. The response includes the checksum of the entire archive stored in Amazon Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire archive content with no errors.

#' This operation initiates a multipart upload
#'
#' This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see UploadMultipartPart).
#' 
#' When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.
#' 
#' Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.
#' 
#' You don\'t need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.
#' 
#' After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon Glacier removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Amazon Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours.
#' 
#' An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

#' This operation initiates the vault locking process by doing the following:
#' 
#' -   Installing a vault lock policy on the specified vault.
#' 
#' -   Setting the lock state of vault lock to `InProgress`.
#' 
#' -   Returning a lock ID, which is used to complete the vault locking process.
#' 
#' You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this policy can be up to 20 KB in size. For more information about vault lock policies, see [Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock-policy.html).
#' 
#' You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the vault lock enters the `InProgress` state. After the 24 hour window ends, the lock ID expires, the vault automatically exits the `InProgress` state, and the vault lock policy is removed from the vault. You call CompleteVaultLock to complete the vault locking process by setting the state of the vault lock to `Locked`.
#' 
#' After a vault lock is in the `Locked` state, you cannot initiate a new vault lock for the vault.
#' 
#' You can abort the vault locking process by calling AbortVaultLock. You can get the state of the vault lock by calling GetVaultLock. For more information about the vault locking process, [Amazon Glacier Vault Lock](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html).
#' 
#' If this operation is called when the vault lock is in the `InProgress` state, the operation returns an `AccessDeniedException` error. When the vault lock is in the `InProgress` state you must call AbortVaultLock before you can initiate a new vault lock policy.

#' This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are in-progress and jobs that have recently finished
#'
#' This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are in-progress and jobs that have recently finished. The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation time.
#' 
#' Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists.
#' 
#' The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response `Marker` field. If there are no more jobs to list, the `Marker` field is set to `null`. If there are more jobs to list, the `Marker` field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the marker request parameter to the `Marker` value for that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request.
#' 
#' You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by specifying the `limit` parameter in the request. The default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit.
#' 
#' Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional `statuscode` parameter or `completed` parameter, or both. Using the `statuscode` parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match either the `InProgress`, `Succeeded`, or `Failed` status. Using the `completed` parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were completed (`true`) or jobs that were not completed (`false`).

#' This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific events happen to a vault. By default, you don\'t get any notifications.
#' 
#' To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the `notification-configuration` subresource of the vault. The request should include a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific events for which you want Amazon Glacier to send notifications to the topic.
#' 
#' Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to publish notifications to the topic. You can configure a vault to publish a notification for the following vault events:
#' 
#' -   **ArchiveRetrievalCompleted** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an archive retrieval is completed (InitiateJob). The status of the completed job can be \"Succeeded\" or \"Failed\". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from DescribeJob.
#' 
#' -   **InventoryRetrievalCompleted** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed (InitiateJob). The status of the completed job can be \"Succeeded\" or \"Failed\". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from DescribeJob.
#' 
#' An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any permissions by default.

#' This operation adds an archive to a vault
#'
#' This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous operation, and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Amazon Glacier returns the archive ID in the `x-amz-archive-id` header of the response.
#' 
#' You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.
#' 
#' You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html).
#' 
#' You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see InitiateJob. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list.
#' 
#' Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description.

#' This operation uploads a part of an archive
#'
#' This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload archive parts in any order. You can also upload them in parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload.
#' 
#' Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:
#' 
#' -   **SHA256 tree hash does not match**To ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don\'t match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html).
#' 
#' -   **Part size does not match**The size of each part except the last must match the size specified in the corresponding InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.
#' 
#'     If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.
#' 
#' -   **Range does not align**The byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.
#' 
#' This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data.
