}
\arguments{
\item{accountId}{[required] The \code{AccountId} value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '\code{-}' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.}

\item{TagKeys}{A list of tag keys. Each corresponding tag is removed from the vault.}

\description{
This operation removes one or more tags from the set of tags attached to a vault. For more information about tags, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/tagging.html}{Tagging Amazon Glacier Resources}. This operation is idempotent. The operation will be successful, even if there are no tags attached to the vault.
