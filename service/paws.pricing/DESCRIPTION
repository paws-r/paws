Description: AWS Price List Service API (AWS Price List Service)
    is a centralized and convenient way to programmatically query Amazon
    Web Services for services, products, and pricing information. The AWS
    Price List Service uses standardized product attributes such as
    `Location`, `Storage Class`, and `Operating System`, and provides
    prices at the SKU level. You can use the AWS Price List Service to
    build cost control and scenario planning tools, reconcile billing
    data, forecast future spend for budgeting purposes, and provide cost
    benefit analysis that compare your internal workloads with AWS.
