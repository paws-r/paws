\usage{
redshift_copy_cluster_snapshot(SourceSnapshotIdentifier,
  SourceSnapshotClusterIdentifier, TargetSnapshotIdentifier,
  ManualSnapshotRetentionPeriod)
}
\arguments{
\item{SourceSnapshotIdentifier}{[required] The identifier for the source snapshot.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be the identifier for a valid automated snapshot whose state is
\code{available}.
}}

\item{SourceSnapshotClusterIdentifier}{The identifier of the cluster the source snapshot was created from. This
parameter is required if your IAM user has a policy containing a

\item First character must be a letter.

\description{
Copies the specified automated cluster snapshot to a new manual cluster
snapshot. The source must be an automated snapshot and it must be in the
available state.
}
\details{
When you delete a cluster, Amazon Redshift deletes any automated
snapshots of the cluster. Also, when the retention period of the
snapshot expires, Amazon Redshift automatically deletes it. If you want
to keep an automated snapshot for a longer period, you can make a manual
copy of the snapshot. Manual snapshots are retained until you delete
them.

For more information about working with snapshots, go to \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-snapshots.html}{Amazon Redshift Snapshots}
in the \emph{Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide}.
