\title{Returns information about the specified HSM client certificate}
\usage{
redshift_describe_hsm_client_certificates(
  HsmClientCertificateIdentifier, MaxRecords, Marker, TagKeys, TagValues)
}
\arguments{
\item{HsmClientCertificateIdentifier}{The identifier of a specific HSM client certificate for which you want
information. If no identifier is specified, information is returned for
all HSM client certificates owned by your AWS customer account.}

\item{MaxRecords}{The maximum number of response records to return in each call. If the
number of remaining response records exceeds the specified \code{MaxRecords}
value, a value is returned in a \code{marker} field of the response. You can
retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the
returned marker value.

Default: \code{100}

Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.}

\item{Marker}{An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a set
of response records. When the results of a DescribeHsmClientCertificates
request exceed the value specified in \code{MaxRecords}, AWS returns a value
in the \code{Marker} field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of
response records by providing the returned marker value in the \code{Marker}
parameter and retrying the request.}

\item{TagKeys}{A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching HSM client
certificates that are associated with the specified key or keys. For
example, suppose that you have HSM client certificates that are tagged
with keys called \code{owner} and \code{environment}. If you specify both of these
tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the HSM
client certificates that have either or both of these tag keys
associated with them.}

\item{TagValues}{A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching HSM
client certificates that are associated with the specified tag value or
values. For example, suppose that you have HSM client certificates that
are tagged with values called \code{admin} and \code{test}. If you specify both of
these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with
the HSM client certificates that have either or both of these tag values
associated with them.}
}
\description{
Returns information about the specified HSM client certificate. If no
certificate ID is specified, returns information about all the HSM
certificates owned by your AWS customer account.
}
\details{
If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon
Redshift returns all HSM client certificates that match any combination
of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have \code{owner} and
\code{environment} for tag keys, and \code{admin} and \code{test} for tag values, all
HSM client certificates that have any combination of those values are
returned.

If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, HSM client
certificates are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or
values associated with them.
