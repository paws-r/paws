\title{paws.lightsail: Amazon Lightsail}
\description{
Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started
    with AWS for developers who just need virtual private servers.
    Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly
    - a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management,
    and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You manage those
    Lightsail servers through the Lightsail console or by using the API or
    command-line interface (CLI).
