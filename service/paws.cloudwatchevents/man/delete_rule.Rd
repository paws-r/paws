}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name of the rule.}

\item{Force}{If this is a managed rule, created by an AWS service on your behalf, you must specify \code{Force} as \code{True} to delete the rule. This parameter is ignored for rules that are not managed rules. You can check whether a rule is a managed rule by using \code{DescribeRule} or \code{ListRules} and checking the \code{ManagedBy} field of the response.}

Deletes the specified rule.
}
\details{
Before you can delete the rule, you must remove all targets, using RemoveTargets.

When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to the deleted rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

Managed rules are rules created and managed by another AWS service on your behalf. These rules are created by those other AWS services to support functionality in those services. You can delete these rules using the \code{Force} option, but you should do so only if you are sure the other service is not still using that rule.
