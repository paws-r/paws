\title{paws.elbv2: Elastic Load Balancing}
\description{
A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across
    targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the
    availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the
    health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic
    only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept
    incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are
    configured with a protocol and port number for connections from
    clients to the load balancer. You configure a target group with a
    protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the
    targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the
    health status of the targets.
