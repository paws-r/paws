\title{Retrieves the IdentityID associated with a DeveloperUserIdentifier or the list of DeveloperUserIdentifiers associated with an IdentityId for an existing identity}
\usage{
lookup_developer_identity(IdentityPoolId, IdentityId = NULL,
  DeveloperUserIdentifier = NULL, MaxResults = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{IdentityPoolId}{[required] An identity pool ID in the format REGION:GUID.}

\item{IdentityId}{A unique identifier in the format REGION:GUID.}

\item{DeveloperUserIdentifier}{A unique ID used by your backend authentication process to identify a user. Typically, a developer identity provider would issue many developer user identifiers, in keeping with the number of users.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of identities to return.}

\item{NextToken}{A pagination token. The first call you make will have \code{NextToken} set to null. After that the service will return \code{NextToken} values as needed. For example, let's say you make a request with \code{MaxResults} set to 10, and there are 20 matches in the database. The service will return a pagination token as a part of the response. This token can be used to call the API again and get results starting from the 11th match.}

\description{
Retrieves the \code{IdentityID} associated with a \code{DeveloperUserIdentifier} or the list of \code{DeveloperUserIdentifier}s associated with an \code{IdentityId} for an existing identity. Either \code{IdentityID} or \code{DeveloperUserIdentifier} must not be null. If you supply only one of these values, the other value will be searched in the database and returned as a part of the response. If you supply both, \code{DeveloperUserIdentifier} will be matched against \code{IdentityID}. If the values are verified against the database, the response returns both values and is the same as the request. Otherwise a \code{ResourceConflictException} is thrown.
