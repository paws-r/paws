\usage{
describe_classic_link_instances(Filters = NULL, DryRun = NULL,
  InstanceIds = NULL, MaxResults = NULL, NextToken = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Filters}{One or more filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{group-id} - The ID of a VPC security group that's associated with the instance.
\item \code{instance-id} - The ID of the instance.
\item \code{tag}:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{vpc-id} - The ID of the VPC to which the instance is linked.

\code{vpc-id} - The ID of the VPC that the instance is linked to.
}}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{InstanceIds}{One or more instance IDs. Must be instances linked to a VPC through ClassicLink.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned \code{NextToken} value. This value can be between 5 and 1000. If \code{MaxResults} is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned. You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same request.

Constraint: If the value is greater than 1000, we return only 1000 items.}

\item{NextToken}{The token to retrieve the next page of results.}
}
\description{
Describes one or more of your linked EC2-Classic instances. This request only returns information about EC2-Classic instances linked to a VPC through ClassicLink. You cannot use this request to return information about other instances.
