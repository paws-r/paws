\usage{
modify_instance_placement(InstanceId, Affinity = NULL, GroupName = NULL,
  HostId = NULL, Tenancy = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{InstanceId}{The ID of the instance that you are modifying.}

\item{Affinity}{The affinity setting for the instance.}

\item{GroupName}{The name of the placement group in which to place the instance. For spread placement groups, the instance must have a tenancy of \code{default}. For cluster placement groups, the instance must have a tenancy of \code{default} or \code{dedicated}.

To remove an instance from a placement group, specify an empty string ("").}

\item{HostId}{The ID of the Dedicated Host with which to associate the instance.}

\item{Tenancy}{The tenancy for the instance.}
}
\description{
Modifies the placement attributes for a specified instance. You can do the following:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Modify the affinity between an instance and a \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-overview.html}{Dedicated Host}. When affinity is set to \code{host} and the instance is not associated with a specific Dedicated Host, the next time the instance is launched, it is automatically associated with the host on which it lands. If the instance is restarted or rebooted, this relationship persists.
\item Change the Dedicated Host with which an instance is associated.
\item Change the instance tenancy of an instance from \code{host} to \code{dedicated}, or from \code{dedicated} to \code{host}.
\item Move an instance to or from a \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html}{placement group}.
}

At least one attribute for affinity, host ID, tenancy, or placement group name must be specified in the request. Affinity and tenancy can be modified in the same request.

To modify the host ID, tenancy, or placement group for an instance, the instance must be in the \code{stopped} state.
