\title{Requests a VPC peering connection between two VPCs: a requester VPC that you own and an accepter VPC with which to create the connection}
\usage{
create_vpc_peering_connection(DryRun = NULL, PeerOwnerId = NULL,
  PeerVpcId = NULL, VpcId = NULL, PeerRegion = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{PeerOwnerId}{The AWS account ID of the owner of the accepter VPC.

Default: Your AWS account ID}

\item{PeerVpcId}{The ID of the VPC with which you are creating the VPC peering connection. You must specify this parameter in the request.}

\item{VpcId}{The ID of the requester VPC. You must specify this parameter in the request.}

\item{PeerRegion}{The region code for the accepter VPC, if the accepter VPC is located in a region other than the region in which you make the request.

Default: The region in which you make the request.}
}
\description{
Requests a VPC peering connection between two VPCs: a requester VPC that you own and an accepter VPC with which to create the connection. The accepter VPC can belong to another AWS account and can be in a different Region to the requester VPC. The requester VPC and accepter VPC cannot have overlapping CIDR blocks.
}
\details{
Limitations and rules apply to a VPC peering connection. For more information, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/vpc-peering-basics.html#vpc-peering-limitations}{limitations} section in the \emph{VPC Peering Guide}.

The owner of the accepter VPC must accept the peering request to activate the peering connection. The VPC peering connection request expires after 7 days, after which it cannot be accepted or rejected.

If you create a VPC peering connection request between VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks, the VPC peering connection has a status of \code{failed}.
