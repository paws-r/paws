\usage{
describe_vpc_endpoint_connections(DryRun = NULL, Filters = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL, NextToken = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{Filters}{One or more filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{service-id} - The ID of the service.
\item \code{vpc-endpoint-owner} - The AWS account number of the owner of the endpoint.
\item \code{vpc-endpoint-state} - The state of the endpoint (\code{pendingAcceptance} | \code{pending} | \code{available} | \code{deleting} | \code{deleted} | \code{rejected} | \code{failed}).
\item \code{vpc-endpoint-id} - The ID of the endpoint.
}}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned \code{NextToken} value. This value can be between 5 and 1000; if \code{MaxResults} is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned.}

\item{NextToken}{The token to retrieve the next page of results.}
