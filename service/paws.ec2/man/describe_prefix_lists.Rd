\description{
Describes available AWS services in a prefix list format, which includes the prefix list name and prefix list ID of the service and the IP address range for the service. A prefix list ID is required for creating an outbound security group rule that allows traffic from a VPC to access an AWS service through a gateway VPC endpoint. Currently, the services that support this action are Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.
