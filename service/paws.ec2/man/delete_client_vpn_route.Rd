\description{
Deletes a route from a Client VPN endpoint. You can only delete routes that you manually added using the \strong{CreateClientVpnRoute} action. You cannot delete routes that were automatically added when associating a subnet. To remove routes that have been automatically added, disassociate the target subnet from the Client VPN endpoint.
