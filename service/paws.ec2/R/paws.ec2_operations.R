#' @param Description A description for the new AMI in the destination region.
#' @param Encrypted Specifies whether the destination snapshots of the copied image should be encrypted. You can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot, but you cannot create an unencrypted copy of an encrypted snapshot. The default CMK for EBS is used unless you specify a non-default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK using `KmsKeyId`. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' @param KmsKeyId An identifier for the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating the encrypted volume. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for EBS is used. If a `KmsKeyId` is specified, the `Encrypted` flag must also be set.
#' 
#' The CMK identifier may be provided in any of the following formats:
#' 
#' -   Key ID
#' 
#' -   Key alias, in the form `alias/ExampleAlias ExampleAlias `
#' 
#' -   ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the `key` namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1*:*012345678910*:key/*abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef*.
#'

#' Copies a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3
#'
#' Copies a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can copy the snapshot within the same region or from one region to another. You can use the snapshot to create EBS volumes or Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). The snapshot is copied to the regional endpoint that you send the HTTP request to.
#' 
#' Copies of encrypted EBS snapshots remain encrypted. Copies of unencrypted snapshots remain unencrypted, unless the `Encrypted` flag is specified during the snapshot copy operation. By default, encrypted snapshot copies use the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK); however, you can specify a non-default CMK with the `KmsKeyId` parameter.
#' 
#' To copy an encrypted snapshot that has been shared from another account, you must have permissions for the CMK used to encrypt the snapshot.
#' 
#' Snapshots created by copying another snapshot have an arbitrary volume ID that should not be used for any purpose.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Copying an Amazon EBS Snapshot](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

#'   SourceRegion = "string",
#'   SourceSnapshotId = "string",
#'   DryRun = TRUE|FALSE
#' )
#'
#' @param Description A description for the EBS snapshot.
#' @param DestinationRegion The destination region to use in the `PresignedUrl` parameter of a snapshot copy operation. This parameter is only valid for specifying the destination region in a `PresignedUrl` parameter, where it is required.
#' 
#' The snapshot copy is sent to the regional endpoint that you sent the HTTP request to (for example, `ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). With the AWS CLI, this is specified using the `--region` parameter or the default region in your AWS configuration file.
#' @param Encrypted Specifies whether the destination snapshot should be encrypted. You can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot, but you cannot use it to create an unencrypted copy of an encrypted snapshot. Your default CMK for EBS is used unless you specify a non-default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK using `KmsKeyId`. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' @param KmsKeyId An identifier for the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating the encrypted volume. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for EBS is used. If a `KmsKeyId` is specified, the `Encrypted` flag must also be set.
#' 
#' The CMK identifier may be provided in any of the following formats:
#' 
#' -   Key ID
#' 
#' -   Key alias
#' 
#' -   ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the `key` namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1*:*012345678910*:key/*abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef*.

#' 
#' AWS parses `KmsKeyId` asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. The action will eventually fail.
#' @param PresignedUrl When you copy an encrypted source snapshot using the Amazon EC2 Query API, you must supply a pre-signed URL. This parameter is optional for unencrypted snapshots. For more information, see [Query Requests](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html).
#' 
#' The `PresignedUrl` should use the snapshot source endpoint, the `CopySnapshot` action, and include the `SourceRegion`, `SourceSnapshotId`, and `DestinationRegion` parameters. The `PresignedUrl` must be signed using AWS Signature Version 4. Because EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, the signing algorithm for this parameter uses the same logic that is described in [Authenticating Requests by Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference*. An invalid or improperly signed `PresignedUrl` will cause the copy operation to fail asynchronously, and the snapshot will move to an `error` state.
#' @param SourceRegion &#91;required&#93; The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.
#' @param SourceSnapshotId &#91;required&#93; The ID of the EBS snapshot to copy.
#' @param DryRun Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

#' Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes
#'
#' Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes.
#' 
#' Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. This gives you the flexibility to selectively add capacity reservations and still get the Regional RI discounts for that usage. By creating Capacity Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to Amazon EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it. For more information, see [Capacity Reservations](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' Your request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if Amazon EC2 does not have sufficient capacity to fulfill the request. If your request fails due to Amazon EC2 capacity constraints, either try again at a later time, try in a different Availability Zone, or request a smaller capacity reservation. If your application is flexible across instance types and sizes, try to create a Capacity Reservation with different instance attributes.
#' 
#' Your request could also fail if the requested quantity exceeds your On-Demand Instance limit for the selected instance type. If your request fails due to limit constraints, increase your On-Demand Instance limit for the required instance type and try again. For more information about increasing your instance limits, see [Amazon EC2 Service Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

#' @param InstancePlatform &#91;required&#93; The type of operating system for which to reserve capacity.
#' @param AvailabilityZone &#91;required&#93; The Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.
#' @param Tenancy Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:
#' 
#' -   `default` - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other AWS accounts.
#' 
#' -   `dedicated` - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single AWS account.
#' @param InstanceCount &#91;required&#93; The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.
#' @param EbsOptimized Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-optimized instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn\'t available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.
#' @param EphemeralStorage Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports instances with temporary, block-level storage.
#' @param EndDate The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation\'s state changes to `expired` when it reaches its end date and time.
#' 
#' You must provide an `EndDate` value if `EndDateType` is `limited`. Omit `EndDate` if `EndDateType` is `unlimited`.
#' 
#' If the `EndDateType` is `limited`, the Capacity Reservation is cancelled within an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.
#' @param EndDateType Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:
#' 
#' -   `unlimited` - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an `EndDate` if the `EndDateType` is `unlimited`.
#' 
#' -   `limited` - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time. You must provide an `EndDate` value if the `EndDateType` value is `limited`.
#' @param InstanceMatchCriteria Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:
#' 
#' -   `open` - The Capacity Reservation automatically matches all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run in the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.
#' 
#' -   `targeted` - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.
#' 
#' Default: `open`
#' @param TagSpecifications The tags to apply to the Capacity Reservation during launch.
#' @param DryRun Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

(The device on the AWS side of the VPN connection is the virtual private gateway.) You must provide the Internet-routable IP address of the customer gateway\'s external interface. The IP address must be static and may be behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
#' 
#' For devices that use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), you can also provide the device\'s BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN). You can use an existing ASN assigned to your network. If you don\'t have an ASN already, you can use a private ASN (in the 64512 - 65534 range).

#' Creates a set of DHCP options for your VPC
#'
#' Creates a set of DHCP options for your VPC. After creating the set, you must associate it with the VPC, causing all existing and new instances that you launch in the VPC to use this set of DHCP options. The following are the individual DHCP options you can specify. For more information about the options, see [RFC 2132](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt).
#' 
#' -   `domain-name-servers` - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas. ITo have your instance to receive a custom DNS hostname as specified in `domain-name`, you must set `domain-name-servers` to a custom DNS server.
#' 
#' -   `domain-name` - If you\'re using AmazonProvidedDNS in `us-east-1`, specify `ec2.internal`. If you\'re using AmazonProvidedDNS in another region, specify `region.compute.internal` (for example, `ap-northeast-1.compute.internal`). Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, `MyCompany.com`). This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. **Important**: Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP options set is associated with a VPC that has instances with multiple operating systems, specify only one domain name.
#' 
#' -   `ntp-servers` - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.
#' 
#' -   `netbios-name-servers` - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.
#' 
#' -   `netbios-node-type` - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that you specify 2 (broadcast and multicast are not currently supported). For more information about these node types, see [RFC 2132](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt).
#' 
#' Your VPC automatically starts out with a set of DHCP options that includes only a DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). If you create a set of options, and if your VPC has an internet gateway, make sure to set the `domain-name-servers` option either to `AmazonProvidedDNS` or to a domain name server of your choice.

#' @param ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy Indicates whether running instances should be terminated if the total target capacity of the EC2 Fleet is decreased below the current size of the EC2 Fleet.
#' @param LaunchTemplateConfigs &#91;required&#93; The configuration for the EC2 Fleet.
#' @param TargetCapacitySpecification &#91;required&#93; The `TotalTargetCapacity`, `OnDemandTargetCapacity`, `SpotTargetCapacity`, and `DefaultCapacityType` structure.
#' @param TerminateInstancesWithExpiration Indicates whether running instances should be terminated when the EC2 Fleet expires.
#' @param Type The type of the request. By default, the EC2 Fleet places an asynchronous request for your desired capacity, and maintains it by replenishing interrupted Spot Instances (`maintain`). A value of `instant` places a synchronous one-time request, and returns errors for any instances that could not be launched. A value of `request` places an asynchronous one-time request without maintaining capacity or submitting requests in alternative capacity pools if capacity is unavailable. For more information, see [EC2 Fleet Request Types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-configuration-strategies.html#ec2-fleet-request-type) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' @param ValidFrom The start date and time of the request, in UTC format (for example, *YYYY*-*MM*-*DD*T*HH*:*MM*:*SS*Z). The default is to start fulfilling the request immediately.
#' @param ValidUntil The end date and time of the request, in UTC format (for example, *YYYY*-*MM*-*DD*T*HH*:*MM*:*SS*Z). At this point, no new EC2 Fleet requests are placed or able to fulfill the request. The default end date is 7 days from the current date.
#' @param ReplaceUnhealthyInstances Indicates whether EC2 Fleet should replace unhealthy instances.
#' @param TagSpecifications The key-value pair for tagging the EC2 Fleet request on creation. The value for `ResourceType` must be `fleet`, otherwise the fleet request fails. To tag instances at launch, specify the tags in the [launch template](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html#create-launch-template). For information about tagging after launch, see [Tagging Your Resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#tag-resources).

#' Creates one or more flow logs to capture information about IP traffic for a specific network interface, subnet, or VPC
#'
#' Creates one or more flow logs to capture information about IP traffic for a specific network interface, subnet, or VPC.
#' 
#' Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow. For more information, see [Flow Log Records](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records) in the *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log records are published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group. When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log records for all of the monitored network interfaces are published to a single log file object that is stored in the specified bucket.

#' Creates an entry (a rule) in a network ACL with the specified rule number
#'
#' Creates an entry (a rule) in a network ACL with the specified rule number. Each network ACL has a set of numbered ingress rules and a separate set of numbered egress rules. When determining whether a packet should be allowed in or out of a subnet associated with the ACL, we process the entries in the ACL according to the rule numbers, in ascending order. Each network ACL has a set of ingress rules and a separate set of egress rules.
#' 
#' We recommend that you leave room between the rule numbers (for example, 100, 110, 120, \...), and not number them one right after the other (for example, 101, 102, 103, \...). This makes it easier to add a rule between existing ones without having to renumber the rules.
#' 
#' After you add an entry, you can\'t modify it; you must either replace it, or create an entry and delete the old one.

#' Creates a route in a route table within a VPC
#'
#' Creates a route in a route table within a VPC.

#' You must specify one of the following targets: internet gateway or virtual private gateway, NAT instance, NAT gateway, VPC peering connection, network interface, or egress-only internet gateway.
#' 
#' When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most specific match. For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address `192.0.2.3`, and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:
#' 
#' -   `192.0.2.0/24` (goes to some target A)

#' Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3
#'
#' Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save data before shutting down an instance.
#' 
#' When a snapshot is created, any AWS Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot.
#' 
#' You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is `pending`.
#' 
#' To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
#' 
#' Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated snapshots always remain protected.
#' 
#' You can tag your snapshots during creation. For more information, see [Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

#' Creates a subnet in an existing VPC
#'
#' Creates a subnet in an existing VPC.
#' 
#' When you create each subnet, you provide the VPC ID and IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet. After you create a subnet, you can\'t change its CIDR block. The size of the subnet\'s IPv4 CIDR block can be the same as a VPC\'s IPv4 CIDR block, or a subset of a VPC\'s IPv4 CIDR block. If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the subnets\' CIDR blocks must not overlap. The smallest IPv4 subnet (and VPC) you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IPv4 addresses), and the largest uses a /16 netmask (65,536 IPv4 addresses).
#' 
#' If you\'ve associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can create a subnet with an IPv6 CIDR block that uses a /64 prefix length.
#' 
#' AWS reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet\'s CIDR block. They\'re not available for use.
#' 
#' If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they\'re set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle.
#' 
#' If you launch an instance in a VPC using an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, the IP address doesn\'t change if you stop and restart the instance (unlike a similar instance launched outside a VPC, which gets a new IP address when restarted). It\'s therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they\'re all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available.
#'

#'   )
#' )
#'
#' @param AvailabilityZone &#91;required&#93; The Availability Zone in which to create the volume. Use DescribeAvailabilityZones to list the Availability Zones that are currently available to you.
#' @param Encrypted Specifies whether the volume should be encrypted. Encrypted Amazon EBS volumes may only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted. There is no way to create an encrypted volume from an unencrypted snapshot or vice versa. If your AMI uses encrypted volumes, you can only launch it on supported instance types. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' @param Iops The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) to provision for the volume, with a maximum ratio of 50 IOPS/GiB. Range is 100 to 64,000 IOPS for volumes in most regions. Maximum IOPS of 64,000 is guaranteed only on [Nitro-based instances](AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances). Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Volume Types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter is valid only for Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes.
#' @param KmsKeyId An identifier for the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating the encrypted volume. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for EBS is used. If a `KmsKeyId` is specified, the `Encrypted` flag must also be set.
#' 
#' The CMK identifier may be provided in any of the following formats:
#' 
#' -   Key ID
#' 
#' -   Key alias
#' 
#' -   ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the `key` namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1*:*012345678910*:key/*abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef*.
#' 
#' -   ARN using key alias. The alias ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the `alias` namespace, and then the CMK alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1*:*012345678910*:alias/*ExampleAlias*.
#' 
#' AWS parses `KmsKeyId` asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. The action will eventually fail.
#' @param Size The size of the volume, in GiBs.
#' 
#' Constraints: 1-16,384 for `gp2`, 4-16,384 for `io1`, 500-16,384 for `st1`, 500-16,384 for `sc1`, and 1-1,024 for `standard`. If you specify a snapshot, the volume size must be equal to or larger than the snapshot size.
#' 
#' Default: If you\'re creating the volume from a snapshot and don\'t specify a volume size, the default is the snapshot size.
#' @param SnapshotId The snapshot from which to create the volume.
#' @param VolumeType The volume type. This can be `gp2` for General Purpose SSD, `io1` for Provisioned IOPS SSD, `st1` for Throughput Optimized HDD, `sc1` for Cold HDD, or `standard` for Magnetic volumes.
#' 
#' Defaults: If no volume type is specified, the default is `standard` in us-east-1, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, us-west-2, us-west-1, sa-east-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-northeast-2, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ap-south-1, us-gov-west-1, and cn-north-1. In all other regions, EBS defaults to `gp2`.
#' @param DryRun Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
#' @param TagSpecifications The tags to apply to the volume during creation.

#' The list of snapshots returned can be modified by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or AWS accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.
#' 
#' If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results.
#' 
#' If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the `OwnerIds` option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the AWS account IDs of the specified owners, `amazon` for snapshots owned by Amazon, or `self` for snapshots that you own.
#' 
#' If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify AWS account IDs (if you own the snapshots), `self` for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or `all` for public snapshots.
#' 
#' If you are describing a long list of snapshots, you can paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The `MaxResults` parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the list of results exceeds your `MaxResults` value, then that number of results is returned along with a `NextToken` value that can be passed to a subsequent `DescribeSnapshots` request to retrieve the remaining results.

#'
#' @param Filters One or more filters.
#' 
#' -   `description` - A description of the snapshot.
#' 
#' -   `owner-alias` - Value from an Amazon-maintained list (`amazon` \| `aws-marketplace` \| `microsoft`) of snapshot owners. Not to be confused with the user-configured AWS account alias, which is set from the IAM console.
#' 
#' -   `owner-id` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the snapshot.
#' 
#' -   `progress` - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).
#' 
#' -   `snapshot-id` - The snapshot ID.
#' 
#' -   `start-time` - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.
#' 
#' -   `status` - The status of the snapshot (`pending` \| `completed` \| `error`).
#' 
#' -   `tag`:\<key\> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.
#' 
#' -   `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
#' 
#' -   `volume-id` - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.
#' 
#' -   `volume-size` - The size of the volume, in GiB.
#' @param MaxResults The maximum number of snapshot results returned by `DescribeSnapshots` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `DescribeSnapshots` only returns `MaxResults` results in a single page along with a `NextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `DescribeSnapshots` request with the returned `NextToken` value. This value can be between 5 and 1000; if `MaxResults` is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then `DescribeSnapshots` returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the snapshot IDs parameter in the same request.
#' @param NextToken The `NextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `DescribeSnapshots` request where `MaxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `NextToken` value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.
#' @param OwnerIds Returns the snapshots owned by the specified owner. Multiple owners can be specified.
#' @param RestorableByUserIds One or more AWS accounts IDs that can create volumes from the snapshot.
#' @param SnapshotIds One or more snapshot IDs.
#' 
#' Default: Describes snapshots for which you have launch permissions.
#' @param DryRun Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.

#' Describes the status of the specified volumes
#'
#' Describes the status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume\'s underlying host. If the volume\'s underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event.
#' 
#' The `DescribeVolumeStatus` operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:
#' 
#' *Status*: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are `ok`, `impaired` , `warning`, or `insufficient-data`. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is `ok`. If the check fails, the overall status is `impaired`. If the status is `insufficient-data`, then the checks may still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see [Monitoring the Status of Your Volumes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' *Events*: Reflect the cause of a volume status and may require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an `impaired` status, then the volume event might be `potential-data-inconsistency`. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and may have inconsistent data.
#' 
#' *Actions*: Reflect the actions you may have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is `impaired` and the volume event shows `potential-data-inconsistency`, then the action shows `enable-volume-io`. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency.
#' 
#' Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the `error` state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

#' Detaches an EBS volume from an instance
#'
#' Detaches an EBS volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount any file systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the volume.

#' 
#' AWS parses `KmsKeyId` asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. This action will eventually report failure.
#' 
#' The specified CMK must exist in the region that the AMI is being copied to.

#' @param DryRun Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
#' @param EbsOptimized Specifies whether the instance is optimized for Amazon EBS I/O. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn\'t available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.
#' @param EnaSupport Set to `true` to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the instance.
#' 
#' This option is supported only for HVM instances. Specifying this option with a PV instance can make it unreachable.
#' @param Groups &#91;EC2-VPC&#93; Changes the security groups of the instance. You must specify at least one security group, even if it\'s just the default security group for the VPC. You must specify the security group ID, not the security group name.
#' @param InstanceId &#91;required&#93; The ID of the instance.
#' @param InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior Specifies whether an instance stops or terminates when you initiate shutdown from the instance (using the operating system command for system shutdown).
#' @param InstanceType Changes the instance type to the specified value. For more information, see [Instance Types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html). If the instance type is not valid, the error returned is `InvalidInstanceAttributeValue`.
#' @param Kernel Changes the instance\'s kernel to the specified value. We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [PV-GRUB](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html).
#' @param Ramdisk Changes the instance\'s RAM disk to the specified value. We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [PV-GRUB](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html).
#' @param SriovNetSupport Set to `simple` to enable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 Virtual Function interface for the instance.
#' 
#' There is no way to disable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 Virtual Function interface at this time.
#' 
#' This option is supported only for HVM instances. Specifying this option with a PV instance can make it unreachable.
#' @param UserData Changes the instance\'s user data to the specified value. If you are using an AWS SDK or command line tool, base64-encoding is performed for you, and you can load the text from a file. Otherwise, you must provide base64-encoded text.
#' @param Value A new value for the attribute. Use only with the `kernel`, `ramdisk`, `userData`, `disableApiTermination`, or `instanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior` attribute.

#' Modifies the specified Spot Fleet request.
#' 
#' While the Spot Fleet request is being modified, it is in the `modifying` state.
#' 
#' To scale up your Spot Fleet, increase its target capacity. The Spot Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the Spot Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is `lowestPrice`, the Spot Fleet launches instances using the Spot pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is `diversified`, the Spot Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot pools.
#' 
#' To scale down your Spot Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the Spot Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the Spot Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is `lowestPrice`, the Spot Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is `diversified`, the Spot Fleet terminates instances across the Spot pools. Alternatively, you can request that the Spot Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually.

#' You can modify several parameters of an existing EBS volume, including volume size, volume type, and IOPS capacity. If your EBS volume is attached to a current-generation EC2 instance type, you may be able to apply these changes without stopping the instance or detaching the volume from it. For more information about modifying an EBS volume running Linux, see [Modifying the Size, IOPS, or Type of an EBS Volume on Linux](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html). For more information about modifying an EBS volume running Windows, see [Modifying the Size, IOPS, or Type of an EBS Volume on Windows](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html).
#' 
#' When you complete a resize operation on your volume, you need to extend the volume\'s file-system size to take advantage of the new storage capacity. For information about extending a Linux file system, see [Extending a Linux File System](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-linux).

#' 
#' You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/).

#' -   Enable/disable communication over the peering connection between instances in your VPC and an EC2-Classic instance that\'s linked to the peer VPC.
#' 
#' -   Enable/disable the ability to resolve public DNS hostnames to private IP addresses when queried from instances in the peer VPC.
#' 
#' If the peered VPCs are in the same AWS account, you can enable DNS resolution for queries from the local VPC. This ensures that queries from the local VPC resolve to private IP addresses in the peer VPC. This option is not available if the peered VPCs are in different AWS accounts or different regions. For peered VPCs in different AWS accounts, each AWS account owner must initiate a separate request to modify the peering connection options. For inter-region peering connections, you must use the region for the requester VPC to modify the requester VPC peering options and the region for the accepter VPC to modify the accepter VPC peering options. To verify which VPCs are the accepter and the requester for a VPC peering connection, use the DescribeVpcPeeringConnections command.

#' Registers an AMI
#'
#' Registers an AMI. When you\'re creating an AMI, this is the final step you must complete before you can launch an instance from the AMI. For more information about creating AMIs, see [Creating Your Own AMIs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' For Amazon EBS-backed instances, CreateImage creates and registers the AMI in a single request, so you don\'t have to register the AMI yourself.
#' 
#' You can also use `RegisterImage` to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using the block device mapping. For more information, see [Launching a Linux Instance from a Backup](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-launch-snapshot.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' You can\'t register an image where a secondary (non-root) snapshot has AWS Marketplace product codes.
#' 
#' Some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), use the EC2 billing product code associated with an AMI to verify the subscription status for package updates. Creating an AMI from an EBS snapshot does not maintain this billing code, and instances launched from such an AMI are not able to connect to package update infrastructure. If you purchase a Reserved Instance offering for one of these Linux distributions and launch instances using an AMI that does not contain the required billing code, your Reserved Instance is not applied to these instances.
#' 
#' To create an AMI for operating systems that require a billing code, see CreateImage.
#' 
#' If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new image.

#' Creates a Spot Fleet request
#'
#' Creates a Spot Fleet request.
#' 
#' The Spot Fleet request specifies the total target capacity and the On-Demand target capacity. Amazon EC2 calculates the difference between the total capacity and On-Demand capacity, and launches the difference as Spot capacity.
#' 
#' You can submit a single request that includes multiple launch specifications that vary by instance type, AMI, Availability Zone, or subnet.
#' 
#' By default, the Spot Fleet requests Spot Instances in the Spot pool where the price per unit is the lowest. Each launch specification can include its own instance weighting that reflects the value of the instance type to your application workload.
#' 
#' Alternatively, you can specify that the Spot Fleet distribute the target capacity across the Spot pools included in its launch specifications. By ensuring that the Spot Instances in your Spot Fleet are in different Spot pools, you can improve the availability of your fleet.
#' 
#' You can specify tags for the Spot Instances. You cannot tag other resource types in a Spot Fleet request because only the `instance` resource type is supported.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Spot Fleet Requests](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*.

#'
#' @param AvailabilityZoneGroup The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests.
#' 
#' When you specify an Availability Zone group in a Spot Instance request, all Spot Instances in the request are launched in the same Availability Zone. Instance proximity is maintained with this parameter, but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group applies only to requests for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any additional Spot Instance requests that are specified with the same Availability Zone group name are launched in that same Availability Zone, as long as at least one instance from the group is still active.
#' 
#' If there is no active instance running in the Availability Zone group that you specify for a new Spot Instance request (all instances are terminated, the request is expired, or the maximum price you specified falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2 launches the instance in any Availability Zone where the constraint can be met. Consequently, the subsequent set of Spot Instances could be placed in a different zone from the original request, even if you specified the same Availability Zone group.
#' 
#' Default: Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone.
#' @param BlockDurationMinutes The required duration for the Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks), in minutes. This value must be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360).
#' 
#' The duration period starts as soon as your Spot Instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration period, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates.
#' 
#' You can\'t specify an Availability Zone group or a launch group if you specify a duration.
#' @param ClientToken Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see [How to Ensure Idempotency](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*.
#' @param DryRun Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
#' @param InstanceCount The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch.
#' 
#' Default: 1
#' @param LaunchGroup The instance launch group. Launch groups are Spot Instances that launch together and terminate together.
#' 
#' Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually
#' @param LaunchSpecification The launch specification.
#' @param SpotPrice The maximum price per hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. The default is the On-Demand price.
#' @param Type The Spot Instance request type.
#' 
#' Default: `one-time`
#' @param ValidFrom The start date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until all instances launch, the request expires, or the request is canceled. If the request is persistent, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until it expires or is canceled.
#' @param ValidUntil The end date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request remains active until all instances launch, the request is canceled, or this date is reached. If the request is persistent, it remains active until it is canceled or this date is reached. The default end date is 7 days from the current date.
#' @param InstanceInterruptionBehavior The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The default is `terminate`.
#'
#' @examples
#' # This example creates a one-time Spot Instance request for five instances
#' # in the specified Availability Zone. If your account supports EC2-VPC
#' # only, Amazon EC2 launches the instances in the default subnet of the

#' Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions
#'
#' Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions.
#' 
#' You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options. The following rules apply:
#' 
#' -   &#91;EC2-VPC&#93; If you don\'t specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you. If you don\'t have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request.
#' 
#' -   &#91;EC2-Classic&#93; If don\'t specify an Availability Zone, we choose one for you.
#' 
#' -   Some instance types must be launched into a VPC. If you do not have a default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails. For more information, see [Instance Types Available Only in a VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#vpc-only-instance-types).
#' 
#' -   &#91;EC2-VPC&#93; All instances have a network interface with a primary private IPv4 address. If you don\'t specify this address, we choose one from the IPv4 range of your subnet.
#' 
#' -   Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more information, see [Instance Types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html).
#' 
#' -   If you don\'t specify a security group ID, we use the default security group. For more information, see [Security Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html).
#' 
#' -   If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has not subscribed, the request fails.
#' 
#' You can create a [launch template](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html), which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using RunInstances, you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters.
#' 
#' To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances.
#' 
#' An instance is ready for you to use when it\'s in the `running` state. You can check the state of your instance using DescribeInstances. You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see CreateTags and [Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html).
#' 
#' Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more information, see [Key Pairs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' For troubleshooting, see [What To Do If An Instance Immediately Terminates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_InstanceStraightToTerminated.html), and [Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

#' @param BlockDeviceMappings One or more block device mapping entries. You can\'t specify both a snapshot ID and an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the basis for a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used for the volume encryption status.
#' @param ImageId The ID of the AMI, which you can get by calling DescribeImages. An AMI is required to launch an instance and must be specified here or in a launch template.
#' @param InstanceType The instance type. For more information, see [Instance Types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' Default: `m1.small`
#' @param Ipv6AddressCount &#91;EC2-VPC&#93; A number of IPv6 addresses to associate with the primary network interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the range of your subnet. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign specific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You can specify this option if you\'ve specified a minimum number of instances to launch.
#' @param Ipv6Addresses &#91;EC2-VPC&#93; Specify one or more IPv6 addresses from the range of the subnet to associate with the primary network interface. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in the same request. You cannot specify this option if you\'ve specified a minimum number of instances to launch.
#' @param KernelId The ID of the kernel.
#' 
#' We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [PV-GRUB](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedkernels.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' @param KeyName The name of the key pair. You can create a key pair using CreateKeyPair or ImportKeyPair.
#' 
#' If you do not specify a key pair, you can\'t connect to the instance unless you choose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log in.
#' @param MaxCount &#91;required&#93; The maximum number of instances to launch. If you specify more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches the largest possible number of instances above `MinCount`.
#' 
#' Constraints: Between 1 and the maximum number you\'re allowed for the specified instance type. For more information about the default limits, and how to request an increase, see [How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2) in the Amazon EC2 FAQ.
#' @param MinCount &#91;required&#93; The minimum number of instances to launch. If you specify a minimum that is more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches no instances.
#' 
#' Constraints: Between 1 and the maximum number you\'re allowed for the specified instance type. For more information about the default limits, and how to request an increase, see [How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2) in the Amazon EC2 General FAQ.
#' @param Monitoring The monitoring for the instance.
#' @param Placement The placement for the instance.
#' @param RamdiskId The ID of the RAM disk.
#' 
#' We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [PV-GRUB](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedkernels.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' @param SecurityGroupIds One or more security group IDs. You can create a security group using CreateSecurityGroup.
#' 
#' Default: Amazon EC2 uses the default security group.
#' @param SecurityGroups &#91;EC2-Classic, default VPC&#93; One or more security group names. For a nondefault VPC, you must use security group IDs instead.
#' 
#' Default: Amazon EC2 uses the default security group.
#' @param SubnetId &#91;EC2-VPC&#93; The ID of the subnet to launch the instance into.
#' @param UserData The user data to make available to the instance. For more information, see [Running Commands on Your Linux Instance at Launch](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) (Linux) and [Adding User Data](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-add-user-data) (Windows). If you are using a command line tool, base64-encoding is performed for you, and you can load the text from a file. Otherwise, you must provide base64-encoded text.
#' @param AdditionalInfo Reserved.
#' @param ClientToken Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see [Ensuring Idempotency](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html).
#' 
#' Constraints: Maximum 64 ASCII characters
#' @param DisableApiTermination If you set this parameter to `true`, you can\'t terminate the instance using the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API; otherwise, you can. To change this attribute to `false` after launch, use ModifyInstanceAttribute. Alternatively, if you set `InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior` to `terminate`, you can terminate the instance by running the shutdown command from the instance.
#' 
#' Default: `false`
#' @param DryRun Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is `DryRunOperation`. Otherwise, it is `UnauthorizedOperation`.
#' @param EbsOptimized Indicates whether the instance is optimized for Amazon EBS I/O. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal Amazon EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn\'t available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS-optimized instance.
#' 
#' Default: `false`
#' @param IamInstanceProfile The IAM instance profile.
#' @param InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior Indicates whether an instance stops or terminates when you initiate shutdown from the instance (using the operating system command for system shutdown).
#' 
#' Default: `stop`
#' @param NetworkInterfaces One or more network interfaces.
#' @param PrivateIpAddress &#91;EC2-VPC&#93; The primary IPv4 address. You must specify a value from the IPv4 address range of the subnet.
#' 
#' Only one private IP address can be designated as primary. You can\'t specify this option if you\'ve specified the option to designate a private IP address as the primary IP address in a network interface specification. You cannot specify this option if you\'re launching more than one instance in the request.
#' @param ElasticGpuSpecification An elastic GPU to associate with the instance.
#' @param ElasticInferenceAccelerators An elastic inference accelerator.
#' @param TagSpecifications The tags to apply to the resources during launch. You can only tag instances and volumes on launch. The specified tags are applied to all instances or volumes that are created during launch. To tag a resource after it has been created, see CreateTags.
#' @param LaunchTemplate The launch template to use to launch the instances. Any parameters that you specify in RunInstances override the same parameters in the launch template. You can specify either the name or ID of a launch template, but not both.
#' @param InstanceMarketOptions The market (purchasing) option for the instances.
#' 
#' For RunInstances, persistent Spot Instance requests are only supported when **InstanceInterruptionBehavior** is set to either `hibernate` or `stop`.
#' @param CreditSpecification The credit option for CPU usage of the instance. Valid values are `standard` and `unlimited`. To change this attribute after launch, use ModifyInstanceCreditSpecification. For more information, see [Burstable Performance Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' Default: `standard` (T2 instances) or `unlimited` (T3 instances)
#' @param CpuOptions The CPU options for the instance. For more information, see [Optimizing CPU Options](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-optimize-cpu.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' @param CapacityReservationSpecification Information about the Capacity Reservation targeting option.
#' @param HibernationOptions Indicates whether an instance is enabled for hibernation. For more information, see [Hibernate Your Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' @param LicenseSpecifications The license configurations.

For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see [Instance Lifecycle](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
#' 
#' When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Stopping Your Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

#' Shuts down one or more instances
#'
#' Shuts down one or more instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds.
#' 
#' If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.
#' 
#' Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour).
#' 
#' By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.
#' 
#' You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the `DeleteOnTermination` block device mapping parameter set to `true` are automatically deleted.
