\title{TerminateJobFlows shuts a list of clusters (job flows) down}
\usage{
emr_terminate_job_flows(JobFlowIds)
}
\arguments{
\item{JobFlowIds}{[required] A list of job flows to be shutdown.}
}
\description{
TerminateJobFlows shuts a list of clusters (job flows) down. When a job
flow is shut down, any step not yet completed is canceled and the EC2
instances on which the cluster is running are stopped. Any log files not
already saved are uploaded to Amazon S3 if a LogUri was specified when
the cluster was created.
}
\details{
The maximum number of clusters allowed is 10. The call to
\code{TerminateJobFlows} is asynchronous. Depending on the configuration of
the cluster, it may take up to 1-5 minutes for the cluster to completely
terminate and release allocated resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.
