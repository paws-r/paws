\title{Registers instances that were created outside of AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a specified stack}
\usage{
register_instance(StackId, Hostname = NULL, PublicIp = NULL,
  PrivateIp = NULL, RsaPublicKey = NULL,
  RsaPublicKeyFingerprint = NULL, InstanceIdentity = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{StackId}{[required] The ID of the stack that the instance is to be registered with.}

\item{Hostname}{The instance's hostname.}

\item{PublicIp}{The instance's public IP address.}

\item{PrivateIp}{The instance's private IP address.}

\item{RsaPublicKey}{The instances public RSA key. This key is used to encrypt communication between the instance and the service.}

\item{RsaPublicKeyFingerprint}{The instances public RSA key fingerprint.}

\item{InstanceIdentity}{An InstanceIdentity object that contains the instance's identity.}
}
\description{
Registers instances that were created outside of AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a specified stack.
}
\details{
We do not recommend using this action to register instances. The complete registration operation includes two tasks: installing the AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent on the instance, and registering the instance with the stack. \code{RegisterInstance} handles only the second step. You should instead use the AWS CLI \code{register} command, which performs the entire registration operation. For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register.html}{Registering an Instance with an AWS OpsWorks Stacks Stack}.

Registered instances have the same requirements as instances that are created by using the CreateInstance API. For example, registered instances must be running a supported Linux-based operating system, and they must have a supported instance type. For more information about requirements for instances that you want to register, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register-registering-preparer.html}{Preparing the Instance}.

\strong{Required Permissions}: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/opsworks-security-users.html}{Managing User Permissions}.
