\arguments{
\item{HyperParameterTuningJobName}{[required] The name of the tuning job whose training jobs you want to list.}

\item{NextToken}{If the result of the previous
\code{ListTrainingJobsForHyperParameterTuningJob} request was truncated, the
response includes a \code{NextToken}. To retrieve the next set of training
jobs, use the token in the next request.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of training jobs to return. The default value is 10.}

\item{StatusEquals}{A filter that returns only training jobs with the specified status.}

\item{SortBy}{The field to sort results by. The default is \code{Name}.

If the value of this field is \code{FinalObjectiveMetricValue}, any training
