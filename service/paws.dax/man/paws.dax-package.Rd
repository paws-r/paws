\title{paws.dax: Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)}
\description{
DAX is a managed caching service engineered for
    Amazon DynamoDB. DAX dramatically speeds up database reads by caching
    frequently-accessed data from DynamoDB, so applications can access
    that data with sub-millisecond latency. You can create a DAX cluster
    easily, using the AWS Management Console. With a few simple
    modifications to your code, your application can begin taking
    advantage of the DAX cluster and realize significant improvements in
    read performance.
