\title{Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented
applications}
\usage{
xray_create_sampling_rule(SamplingRule)
}
\arguments{
\item{SamplingRule}{[required] The rule definition.}
}
\description{
Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented
applications. Services retrieve rules with GetSamplingRules, and
evaluate each rule in ascending order of \emph{priority} for each request. If
a rule matches, the service records a trace, borrowing it from the
reservoir size. After 10 seconds, the service reports back to X-Ray with
GetSamplingTargets to get updated versions of each in-use rule. The
updated rule contains a trace quota that the service can use instead of
borrowing from the reservoir.
