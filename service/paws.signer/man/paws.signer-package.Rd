\title{paws.signer: AWS Signer}
\description{
You can use Code Signing for Amazon FreeRTOS (AWS
    Signer) to sign code that you created for any of the IoT devices that
    Amazon Web Services supports. AWS Signer is integrated with Amazon
    FreeRTOS, AWS Certificate Manager, and AWS CloudTrail. Amazon FreeRTOS
    customers can use AWS Signer to sign code images before making them
    available for microcontrollers. You can use ACM to import third-party
    certificates to be used by AWS Signer. For general information about
    using AWS Signer, see the [Code Signing for Amazon FreeRTOS Developer
    Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).
