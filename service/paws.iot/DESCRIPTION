Description: AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional
    communication between Internet-connected devices (such as sensors,
    actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud.
    You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate with,
    configure rules for data processing and integration with other
    services, organize resources associated with each device (Registry),
    configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to
    authenticate devices.
