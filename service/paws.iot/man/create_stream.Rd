\title{Creates a stream for delivering one or more large files in chunks over MQTT}
\usage{
create_stream(streamId, description = NULL, files, roleArn)
}
\arguments{
\item{streamId}{[required] The stream ID.}

\item{description}{A description of the stream.}

\item{files}{[required] The files to stream.}

\item{roleArn}{[required] An IAM role that allows the IoT service principal assumes to access your S3 files.}
}
\description{
Creates a stream for delivering one or more large files in chunks over MQTT. A stream transports data bytes in chunks or blocks packaged as MQTT messages from a source like S3. You can have one or more files associated with a stream. The total size of a file associated with the stream cannot exceed more than 2 MB. The stream will be created with version 0. If a stream is created with the same streamID as a stream that existed and was deleted within last 90 days, we will resurrect that old stream by incrementing the version by 1.
