\title{Gets a list of TrainingJobSummary objects that describe the training jobs that a hyperparameter tuning job launched}
\usage{

  list_training_jobs_for_hyper_parameter_tuning_job(HyperParameterTuningJobName,
  NextToken = NULL, MaxResults = NULL, StatusEquals = NULL,
  SortBy = NULL, SortOrder = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{HyperParameterTuningJobName}{[required] The name of the tuning job whose training jobs you want to list.}

\item{NextToken}{If the result of the previous \code{ListTrainingJobsForHyperParameterTuningJob} request was truncated, the response includes a \code{NextToken}. To retrieve the next set of training jobs, use the token in the next request.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of training jobs to return. The default value is 10.}

\item{StatusEquals}{A filter that returns only training jobs with the specified status.}

\item{SortBy}{The field to sort results by. The default is \code{Name}.

If the value of this field is \code{FinalObjectiveMetricValue}, any training jobs that did not return an objective metric are not listed.}

\item{SortOrder}{The sort order for results. The default is \code{Ascending}.}
