Description: A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic
    across your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the
    availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the
    health of its registered instances and ensures that it routes traffic
    only to healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to accept
    incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are
    configured with a protocol and port number for connections from
    clients to the load balancer and a protocol and port number for
    connections from the load balancer to the instances.
