Description: Amazon Route 53 auto naming lets you configure
    public or private namespaces that your microservice applications run
    in. When instances of the service become available, you can call the
    auto naming API to register the instance, and Route 53 automatically
    creates up to five DNS records and an optional health check. Clients
    that submit DNS queries for the service receive an answer that
    contains up to eight healthy records.
