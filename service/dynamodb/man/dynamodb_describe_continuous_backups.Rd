\item{TableName}{[required] Name of the table for which the customer wants to check the continuous

}
\description{
Checks the status of continuous backups and point in time recovery on
the specified table. Continuous backups are \code{ENABLED} on all tables at
table creation. If point in time recovery is enabled,
\code{PointInTimeRecoveryStatus} will be set to ENABLED.
}
\details{
Once continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can
restore to any point in time within \code{EarliestRestorableDateTime} and
\code{LatestRestorableDateTime}.

\code{LatestRestorableDateTime} is typically 5 minutes before the current
time. You can restore your table to any point in time during the last 35
days.

You can call \code{DescribeContinuousBackups} at a maximum rate of 10 times
per second.
