\title{Shares a specified directory (DirectoryId) in your AWS account
(directory owner) with another AWS account (directory consumer)}
\usage{
directoryservice_share_directory(DirectoryId, ShareNotes, ShareTarget,
  ShareMethod)
}
\arguments{
\item{DirectoryId}{[required] Identifier of the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory that you want to
share with other AWS accounts.}

\item{ShareNotes}{A directory share request that is sent by the directory owner to the
directory consumer. The request includes a typed message to help the
directory consumer administrator determine whether to approve or reject
the share invitation.}

\item{ShareTarget}{[required] Identifier for the directory consumer account with whom the directory is
to be shared.}

\item{ShareMethod}{[required] The method used when sharing a directory to determine whether the
directory should be shared within your AWS organization
(\code{ORGANIZATIONS}) or with any AWS account by sending a directory sharing
request (\code{HANDSHAKE}).}
}
\description{
Shares a specified directory (\code{DirectoryId}) in your AWS account
(directory owner) with another AWS account (directory consumer). With
this operation you can use your directory from any AWS account and from
any Amazon VPC within an AWS Region.
}
\details{
When you share your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, AWS Directory
Service creates a shared directory in the directory consumer account.
This shared directory contains the metadata to provide access to the
directory within the directory owner account. The shared directory is
visible in all VPCs in the directory consumer account.

The \code{ShareMethod} parameter determines whether the specified directory
can be shared between AWS accounts inside the same AWS organization
(\code{ORGANIZATIONS}). It also determines whether you can share the
directory with any other AWS account either inside or outside of the
organization (\code{HANDSHAKE}).

The \code{ShareNotes} parameter is only used when \code{HANDSHAKE} is called,
which sends a directory sharing request to the directory consumer.
