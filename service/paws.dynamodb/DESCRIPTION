Description: Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database
    service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless
    scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of
    operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don\'t have
    to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration,
    replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.
