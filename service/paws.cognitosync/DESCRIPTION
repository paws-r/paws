Description: Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and
    client library that enable cross-device syncing of application-related
    user data. High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and
    Android. You can use these libraries to persist data locally so that
    it\'s available even if the device is offline. Developer credentials
    don\'t need to be stored on the mobile device to access the service.
    You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and
    credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to
    1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user
    identity.
