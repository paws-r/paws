\description{
Gets paginated records, optionally changed after a particular sync count for a dataset and identity. With Amazon Cognito Sync, each identity has access only to its own data. Thus, the credentials used to make this API call need to have access to the identity data.
}
\details{
ListRecords can be called with temporary user credentials provided by Cognito Identity or with developer credentials. You should use Cognito Identity credentials to make this API call.
