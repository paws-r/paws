\title{paws.alexaforbusiness: Alexa For Business}
\description{
Alexa for Business helps you use Alexa in your
    organization. Alexa for Business provides you with the tools to manage
    Alexa devices, enroll your users, and assign skills, at scale. You can
    build your own context-aware voice skills using the Alexa Skills Kit
    and the Alexa for Business API operations. You can also make these
    available as private skills for your organization. Alexa for Business
    makes it efficient to voice-enable your products and services, thus
    providing context-aware voice experiences for your customers. Device
    makers building with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) can create fully
    integrated solutions, register their products with Alexa for Business,
    and manage them as shared devices in their organization.
