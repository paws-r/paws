\title{Initiates a snapshot of a volume}
\usage{
create_snapshot(VolumeARN, SnapshotDescription)
}
\arguments{
\item{VolumeARN}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume. Use the ListVolumes operation to return a list of gateway volumes.}

\item{SnapshotDescription}{[required] Textual description of the snapshot that appears in the Amazon EC2 console, Elastic Block Store snapshots panel in the \strong{Description} field, and in the AWS Storage Gateway snapshot \strong{Details} pane, \strong{Description} field}
}
\description{
Initiates a snapshot of a volume.
}
\details{
AWS Storage Gateway provides the ability to back up point-in-time snapshots of your data to Amazon Simple Storage (S3) for durable off-site recovery, as well as import the data to an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). You can take snapshots of your gateway volume on a scheduled or ad-hoc basis. This API enables you to take ad-hoc snapshot. For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/managing-volumes.html#SchedulingSnapshot}{Editing a Snapshot Schedule}.

In the CreateSnapshot request you identify the volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also provide description for the snapshot. When AWS Storage Gateway takes the snapshot of specified volume, the snapshot and description appears in the AWS Storage Gateway Console. In response, AWS Storage Gateway returns you a snapshot ID. You can use this snapshot ID to check the snapshot progress or later use it when you want to create a volume from a snapshot. This operation is only supported in stored and cached volume gateway type.

To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For more information, see DescribeSnapshots or DeleteSnapshot in the \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html}{EC2 API reference}.

Volume and snapshot IDs are changing to a longer length ID format. For more information, see the important note on the \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html}{Welcome} page.
