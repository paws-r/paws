\title{Creates a virtual tape by using your own barcode}
\usage{
create_tape_with_barcode(GatewayARN, TapeSizeInBytes, TapeBarcode,
  KMSEncrypted = NULL, KMSKey = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{GatewayARN}{[required] The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that represents the gateway to associate the virtual tape with. Use the ListGateways operation to return a list of gateways for your account and region.}

\item{TapeSizeInBytes}{[required] The size, in bytes, of the virtual tape that you want to create.

The size must be aligned by gigabyte (1024*1024*1024 byte).}

\item{TapeBarcode}{[required] The barcode that you want to assign to the tape.

Barcodes cannot be reused. This includes barcodes used for tapes that have been deleted.}

\item{KMSEncrypted}{True to use Amazon S3 server side encryption with your own AWS KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.}

\item{KMSKey}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS KMS Key used for Amazon S3 server side encryption. This value can only be set when KMSEncrypted is true. Optional.}
}
\description{
Creates a virtual tape by using your own barcode. You write data to the virtual tape and then archive the tape. A barcode is unique and can not be reused if it has already been used on a tape . This applies to barcodes used on deleted tapes. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.
}
\details{
Cache storage must be allocated to the gateway before you can create a virtual tape. Use the AddCache operation to add cache storage to a gateway.
