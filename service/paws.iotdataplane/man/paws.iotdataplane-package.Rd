\title{paws.iotdataplane: AWS IoT Data Plane}
\description{
AWS IoT-Data enables secure, bi-directional
    communication between Internet-connected things (such as sensors,
    actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud.
    It implements a broker for applications and things to publish messages
    over HTTP (Publish) and retrieve, update, and delete thing shadows. A
    thing shadow is a persistent representation of your things and their
    state in the AWS cloud.
