\title{Retrieves the results of a running or completed experiment}
\usage{
cloudwatchevidently_get_experiment_results(
  baseStat = NULL,
  endTime = NULL,
  experiment,
  metricNames,
  period = NULL,
  project,
  reportNames = NULL,
  resultStats = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseStat}{The statistic used to calculate experiment results. Currently the only
valid value is \code{mean}, which uses the mean of the collected values as
the statistic.}

\item{endTime}{The date and time that the experiment ended, if it is completed. This
must be no longer than 30 days after the experiment start time.}

\item{experiment}{[required] The name of the experiment to retrieve the results of.}

\item{metricNames}{[required] The names of the experiment metrics that you want to see the results of.}

\item{period}{In seconds, the amount of time to aggregate results together.}

\item{project}{[required] The name or ARN of the project that contains the experiment that you
want to see the results of.}

\item{reportNames}{The names of the report types that you want to see. Currently,
\code{BayesianInference} is the only valid value.}

\item{resultStats}{The statistics that you want to see in the returned results.
\itemize{
\item \code{PValue} specifies to use p-values for the results. A p-value is
used in hypothesis testing to measure how often you are willing to
make a mistake in rejecting the null hypothesis. A general practice
is to reject the null hypothesis and declare that the results are
statistically significant when the p-value is less than 0.05.
\item \code{ConfidenceInterval} specifies a confidence interval for the
results. The confidence interval represents the range of values for
the chosen metric that is likely to contain the true difference
between the \code{baseStat} of a variation and the baseline. Evidently
returns the 95\% confidence interval.
\item \code{TreatmentEffect} is the difference in the statistic specified by
the \code{baseStat} parameter between each variation and the default
variation.
\item \code{BaseStat} returns the statistical values collected for the metric
for each variation. The statistic uses the same statistic specified
in the \code{baseStat} parameter. Therefore, if \code{baseStat} is \code{mean},
this returns the mean of the values collected for each variation.
}}

\item{startTime}{The date and time that the experiment started.}

\item{treatmentNames}{[required] The names of the experiment treatments that you want to see the results
for.}

\description{
Retrieves the results of a running or completed experiment. No results are available until there have been 100 events for each variation and at least 10 minutes have passed since the start of the experiment.
