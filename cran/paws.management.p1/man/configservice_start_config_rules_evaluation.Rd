Runs an on-demand evaluation for the specified Config rules against the last known configuration state of the resources. Use \code{\link[=configservice_start_config_rules_evaluation]{start_config_rules_evaluation}} when you want to test that a rule you updated is working as expected. \code{\link[=configservice_start_config_rules_evaluation]{start_config_rules_evaluation}} does not re-record the latest configuration state for your resources. It re-runs an evaluation against the last known state of your resources.
