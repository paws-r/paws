#' @param AccountId Specifies the 12-digit account ID number of the Amazon Web Services
#' account that you want to access or modify with this operation. If you
#' don't specify this parameter, it defaults to the Amazon Web Services
#' account of the identity used to call the operation. To use this
#' parameter, the caller must be an identity in the [organization's
#' management
#' account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#account)
#' or a delegated administrator account. The specified account ID must be a

#' parameter.

#' To call this operation on an account that is not a member of an
#' organization, don't specify this parameter. Instead, call the operation
#' using an identity belonging to the account whose contacts you wish to
#' retrieve or modify.
#' @param MaxResults The total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the
#' total number of items available is more than the value specified, a
#' `NextToken` is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination,
#' provide the `NextToken` value in the `starting-token` argument of a
#' subsequent command. Do not use the `NextToken` response element directly
#' outside of the Amazon Web Services CLI. For usage examples, see
#' [Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-pagination.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide*.
#' @param NextToken A token used to specify where to start paginating. This is the
