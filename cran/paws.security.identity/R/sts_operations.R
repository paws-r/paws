#'
#' @description
#' Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services resources. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html) and [Compare STS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_sts-comparison.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/sts_assume_role/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/sts_assume_role/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param RoleArn &#91;required&#93; The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.
#' @param RoleSessionName &#91;required&#93; An identifier for the assumed role session.
#' 
#' Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same
#' role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In
#' cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be
#' logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also
#' used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that
#' subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security
#' credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in
#' their CloudTrail logs.
#' 
#' For security purposes, administrators can view this field in [CloudTrail
#' logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html#cloudtrail-integration_signin-tempcreds)
#' to help identify who performed an action in Amazon Web Services. Your
#' administrator might require that you specify your user name as the
#' session name when you assume the role. For more information, see
#' [`sts:RoleSessionName`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.html#ck_rolesessionname)
#' .
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: +=,.@@-
#' @param PolicyArns The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
#' want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the
#' same account as the role.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy
#' ARNs. However, the plaintext that you use for both inline and managed
#' session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information
#' about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services
#' Service
#' Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html)
#' in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
#' 
#' An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session
#' policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary
#' format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit
#' even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The
#' `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by percentage how close
#' the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.
#' 
#' Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
#' The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's
#' identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's
#' temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to
#' access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use
#' session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
#' identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
#' information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param Policy An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session
#' policy.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns
#' new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the
#' intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session
#' policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent
#' Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that
#' owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions
#' than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is
#' being assumed. For more information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies
#' can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
#' ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid
#' character list (``U+0020`` through ``U+00FF``). It can also include the tab
#' (``U+0009``), linefeed (``U+000A``), and carriage return (``U+000D``) characters.

#' An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session
#' policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary
#' format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit
#' even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The

#' the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.
#' 
#' For more information about role session permissions, see [Session
#' policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session).
#' @param DurationSeconds The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can
#' range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
#' set for the role. The maximum session duration setting can have a value
#' from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting
#' or the administrator setting (whichever is lower), the operation fails.
#' For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your
#' administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your
#' operation fails.
#' 
#' Role chaining limits your Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services
#' API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the
#' [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] API operation to assume a role, you can
#' specify the duration of your role session with the `DurationSeconds`
#' parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12
#' hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role.
#' However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a
#' `DurationSeconds` parameter value greater than one hour, the operation
#' fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [Update
#' the maximum session duration for a
#' role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_update-role-settings.html#id_roles_update-session-duration).
#' 
#' By default, the value is set to `3600` seconds.
#' 
#' The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a
#' console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
#' The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes
#' a `SessionDuration` parameter that specifies the maximum length of the
#' console session. For more information, see [Creating a URL that Enables
#' Federated Users to Access the Amazon Web Services Management
#' Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param Tags A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists
#' of a key name and an associated value. For more information about
#' session tags, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services STS
#' Sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The
#' plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters, and the values
#' can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see [IAM
#' and STS Character
#' Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session
#' policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary
#' format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit
#' even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The
#' `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by percentage how close
#' the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.
#' 
#' You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already
#' attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with
#' the same key.
#' 
#' Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
#' means that you cannot have separate `Department` and `department` tag
#' keys. Assume that the role has the `Department`=`Marketing` tag and you
#' pass the `department`=`engineering` session tag. `Department` and
#' `department` are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed
#' in the request takes precedence over the role tag.
#' 
#' Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this
#' operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from the
#' calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an
#' inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a
#' session, see the CloudTrail logs. For more information, see [Viewing
#' Session Tags in
#' CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_ctlogs)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param TransitiveTagKeys A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If
#' you set a tag key as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes
#' to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see
#' [Chaining Roles with Session
#' Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. The transitive status of a session tag does
#' not impact its packed binary size.
#' 
#' If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are
#' passed from this session to any subsequent sessions.
#' @param ExternalId A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in
#' another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role
#' belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the
#' `ExternalId` parameter. This value can be any string, such as a
#' passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to
#' trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the
#' trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the
#' trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role,
#' rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the
#' external ID, see [How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your
#' Amazon Web Services Resources to a Third
#' Party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: +=,.@@:\\/-
#' @param SerialNumber The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the
#' user who is making the [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] call. Specify
#' this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a
#' condition that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the
#' serial number for a hardware device (such as `GAHT12345678`) or an
#' Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as
#' `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`).
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: +=/:,.@@-
#' @param TokenCode The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role
#' being assumed requires MFA. (In other words, if the policy includes a
#' condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA
#' and if the `TokenCode` value is missing or expired, the
#' [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] call returns an "access denied" error.
#' 
#' The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
#' sequence of six numeric digits.
#' @param SourceIdentity The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the
#' [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] operation. The source identity value
#' persists across [chained
#' role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#iam-term-role-chaining)
#' sessions.
#' 
#' You can require users to specify a source identity when they assume a
#' role. You do this by using the
#' [`sts:SourceIdentity`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceidentity)
#' condition key in a role trust policy. You can use source identity
#' information in CloudTrail logs to determine who took actions with a
#' role. You can use the `aws:SourceIdentity` condition key to further
#' control access to Amazon Web Services resources based on the value of
#' source identity. For more information about using source identity, see
#' [Monitor and control actions taken with assumed
#' roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: +=,.@@-. You cannot use a value that begins with the text
#' `aws:`. This prefix is reserved for Amazon Web Services internal use.
#' @param ProvidedContexts A list of previously acquired trusted context assertions in the format
#' of a JSON array. The trusted context assertion is signed and encrypted
#' by Amazon Web Services STS.
#' 
#' The following is an example of a `ProvidedContext` value that includes a
#' single trusted context assertion and the ARN of the context provider

#' @description
#' Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider. Example providers include the OAuth 2.0 providers Login with Amazon and Facebook, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider such as Google or [Amazon Cognito federated identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html).

#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/sts_assume_role_with_web_identity/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/sts_assume_role_with_web_identity/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param RoleArn &#91;required&#93; The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that the caller is assuming.
#' 
#' Additional considerations apply to Amazon Cognito identity pools that
#' assume [cross-account IAM
#' roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.html).
#' The trust policies of these roles must accept the
#' `cognito-identity.amazonaws.com` service principal and must contain the
#' `cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:aud` condition key to restrict role
#' assumption to users from your intended identity pools. A policy that

#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following

#' This parameter is optional. However, if you do not pass any session
#' policies, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions.
#' 
#' When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the
#' intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you
#' pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a
#' federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more

#' can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
#' ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid
#' character list (``U+0020`` through ``U+00FF``). It can also include the tab
#' (``U+0009``), linefeed (``U+000A``), and carriage return (``U+000D``) characters.
#' 
#' An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session
#' policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary
#' format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit
#' even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The
#' `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by percentage how close
#' the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.
#' @param PolicyArns The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
#' want to use as a managed session policy. The policies must exist in the

#' durations for federation sessions range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to
#' 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12 hours) as the
