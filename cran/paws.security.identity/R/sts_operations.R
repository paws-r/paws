#'
#' Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to
#' access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These
#' temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key,
#' and a security token. Typically, you use `AssumeRole` within your
#' account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of `AssumeRole`
#' with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see
#' [Requesting Temporary Security
#' Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)
#' and [Comparing the AWS STS API
#' operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call `AssumeRole`.
#' You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call
#' `AssumeRole`.
#' 
#' For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and
#' need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term
#' credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing
#' all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account
#' can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term
#' credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to
#' access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For
#' more information about roles, see [IAM
#' Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' **Session Duration**
#' 
#' By default, the temporary security credentials created by `AssumeRole`
#' last for one hour. However, you can use the optional `DurationSeconds`
#' parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a
#' value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
#' setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
#' hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [View
#' the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a
#' Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*. The maximum session duration limit applies when
#' you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations or the `assume-role*` CLI
#' commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations
#' to create a console URL. For more information, see [Using IAM
#' Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' **Permissions**
#' 
#' The temporary security credentials created by `AssumeRole` can be used
#' to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You
#' cannot call the AWS STS `GetFederationToken` or `GetSessionToken` API
#' operations.
#' 
#' (Optional) You can pass inline or managed [session
#' policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
#' an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
#' to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both
#' inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.
#' Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
#' The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's
#' identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's
#' temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in
#' the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant
#' more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the
#' role that is being assumed. For more information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be
#' trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's
#' trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which
#' accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account.
#' 
#' A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have
#' permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The
#' administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call
#' `AssumeRole` for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user
#' is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a
#'     different account).
#' 
#' -   Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.
#' 
#' In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy.
#' Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to
#' assume the role. For more information about trust policies and
#' resource-based policies, see [IAM
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' **Tags**
#' 
#' (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags
#' are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see
#' [Passing Session Tags in
#' STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
#' session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
#' allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
#' [Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access
#' Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
#' during role chaining. For more information, see [Chaining Roles with
#' Session
#' Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' **Using MFA with AssumeRole**
#' 
#' (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
#' when you call `AssumeRole`. This is useful for cross-account scenarios
#' to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated
#' with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role
#' being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If
#' the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume
#' the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA
#' authentication might look like the following example.
#' 
#' `"Condition": \{"Bool": \{"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true\}\}`
#' 
#' For more information, see [Configuring MFA-Protected API
#' Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide* guide.
#' 
#' To use MFA with `AssumeRole`, you pass values for the `SerialNumber` and
#' `TokenCode` parameters. The `SerialNumber` value identifies the user's
#' hardware or virtual MFA device. The `TokenCode` is the time-based
#' one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces.
#'
#' @usage
#' sts_assume_role(RoleArn, RoleSessionName, PolicyArns, Policy,
#'   DurationSeconds, Tags, TransitiveTagKeys, ExternalId, SerialNumber,
#'   TokenCode)
#'
#' @param RoleArn &#91;required&#93; The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.
#' @param RoleSessionName &#91;required&#93; An identifier for the assumed role session.
#' 
#' Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same
#' role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In
#' cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be
#' logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also
#' used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that
#' subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security
#' credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in
#' their AWS CloudTrail logs.
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: =,.@@-
#' @param PolicyArns The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
#' want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the
#' same account as the role.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy
#' ARNs. However, the plain text that you use for both inline and managed
#' session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information
#' about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service
#' Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
#' in the AWS General Reference.
#' 
#' An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
#' tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request
#' can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other
#' requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' 
#' Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
#' The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's
#' identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's
#' temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in
#' the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant
#' more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the
#' role that is being assumed. For more information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param Policy An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session
#' policy.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns
#' new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the
#' intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session
#' policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS
#' API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You
#' cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed
#' by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
#' information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies
#' can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
#' ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid
#' character list (`U+0020` through `U+00FF`). It can also include the tab
#' (`U+0009`), linefeed (`U+000A`), and carriage return (`U+000D`) characters.
#' 
#' An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
#' tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request
#' can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other
#' requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' @param DurationSeconds The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from
#' 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for
#' the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you
#' specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For
#' example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your
#' administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your
#' operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role,
#' see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a
#' Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' By default, the value is set to `3600` seconds.
#' 
#' The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a
#' console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
#' The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes
#' a `SessionDuration` parameter that specifies the maximum length of the
#' console session. For more information, see [Creating a URL that Enables
#' Federated Users to Access the AWS Management
#' Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param Tags A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists
#' of a key name and an associated value. For more information about
#' session tags, see [Tagging AWS STS
#' Sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The
#' plain text session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters, and the values
#' can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see [IAM
#' and STS Character
#' Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
#' tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request
#' can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other
#' requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' 
#' You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already
#' attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with
#' the same key.
#' 
#' Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
#' means that you cannot have separate `Department` and `department` tag
#' keys. Assume that the role has the `Department`=`Marketing` tag and you
#' pass the `department`=`engineering` session tag. `Department` and
#' `department` are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed
#' in the request takes precedence over the role tag.
#' 
#' Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this
#' operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from the
#' calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an
#' inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a
#' session, see the AWS CloudTrail logs. For more information, see [Viewing
#' Session Tags in
#' CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/session-tags.html#id_session-tags_ctlogs)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param TransitiveTagKeys A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If
#' you set a tag key as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes
#' to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see
#' [Chaining Roles with Session
#' Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. When you set session tags as transitive, the
#' session policy and session tags packed binary limit is not affected.
#' 
#' If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are
#' passed from this session to any subsequent sessions.
#' @param ExternalId A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in
#' another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role
#' belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the
#' `ExternalId` parameter. This value can be any string, such as a
#' passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to
#' trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the
#' trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the
#' trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role,
#' rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the
#' external ID, see [How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your
#' AWS Resources to a Third
#' Party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: =,.@@:/-
#' @param SerialNumber The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the
#' user who is making the `AssumeRole` call. Specify this value if the
#' trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that
#' requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a
#' hardware device (such as `GAHT12345678`) or an Amazon Resource Name
#' (ARN) for a virtual device (such as
#' `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`).
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: =,.@@-
#' @param TokenCode The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role
#' being assumed requires MFA (that is, if the policy includes a condition
#' that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA and if the
#' `TokenCode` value is missing or expired, the `AssumeRole` call returns
#' an "access denied" error.
#' 
#' The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a

#' Calling `AssumeRoleWithSAML` does not require the use of AWS security
#' credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in
#' the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for
#' your identity provider.
#' 
#' Calling `AssumeRoleWithSAML` can result in an entry in your AWS

#' @param DurationSeconds The duration, in seconds, of the role session. Your role session lasts
#' for the duration that you specify for the `DurationSeconds` parameter,
#' or until the time specified in the SAML authentication response's
#' `SessionNotOnOrAfter` value, whichever is shorter. You can provide a
#' `DurationSeconds` value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum
#' session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value
#' from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this
#' setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session
#' duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session

#' Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been
#' authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity
#' provider
#'
#' Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been
#' authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity
#' provider. Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon,
#' Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.
#' 
#' For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You
#' can use Amazon Cognito with the [AWS SDK for iOS Developer
#' Guide](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/) and the [AWS SDK for Android
#' Developer Guide](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/) to uniquely
#' identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity
#' throughout the lifetime of an application.
#' 
#' To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see [Amazon Cognito
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840)
#' in *AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide* and [Amazon Cognito
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664)
#' in the *AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Calling `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` does not require the use of AWS
#' security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for
#' example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials
#' without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also
#' don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS
#' credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a
#' token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of
#' `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` with the other API operations that produce
#' temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security
#' Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)
#' and [Comparing the AWS STS API
#' operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an
#' access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications
#' can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS
#' service API operations.
#' 
#' **Session Duration**
#' 
#' By default, the temporary security credentials created by
#' `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` last for one hour. However, you can use the
#' optional `DurationSeconds` parameter to specify the duration of your
#' session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the
#' maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a
#' value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value
#' for your role, see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a
#' Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*. The maximum session duration limit applies when
#' you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations or the `assume-role*` CLI
#' commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations
#' to create a console URL. For more information, see [Using IAM
#' Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' **Permissions**
#' 
#' The temporary security credentials created by
#' `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` can be used to make API calls to any AWS
#' service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS
#' `GetFederationToken` or `GetSessionToken` API operations.
#' 
#' (Optional) You can pass inline or managed [session
#' policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
#' an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
#' to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both
#' inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.
#' Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
#' The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's
#' identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's
#' temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in
#' the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant
#' more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the
#' role that is being assumed. For more information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' **Tags**
#' 
#' (Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web
#' identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name
#' and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see
#' [Passing Session Tags in
#' STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag keys
#' can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters.
#' For these and additional limits, see [IAM and STS Character
#' Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
#' tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request
#' can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other
#' requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' 
#' You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached
#' to the role. When you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with
#' the same key.
#' 
#' An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
#' session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
#' allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
#' [Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access
#' Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
#' during role chaining. For more information, see [Chaining Roles with
#' Session
#' Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' **Identities**
#' 
#' Before your application can call `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`, you must
#' have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a
#' role that the application can assume. The role that your application
#' assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the
#' identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified
#' in the role's trust policy.
#' 
#' Calling `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` can result in an entry in your AWS
#' CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the
#' [Subject](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims)
#' of the provided Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using
#' any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For
#' example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as
#' [suggested in the OIDC
#' specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes).

#' 
#' For example, if a user is not authorized to perform an operation that he

#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' When you pass an access key ID to this operation, it returns the ID of

#' `AKIA` are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root
#' user. Access key IDs beginning with `ASIA` are temporary credentials
#' that are created using STS operations. If the account in the response

#'
#' Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access
#' key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user.
#' A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security
#' credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate
#' network. You must call the `GetFederationToken` operation using the
#' long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is
#' appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored,
#' usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of
#' `GetFederationToken` with the other API operations that produce
#' temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security
#' Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)
#' and [Comparing the AWS STS API
#' operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
#' users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook,
#' Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case,
#' we recommend that you use [Amazon
#' Cognito](http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) or `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`.
#' For more information, see [Federation Through a Web-based Identity
#' Provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' You can also call `GetFederationToken` using the security credentials of
#' an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we
#' recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy
#' application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated
#' users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For
#' more information, see [IAM Best
#' Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' **Session duration**
#' 
#' The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900
#' seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The
#' default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary
#' credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials
#' have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
#' 
#' **Permissions**
#' 
#' You can use the temporary credentials created by `GetFederationToken` in
#' any AWS service except the following:
#' 
#' -   You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API.
#' 
#' -   You cannot call any STS operations except `GetCallerIdentity`.
#' 
#' You must pass an inline or managed [session
#' policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
#' an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
#' to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both
#' inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.
#' 
#' Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a
#' policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions.
#' When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the
#' intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you
#' pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a
#' federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more
#' permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the
#' IAM user. For more information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*. For information about using
#' `GetFederationToken` to create temporary security credentials, see
#' [GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity
#' Broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken).
#' 
#' You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a
#' resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the
#' federated user session in the `Principal` element of the policy, the
#' session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are
#' granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.
#' 
#' **Tags**
#' 
#' (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are
#' called session tags. For more information about session tags, see
#' [Passing Session Tags in
#' STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
#' session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
#' allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
#' [Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access
#' Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
#' means that you cannot have separate `Department` and `department` tag
#' keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the
#' `Department`=`Marketing` tag and you pass the `department`=`engineering`
#' session tag. `Department` and `department` are not saved as separate
#' tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over
#' the user tag.
#'
#' @usage
#' sts_get_federation_token(Name, Policy, PolicyArns, DurationSeconds,
#'   Tags)
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; The name of the federated user. The name is used as an identifier for
#' the temporary security credentials (such as `Bob`). For example, you can
#' reference the federated user name in a resource-based policy, such as in
#' an Amazon S3 bucket policy.
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters

#' 
#' The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies
#' can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
#' ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid

#' (`U+0009`), linefeed (`U+000A`), and carriage return (`U+000D`) characters.
#' 
#' An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
#' tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request
#' can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other
#' requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' @param PolicyArns The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
#' want to use as a managed session policy. The policies must exist in the

#' Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user
#'
#' Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user.
#' The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a
#' security token. Typically, you use `GetSessionToken` if you want to use
#' MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS API operations like
#' Amazon EC2 `StopInstances`. MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call
#' `GetSessionToken` and submit an MFA code that is associated with their
#' MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned
#' from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API
#' operations that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a
#' correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error. For a
#' comparison of `GetSessionToken` with the other API operations that
#' produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security
#' Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)
#' and [Comparing the AWS STS API
#' operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' **Session Duration**
#' 
#' The `GetSessionToken` operation must be called by using the long-term
#' AWS security credentials of the AWS account root user or an IAM user.
#' Credentials that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration
#' that you specify. This duration can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes)
#' up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with a default of 43,200
#' seconds (12 hours). Credentials based on account credentials can range
#' from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a
#' default of 1 hour.
#' 
#' **Permissions**
#' 
#' The temporary security credentials created by `GetSessionToken` can be
#' used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:
#' 
#' -   You cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication
#'     information is included in the request.
#' 
#' -   You cannot call any STS API *except* `AssumeRole` or
#'     `GetCallerIdentity`.
#' 
#' We recommend that you do not call `GetSessionToken` with AWS account
#' root user credentials. Instead, follow our [best
#' practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users)
#' by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary
#' permissions, and using IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS.
#' 
#' The credentials that are returned by `GetSessionToken` are based on
#' permissions associated with the user whose credentials were used to call
#' the operation. If `GetSessionToken` is called using AWS account root
#' user credentials, the temporary credentials have root user permissions.
#' Similarly, if `GetSessionToken` is called using the credentials of an
#' IAM user, the temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM
#' user.
#' 
#' For more information about using `GetSessionToken` to create temporary
#' credentials, go to [Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted
#' Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getsessiontoken)

#' @param DurationSeconds The duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain valid.
#' Acceptable durations for IAM user sessions range from 900 seconds (15

#' as the default. Sessions for AWS account owners are restricted to a
#' maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If the duration is longer than one
#' hour, the session for AWS account owners defaults to one hour.
#' @param SerialNumber The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the
#' IAM user who is making the `GetSessionToken` call. Specify this value if
#' the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA authentication. The value is
#' either the serial number for a hardware device (such as `GAHT12345678`)
#' or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as
#' `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`). You can find the device for an
