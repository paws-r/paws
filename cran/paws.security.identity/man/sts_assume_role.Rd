\title{Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to
access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to}
\usage{
sts_assume_role(RoleArn, RoleSessionName, PolicyArns, Policy,
  DurationSeconds, Tags, TransitiveTagKeys, ExternalId, SerialNumber,
  TokenCode)
}
\arguments{
\item{RoleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.}

\item{RoleSessionName}{[required] An identifier for the assumed role session.

Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same
role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In
cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be
logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also
used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that
subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security
credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in
their AWS CloudTrail logs.

The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
characters: =,.@-}

\item{PolicyArns}{The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the
same account as the role.

This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy
ARNs. However, the plain text that you use for both inline and managed
session policies can\'t exceed 2,048 characters. For more information
about ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html}{Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces}
in the AWS General Reference.

An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request
can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other
requirements. The \code{PackedPolicySize} response element indicates by
percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
upper size limit.

Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
The resulting session\'s permissions are the intersection of the role\'s
identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role\'s
temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in
the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant
more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the
role that is being assumed. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session}{Session Policies}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.}

\item{Policy}{An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session
policy.

This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns
new temporary credentials. The resulting session\'s permissions are the
intersection of the role\'s identity-based policy and the session
policies. You can use the role\'s temporary credentials in subsequent
AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You
cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed
by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session}{Session Policies}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies
can\'t exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid
character list (\code{U+0020} through \verb{U+00FF}). It can also include the tab
(\code{U+0009}), linefeed (\verb{U+000A}), and carriage return (\verb{U+000D}) characters.

An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request
can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other
requirements. The \code{PackedPolicySize} response element indicates by
percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
upper size limit.}

\item{DurationSeconds}{The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from
900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for
the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you
specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For
example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your
administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your
operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session}{View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

By default, the value is set to \code{3600} seconds.

The \code{DurationSeconds} parameter is separate from the duration of a
console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes
a \code{SessionDuration} parameter that specifies the maximum length of the
console session. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html}{Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.}

\item{Tags}{A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists
of a key name and an associated value. For more information about
session tags, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html}{Tagging AWS STS Sessions}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The
plain text session tag keys can't exceed 128 characters, and the values
can't exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length}{IAM and STS Character Limits}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request
can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the other
requirements. The \code{PackedPolicySize} response element indicates by
percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
upper size limit.

You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already
attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with
the same key.

Tag key--value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
means that you cannot have separate \code{Department} and \code{department} tag
keys. Assume that the role has the \code{Department}=\code{Marketing} tag and you
pass the \code{department}=\code{engineering} session tag. \code{Department} and
\code{department} are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed
in the request takes precedence over the role tag.

Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this
operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from the
calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an
inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a
session, see the AWS CloudTrail logs. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/session-tags.html#id_session-tags_ctlogs}{Viewing Session Tags in CloudTrail}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.}

\item{TransitiveTagKeys}{A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If
you set a tag key as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes
to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining}{Chaining Roles with Session Tags}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

This parameter is optional. When you set session tags as transitive, the
session policy and session tags packed binary limit is not affected.

If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are
passed from this session to any subsequent sessions.}

\item{ExternalId}{A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in
another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role
belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the
\code{ExternalId} parameter. This value can be any string, such as a
passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to
trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the
trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the
trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role,
rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the
external ID, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html}{How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
characters: =,.@:/-}

\item{SerialNumber}{The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the
user who is making the \code{AssumeRole} call. Specify this value if the
trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that
requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a
hardware device (such as \code{GAHT12345678}) or an Amazon Resource Name
(ARN) for a virtual device (such as
\verb{arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user}).

The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
characters: =,.@-}

\item{TokenCode}{The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role
being assumed requires MFA (that is, if the policy includes a condition
that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA and if the
\code{TokenCode} value is missing or expired, the \code{AssumeRole} call returns
an \"access denied\" error.

The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
sequence of six numeric digits.}
}
\description{
Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to
access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These
temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key,
and a security token. Typically, you use \code{AssumeRole} within your
account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of \code{AssumeRole}
with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html}{Requesting Temporary Security Credentials}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison}{Comparing the AWS STS API operations}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.
}
\details{
You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call \code{AssumeRole}.
You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call
\code{AssumeRole}.

For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and
need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term
credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing
all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account
can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term
credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to
access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For
more information about roles, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html}{IAM Roles}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

\strong{Session Duration}

By default, the temporary security credentials created by \code{AssumeRole}
last for one hour. However, you can use the optional \code{DurationSeconds}
parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a
value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session}{View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}. The maximum session duration limit applies when
you use the \verb{AssumeRole*} API operations or the \verb{assume-role*} CLI
commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations
to create a console URL. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html}{Using IAM Roles}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

\strong{Permissions}

The temporary security credentials created by \code{AssumeRole} can be used
to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You
cannot call the AWS STS \code{GetFederationToken} or \code{GetSessionToken} API
operations.

(Optional) You can pass inline or managed \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session}{session policies}
to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both
inline and managed session policies can\'t exceed 2,048 characters.
Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
The resulting session\'s permissions are the intersection of the role\'s
identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role\'s
temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in
the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant
more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the
role that is being assumed. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session}{Session Policies}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be
trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role\'s
trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which
accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account.

A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have
permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The
administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call
\code{AssumeRole} for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user
is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the
following:
\itemize{
\item Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a
different account).
\item Add the user as a principal directly in the role\'s trust policy.
}

In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy.
Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to
assume the role. For more information about trust policies and
resource-based policies, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html}{IAM Policies}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

\strong{Tags}

(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags
are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html}{Passing Session Tags in STS}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html}{Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
during role chaining. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining}{Chaining Roles with Session Tags}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

\strong{Using MFA with AssumeRole}

(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
when you call \code{AssumeRole}. This is useful for cross-account scenarios
to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated
with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role
being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If
the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume
the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA
authentication might look like the following example.

\verb{"Condition": \\\{"Bool": \\\{"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true\\\}\\\}}

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html}{Configuring MFA-Protected API Access}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide} guide.

To use MFA with \code{AssumeRole}, you pass values for the \code{SerialNumber} and
\code{TokenCode} parameters. The \code{SerialNumber} value identifies the user\'s
hardware or virtual MFA device. The \code{TokenCode} is the time-based
one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces.
