\title{Creates an IPSet, which you use to identify web requests that originate
from specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses}
\usage{
wafv2_create_ip_set(
  Name,
  Scope,
  Description = NULL,
  IPAddressVersion,
  Addresses,
  Tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an \code{IPSet} after
you create it.}

\item{Scope}{[required] Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or for a
regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load
Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API,
or an Amazon Cognito user pool.

To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N.
Virginia) as follows:
\itemize{
\item CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope:
\code{--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1}.
\item API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
}}

\item{Description}{A description of the IP set that helps with identification.}

\item{IPAddressVersion}{[required] The version of the IP addresses, either \code{IPV4} or \code{IPV6}.}

\item{Addresses}{[required] Contains an array of strings that specifies zero or more IP addresses or
blocks of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
notation. WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except for /0.

Example address strings:
\itemize{
\item To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated
from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify \verb{192.0.2.44/32}.
\item To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated
from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify
\verb{192.0.2.0/24}.
\item To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated
from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify
\code{1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128}.
\item To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated
from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to
1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify
\code{1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64}.
}

Example JSON \code{Addresses} specifications:
\itemize{
\item Empty array: \verb{"Addresses": []}
\item Array with one address: \verb{"Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32"]}
\item Array with three addresses:
\verb{"Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32", "192.0.2.0/24", "192.0.0.0/16"]}
\item INVALID specification: \verb{"Addresses": [""]} INVALID
}}

\item{Tags}{An array of key:value pairs to associate with the resource.}
}
\description{
Creates an IPSet, which you use to identify web requests that originate from specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from a ranges of IP addresses, you can configure WAF to block them using an IPSet that lists those IP addresses.
