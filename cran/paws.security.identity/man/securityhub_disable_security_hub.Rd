\usage{
securityhub_disable_security_hub()
}
\description{
Disables Security Hub in your account only in the current Region. To
disable Security Hub in all Regions, you must submit one request per
Region where you have enabled Security Hub. When you disable Security
Hub for a master account, it doesn\'t disable Security Hub for any
associated member accounts.
}
\details{
When you disable Security Hub, your existing findings and insights and
any Security Hub configuration settings are deleted after 90 days and
can\'t be recovered. Any standards that were enabled are disabled, and
your master and member account associations are removed. If you want to
save your existing findings, you must export them before you disable
Security Hub.
