\title{Declares an authentication flow and initiates sign-in for a user in the
Amazon Cognito user directory}
\usage{
cognitoidentityprovider_initiate_auth(
  AuthFlow,
  AuthParameters = NULL,
  ClientMetadata = NULL,
  ClientId,
  AnalyticsMetadata = NULL,
  UserContextData = NULL,
  Session = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{AuthFlow}{[required] The authentication flow that you want to initiate. Each \code{AuthFlow} has
linked \code{AuthParameters} that you must submit. The following are some
example flows.

\strong{USER_AUTH}

The entry point for \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-selection-sdk.html#authentication-flows-selection-choice}{choice-based authentication}
with passwords, one-time passwords, and WebAuthn authenticators. Request
a preferred authentication type or review available authentication
types. From the offered authentication types, select one in a challenge
response and then authenticate with that method in an additional
challenge response. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in
the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html}{Essentials tier}
or higher.

\strong{USER_SRP_AUTH}

Username-password authentication with the Secure Remote Password (SRP)
protocol. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication.html#Using-SRP-password-verification-in-custom-authentication-flow}{Use SRP password verification in custom authentication flow}.

\strong{REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH and REFRESH_TOKEN}

Receive new ID and access tokens when you pass a \code{REFRESH_TOKEN}
parameter with a valid refresh token as the value. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-the-refresh-token.html}{Using the refresh token}.

\strong{CUSTOM_AUTH}

Custom authentication with Lambda triggers. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-challenge.html}{Custom authentication challenge Lambda triggers}.

\strong{USER_PASSWORD_AUTH}

Client-side username-password authentication with the password sent
directly in the request. For more information about client-side and
server-side authentication, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-public-server-side.html}{SDK authorization models}.

\code{ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH} is a flow type of
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_admin_initiate_auth]{admin_initiate_auth}} and
isn't valid for InitiateAuth. \code{ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH} is a legacy
server-side username-password flow and isn't valid for InitiateAuth.}

\item{AuthParameters}{The authentication parameters. These are inputs corresponding to the
\code{AuthFlow} that you're invoking.

The required values are specific to the InitiateAuthRequest$AuthFlow.

The following are some authentication flows and their parameters. Add a
\code{SECRET_HASH} parameter if your app client has a client secret.
\itemize{
\item \code{USER_AUTH}: \code{USERNAME} (required), \code{PREFERRED_CHALLENGE}. If you
don't provide a value for \code{PREFERRED_CHALLENGE}, Amazon Cognito
responds with the \code{AvailableChallenges} parameter that specifies the
available sign-in methods.
\item \code{USER_SRP_AUTH}: \code{USERNAME} (required), \code{SRP_A} (required),
\code{DEVICE_KEY}.
\item \code{USER_PASSWORD_AUTH}: \code{USERNAME} (required), \code{PASSWORD} (required),
\code{DEVICE_KEY}.
\item \code{REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH/REFRESH_TOKEN}: \code{REFRESH_TOKEN} (required),
\code{DEVICE_KEY}.
\item \code{CUSTOM_AUTH}: \code{USERNAME} (required), \code{SECRET_HASH} (if app client
is configured with client secret), \code{DEVICE_KEY}. To start the
authentication flow with password verification, include
\code{ChallengeName: SRP_A} and \verb{SRP_A: (The SRP_A Value)}.
}

For more information about \code{SECRET_HASH}, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/signing-up-users-in-your-app.html#cognito-user-pools-computing-secret-hash}{Computing secret hash values}.
For information about \code{DEVICE_KEY}, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html}{Working with user devices in your user pool}.}

\item{ClientMetadata}{A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
certain custom workflows that this action triggers.

You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool
triggers. When you send an
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_initiate_auth]{initiate_auth}} request, Amazon
Cognito invokes the Lambda functions that are specified for various
triggers. The \code{ClientMetadata} value is passed as input to the functions
for only the following triggers.
\itemize{
\item Pre sign-up
\item Pre authentication
\item User migration
}

When Amazon Cognito invokes the functions for these triggers, it passes
a JSON payload as input to the function. This payload contains a
\code{validationData} attribute with the data that you assigned to the
\code{ClientMetadata} parameter in your
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_initiate_auth]{initiate_auth}} request. In
your function, \code{validationData} can contribute to operations that
require data that isn't in the default payload.

\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_initiate_auth]{initiate_auth}} requests
invokes the following triggers without \code{ClientMetadata} as input.
\itemize{
\item Post authentication
\item Custom message
\item Pre token generation
\item Create auth challenge
\item Define auth challenge
\item Custom email sender
\item Custom SMS sender
}

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-working-with-lambda-triggers.html}{Using Lambda triggers}
in the \emph{Amazon Cognito Developer Guide}.

When you use the \code{ClientMetadata} parameter, note that Amazon Cognito
won't do the following:
\itemize{
\item Store the \code{ClientMetadata} value. This data is available only to
Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom
workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers,
the \code{ClientMetadata} parameter serves no purpose.
\item Validate the \code{ClientMetadata} value.
\item Encrypt the \code{ClientMetadata} value. Don't send sensitive information
in this parameter.
}}

\item{ClientId}{[required] The ID of the app client that your user wants to sign in to.}

\item{AnalyticsMetadata}{Information that supports analytics outcomes with Amazon Pinpoint,
including the user's endpoint ID. The endpoint ID is a destination for
Amazon Pinpoint push notifications, for example a device identifier,
email address, or phone number.}

\item{UserContextData}{Contextual data about your user session like the device fingerprint, IP
address, or location. Amazon Cognito threat protection evaluates the
risk of an authentication event based on the context that your app
generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes API requests.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-viewing-threat-protection-app.html}{Collecting data for threat protection in applications}.}

\item{Session}{The optional session ID from a
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_confirm_sign_up]{confirm_sign_up}} API
request. You can sign in a user directly from the sign-up process with
the \code{USER_AUTH} authentication flow. When you pass the session ID to
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_initiate_auth]{initiate_auth}}, Amazon Cognito
assumes the SMS or email message one-time verification password from
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_confirm_sign_up]{confirm_sign_up}} as the
primary authentication factor. You're not required to submit this code a
second time. This option is only valid for users who have confirmed
their sign-up and are signing in for the first time within the
authentication flow session duration of the session ID.}
}
\description{
Declares an authentication flow and initiates sign-in for a user in the Amazon Cognito user directory. Amazon Cognito might respond with an additional challenge or an \code{AuthenticationResult} that contains the outcome of a successful authentication. You can't sign in a user with a federated IdP with \code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_initiate_auth]{initiate_auth}}. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication.html}{Authentication}.
