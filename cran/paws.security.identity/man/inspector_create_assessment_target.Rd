\description{
Creates a new assessment target using the ARN of the resource group that
is generated by CreateResourceGroup. If resourceGroupArn is not
specified, all EC2 instances in the current AWS account and region are
included in the assessment target. If the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_slr.html}{service-linked role}
isn't already registered, this action also creates and registers a
service-linked role to grant Amazon Inspector access to AWS Services
needed to perform security assessments. You can create up to 50
assessment targets per AWS account. You can run up to 500 concurrent
agents per AWS account. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_applications.html}{Amazon Inspector Assessment Targets}.
