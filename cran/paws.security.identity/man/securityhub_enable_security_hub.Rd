\usage{
securityhub_enable_security_hub(
  Tags = NULL,

  ControlFindingGenerator = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Tags}{The tags to add to the hub resource when you enable Security Hub.}

\item{EnableDefaultStandards}{Whether to enable the security standards that Security Hub has
designated as automatically enabled. If you don't provide a value for
\code{EnableDefaultStandards}, it is set to \code{true}. To not enable the
automatically enabled standards, set \code{EnableDefaultStandards} to
\code{false}.}

\item{ControlFindingGenerator}{This field, used when enabling Security Hub, specifies whether the
calling account has consolidated control findings turned on. If the
value for this field is set to \code{SECURITY_CONTROL}, Security Hub
generates a single finding for a control check even when the check
applies to multiple enabled standards.

If the value for this field is set to \code{STANDARD_CONTROL}, Security Hub
generates separate findings for a control check when the check applies
to multiple enabled standards.

The value for this field in a member account matches the value in the
administrator account. For accounts that aren't part of an organization,
the default value of this field is \code{SECURITY_CONTROL} if you enabled
Security Hub on or after February 23, 2023.}
