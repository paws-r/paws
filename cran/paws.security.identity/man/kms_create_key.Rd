\title{Creates a unique customer managed customer master key (CMK) in your AWS
account and Region}
\usage{
kms_create_key(Policy, Description, KeyUsage, CustomerMasterKeySpec,
  Origin, CustomKeyStoreId, BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{Policy}{The key policy to attach to the CMK.

If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:
\itemize{
\item If you don\'t set \code{BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck} to true, the key
policy must allow the principal that is making the \code{CreateKey}
request to make a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request on the CMK. This
reduces the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. For more
information, refer to the scenario in the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam}{Default Key Policy}
section of the \strong{AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide} .
\item Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for
example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay
before including the new principal in a key policy because the new
principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency}{Changes that I make are not always immediately visible}
in the \emph{AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide}.
}

If you do not provide a key policy, AWS KMS attaches a default key
policy to the CMK. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default}{Default Key Policy}
in the \emph{AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide}.

The key policy size limit is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).}

\item{Description}{A description of the CMK.

Use a description that helps you decide whether the CMK is appropriate
for a task.}

\item{KeyUsage}{Determines the cryptographic operations for which you can use the CMK.
The default value is \code{ENCRYPT_DECRYPT}. This parameter is required only
for asymmetric CMKs. You can\'t change the \code{KeyUsage} value after the
CMK is created.

Select only one valid value.
\itemize{
\item For symmetric CMKs, omit the parameter or specify \code{ENCRYPT_DECRYPT}.
\item For asymmetric CMKs with RSA key material, specify \code{ENCRYPT_DECRYPT}
or \code{SIGN_VERIFY}.
\item For asymmetric CMKs with ECC key material, specify \code{SIGN_VERIFY}.
}}

\item{CustomerMasterKeySpec}{Specifies the type of CMK to create. The \code{CustomerMasterKeySpec}
determines whether the CMK contains a symmetric key or an asymmetric key
pair. It also determines the encryption algorithms or signing algorithms
that the CMK supports. You can\'t change the \code{CustomerMasterKeySpec}
after the CMK is created. To further restrict the algorithms that can be
used with the CMK, use its key policy or IAM policy.

For help with choosing a key spec for your CMK, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html#cmk-key-spec}{Selecting a Customer Master Key Spec}
in the \emph{AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide}.

The default value, \code{SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT}, creates a CMK with a 256-bit
symmetric key.

AWS KMS supports the following key specs for CMKs:
\itemize{
\item Symmetric key (default)
\itemize{
\item \code{SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT} (AES-256-GCM)
}
\item Asymmetric RSA key pairs
\itemize{
\item \code{RSA_2048}
\item \code{RSA_3072}
\item \code{RSA_4096}
}
\item Asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve key pairs
\itemize{
\item \code{ECC_NIST_P256} (secp256r1)
\item \code{ECC_NIST_P384} (secp384r1)
\item \code{ECC_NIST_P521} (secp521r1)
}
\item Other asymmetric elliptic curve key pairs
\itemize{
\item \code{ECC_SECG_P256K1} (secp256k1), commonly used for
cryptocurrencies.
}
}}

\item{Origin}{The source of the key material for the CMK. You cannot change the origin
after you create the CMK. The default is \code{AWS_KMS}, which means AWS KMS
creates the key material.

When the parameter value is \code{EXTERNAL}, AWS KMS creates a CMK without
key material so that you can import key material from your existing key
management infrastructure. For more information about importing key
material into AWS KMS, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html}{Importing Key Material}
in the \emph{AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide}. This value is valid
only for symmetric CMKs.

When the parameter value is \code{AWS_CLOUDHSM}, AWS KMS creates the CMK in
an AWS KMS \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html}{custom key store}
and creates its key material in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. You
must also use the \code{CustomKeyStoreId} parameter to identify the custom
key store. This value is valid only for symmetric CMKs.}

\item{CustomKeyStoreId}{Creates the CMK in the specified \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html}{custom key store}
and the key material in its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. To create a
CMK in a custom key store, you must also specify the \code{Origin} parameter
with a value of \code{AWS_CLOUDHSM}. The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is
associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs,
each in a different Availability Zone in the Region.

This parameter is valid only for symmetric CMKs. You cannot create an
asymmetric CMK in a custom key store.

To find the ID of a custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores
operation.

The response includes the custom key store ID and the ID of the AWS
CloudHSM cluster.

This operation is part of the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html}{Custom Key Store feature}
feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive
integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant
key store.}

\item{BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck}{A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety
check.

Setting this value to true increases the risk that the CMK becomes
unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.

For more information, refer to the scenario in the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam}{Default Key Policy}
section in the \strong{AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide} .

Use this parameter only when you include a policy in the request and you
intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from making a
subsequent PutKeyPolicy request on the CMK.

The default value is false.}

\item{Tags}{One or more tags. Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both
the tag key and the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an
empty (null) string.

When you add tags to an AWS resource, AWS generates a cost allocation
report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. For information about
adding, changing, deleting and listing tags for CMKs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html}{Tagging Keys}.

Use this parameter to tag the CMK when it is created. To add tags to an
existing CMK, use the TagResource operation.}

\description{
Creates a unique customer managed \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master-keys}{customer master key}
(CMK) in your AWS account and Region. You cannot use this operation to
create a CMK in a different AWS account.
}
\details{
You can use the \code{CreateKey} operation to create symmetric or asymmetric
CMKs.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Symmetric CMKs} contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never leaves
AWS KMS unencrypted. To use the CMK, you must call AWS KMS. You can
use a symmetric CMK to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data,
but they are typically used to generate \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys}{data keys}
or data key pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and
GenerateDataKeyPair.
\item \strong{Asymmetric CMKs} can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic Curve
(ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric CMK never leaves
AWS KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the GetPublicKey operation
to download the public key so it can be used outside of AWS KMS.
CMKs with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or
sign and verify messages (but not both). CMKs with ECC key pairs can
be used only to sign and verify messages.
}

For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html}{Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs}
in the \emph{AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide}.

To create different types of CMKs, use the following guidance:
\subsection{Asymmetric CMKs}{

To create an asymmetric CMK, use the \code{CustomerMasterKeySpec} parameter
to specify the type of key material in the CMK. Then, use the \code{KeyUsage}
parameter to determine whether the CMK will be used to encrypt and
decrypt or sign and verify. You can\'t change these properties after the
CMK is created.
}

\subsection{Symmetric CMKs}{

When creating a symmetric CMK, you don\'t need to specify the
\code{CustomerMasterKeySpec} or \code{KeyUsage} parameters. The default value for
\code{CustomerMasterKeySpec}, \code{SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT}, and the default value for
\code{KeyUsage}, \code{ENCRYPT_DECRYPT}, are the only valid values for symmetric
CMKs.
}

\subsection{Imported Key Material}{

To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric CMK with
no key material. To do this, use the \code{Origin} parameter of \code{CreateKey}
with a value of \code{EXTERNAL}. Next, use GetParametersForImport operation
to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt
your key material. Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to
import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html}{Importing Key Material}
in the \strong{AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide} . You cannot
import the key material into an asymmetric CMK.
}

\subsection{Custom Key Stores}{

To create a symmetric CMK in a \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html}{custom key store},
use the \code{CustomKeyStoreId} parameter to specify the custom key store.
You must also use the \code{Origin} parameter with a value of \code{AWS_CLOUDHSM}.
The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store
must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in
the AWS Region.

You cannot create an asymmetric CMK in a custom key store. For
information about custom key stores in AWS KMS see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html}{Using Custom Key Stores}
in the \strong{AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide} .
