\usage{
iam_list_attached_role_policies(RoleName, PathPrefix, Marker, MaxItems)
}
\arguments{
\item{RoleName}{[required] The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the role to list attached policies
for.

This parameter allows (through its \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern}) a string of characters
consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: \\_+=,.@-}

\item{PathPrefix}{The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional.
If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies.

This parameter allows (through its \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern}) a string of characters
consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must
begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any
ASCII character from the ! (\code{U+0021}) through the DEL character
(\verb{U+007F}), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and
lowercased letters.}

\item{Marker}{Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you
receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to
the value of the \code{Marker} element in the response that you received to
indicate where the next call should start.}

\item{MaxItems}{Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of
items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the
maximum you specify, the \code{IsTruncated} response element is \code{true}.

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to
100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more
results available. In that case, the \code{IsTruncated} response element
returns \code{true}, and \code{Marker} contains a value to include in the
subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.}
}
\description{
Lists all managed policies that are attached to the specified IAM role.

An IAM role can also have inline policies embedded with it. To list the
inline policies for a role, use the ListRolePolicies API. For
information about policies, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html}{Managed Policies and Inline Policies}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

You can paginate the results using the \code{MaxItems} and \code{Marker}
parameters. You can use the \code{PathPrefix} parameter to limit the list of
policies to only those matching the specified path prefix. If there are
no policies attached to the specified role (or none that match the
specified path prefix), the operation returns an empty list.
