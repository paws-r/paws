\title{Creates a password for the specified user, giving the user the ability
to access AWS services through the AWS Management Console}
\usage{
iam_create_login_profile(UserName, Password, PasswordResetRequired)
}
\arguments{
\item{UserName}{[required] The name of the IAM user to create a password for. The user must already
exist.

This parameter allows (through its \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern}) a string of characters
consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: \\_+=,.@-}

\item{Password}{[required] The new password for the user.

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} that is used to
validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can
include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (\code{U+0020})
through the end of the ASCII character range (\verb{U+00FF}). You can also
include the tab (\code{U+0009}), line feed (\verb{U+000A}), and carriage return
(\verb{U+000D}) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password.
However, many tools, such as the AWS Management Console, might restrict
the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning
within that tool.}

\item{PasswordResetRequired}{Specifies whether the user is required to set a new password on next
sign-in.}
}
