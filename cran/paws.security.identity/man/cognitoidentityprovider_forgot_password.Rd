\title{Sends a password-reset confirmation code for the currently signed-in
user}
\usage{
cognitoidentityprovider_forgot_password(
  ClientId,
  SecretHash = NULL,
  UserContextData = NULL,
  Username,
  AnalyticsMetadata = NULL,
  ClientMetadata = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ClientId}{[required] The ID of the user pool app client associated with the current signed-in
user.}

\item{SecretHash}{A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in the
message. For more information about \code{SecretHash}, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/signing-up-users-in-your-app.html#cognito-user-pools-computing-secret-hash}{Computing secret hash values}.}

\item{UserContextData}{Contextual data about your user session like the device fingerprint, IP
address, or location. Amazon Cognito threat protection evaluates the
risk of an authentication event based on the context that your app
generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes API requests.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-viewing-threat-protection-app.html}{Collecting data for threat protection in applications}.}

\item{Username}{[required] The name of the user that you want to query or modify. The value of this
parameter is typically your user's username, but it can be any of their
alias attributes. If \code{username} isn't an alias attribute in your user
pool, this value must be the \code{sub} of a local user or the username of a
user from a third-party IdP.}

\item{AnalyticsMetadata}{Information that supports analytics outcomes with Amazon Pinpoint,
including the user's endpoint ID. The endpoint ID is a destination for
Amazon Pinpoint push notifications, for example a device identifier,
email address, or phone number.}

\item{ClientMetadata}{A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any
custom workflows that this action triggers.

You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool
triggers. When you use the ForgotPassword API action, Amazon Cognito
invokes any functions that are assigned to the following triggers: \emph{pre
sign-up}, \emph{custom message}, and \emph{user migration}. When Amazon Cognito
invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON payload, which the
function receives as input. This payload contains a \code{clientMetadata}
attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the
ClientMetadata parameter in your ForgotPassword request. In your
function code in Lambda, you can process the \code{clientMetadata} value to
enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-working-with-lambda-triggers.html}{Using Lambda triggers}
in the \emph{Amazon Cognito Developer Guide}.

When you use the \code{ClientMetadata} parameter, note that Amazon Cognito
won't do the following:
\itemize{
\item Store the \code{ClientMetadata} value. This data is available only to
Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom
workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers,
the \code{ClientMetadata} parameter serves no purpose.
\item Validate the \code{ClientMetadata} value.
\item Encrypt the \code{ClientMetadata} value. Don't send sensitive information
in this parameter.
