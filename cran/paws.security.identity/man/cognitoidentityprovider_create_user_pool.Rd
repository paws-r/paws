}
\arguments{
\item{PoolName}{[required] A string used to name the user pool.}

\item{Policies}{The policies associated with the new user pool.}

\item{DeletionProtection}{When active, \code{DeletionProtection} prevents accidental deletion of your
user pool. Before you can delete a user pool that you have protected
against deletion, you must deactivate this feature.

When you try to delete a protected user pool in a
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_delete_user_pool]{delete_user_pool}} API
request, Amazon Cognito returns an \code{InvalidParameterException} error. To
delete a protected user pool, send a new
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_delete_user_pool]{delete_user_pool}} request
after you deactivate deletion protection in an
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_update_user_pool]{update_user_pool}} API
request.}

\item{LambdaConfig}{The Lambda trigger configuration information for the new user pool.

In a push model, event sources (such as Amazon S3 and custom
applications) need permission to invoke a function. So you must make an
extra call to add permission for these event sources to invoke your
Lambda function.

For more information on using the Lambda API to add permission, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_AddPermission.html}{AddPermission}
.

For adding permission using the CLI, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/add-permission.html}{add-permission}
.}

\item{AutoVerifiedAttributes}{The attributes to be auto-verified. Possible values: \strong{email},
\strong{phone_number}.}

\item{AliasAttributes}{Attributes supported as an alias for this user pool. Possible values:
\strong{phone_number}, \strong{email}, or \strong{preferred_username}.}

\item{UsernameAttributes}{Specifies whether a user can use an email address or phone number as a
username when they sign up.}

\item{SmsVerificationMessage}{This parameter is no longer used. See
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerificationMessageTemplateType.html}{VerificationMessageTemplateType}.}

\item{EmailVerificationMessage}{This parameter is no longer used. See
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerificationMessageTemplateType.html}{VerificationMessageTemplateType}.}

\item{EmailVerificationSubject}{This parameter is no longer used. See
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerificationMessageTemplateType.html}{VerificationMessageTemplateType}.}

\item{VerificationMessageTemplate}{The template for the verification message that the user sees when the
app requests permission to access the user's information.}

\item{SmsAuthenticationMessage}{A string representing the SMS authentication message.}

\item{MfaConfiguration}{Specifies MFA configuration details.}

\item{UserAttributeUpdateSettings}{The settings for updates to user attributes. These settings include the
property \code{AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate}, a user-pool
setting that tells Amazon Cognito how to handle changes to the value of
your users' email address and phone number attributes. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html#user-pool-settings-verifications-verify-attribute-updates}{Verifying updates to email addresses and phone numbers}.}

\item{DeviceConfiguration}{The device-remembering configuration for a user pool. A null value
indicates that you have deactivated device remembering in your user
pool.

When you provide a value for any \code{DeviceConfiguration} field, you
activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature.}

\item{EmailConfiguration}{The email configuration of your user pool. The email configuration type
sets your preferred sending method, Amazon Web Services Region, and
sender for messages from your user pool.}

\item{SmsConfiguration}{The SMS configuration with the settings that your Amazon Cognito user
pool must use to send an SMS message from your Amazon Web Services
account through Amazon Simple Notification Service. To send SMS messages
with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Region that you want, the
Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
role in your Amazon Web Services account.}

\item{UserPoolTags}{The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label
that you can use to categorize and manage user pools in different ways,
such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.}

\item{AdminCreateUserConfig}{The configuration for
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_admin_create_user]{admin_create_user}}
requests.}

\item{Schema}{An array of schema attributes for the new user pool. These attributes
can be standard or custom attributes.}

\item{UserPoolAddOns}{User pool add-ons. Contains settings for activation of advanced security
features. To log user security information but take no action, set to
\code{AUDIT}. To configure automatic security responses to risky traffic to
your user pool, set to \code{ENFORCED}.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-threat-protection.html}{Adding advanced security to a user pool}.}

\item{UsernameConfiguration}{Case sensitivity on the username input for the selected sign-in option.
When case sensitivity is set to \code{False} (case insensitive), users can
sign in with any combination of capital and lowercase letters. For
example, \code{username}, \code{USERNAME}, or \code{UserName}, or for email,
\code{email@example.com} or \code{EMaiL@eXamplE.Com}. For most use cases, set case
sensitivity to \code{False} (case insensitive) as a best practice. When
usernames and email addresses are case insensitive, Amazon Cognito
treats any variation in case as the same user, and prevents a case
variation from being assigned to the same attribute for a different
user.

This configuration is immutable after you set it. For more information,
see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_UsernameConfigurationType.html}{UsernameConfigurationType}.}

\item{AccountRecoverySetting}{The available verified method a user can use to recover their password
when they call
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_forgot_password]{forgot_password}}. You can
use this setting to define a preferred method when a user has more than
one method available. With this setting, SMS doesn't qualify for a valid
password recovery mechanism if the user also has SMS multi-factor
authentication (MFA) activated. In the absence of this setting, Amazon
Cognito uses the legacy behavior to determine the recovery method where
SMS is preferred through email.}

\description{
This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with Amazon Pinpoint. Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.
