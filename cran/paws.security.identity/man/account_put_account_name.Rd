account_put_account_name(AccountId = NULL, AccountName)
}
\arguments{
\item{AccountId}{Specifies the 12 digit account ID number of the Amazon Web Services
account that you want to access or modify with this operation.

If you do not specify this parameter, it defaults to the Amazon Web
Services account of the identity used to call the operation.

To use this parameter, the caller must be an identity in the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#account}{organization's management account}
or a delegated administrator account, and the specified account ID must
be a member account in the same organization. The organization must have
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html}{all features enabled},
and the organization must have \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-account.html}{trusted access}
enabled for the Account Management service, and optionally a \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#delegated-admin}{delegated administrator}
account assigned.

The management account can't specify its own \code{AccountId}; it must call
the operation in standalone context by not including the \code{AccountId}
parameter.

To call this operation on an account that is not a member of an
organization, then don't specify this parameter, and call the operation
using an identity belonging to the account whose contacts you wish to
retrieve or modify.}

\item{AccountName}{[required] The name of the account.}
