value}
\usage{
secretsmanager_update_secret(
  SecretId,
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  Description = NULL,
  KmsKeyId = NULL,
  SecretBinary = NULL,
  SecretString = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SecretId}{[required] The ARN or name of the secret.

For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a
partial ARN. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen}{Finding a secret from a partial ARN}.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{If you include \code{SecretString} or \code{SecretBinary}, then Secrets Manager
creates a new version for the secret, and this parameter specifies the
unique identifier for the new version.

If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services
SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty.
The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the
value for this parameter in the request.

If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service
endpoint, then you must generate a \code{ClientRequestToken} and include it
in the request.

This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to
prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are
failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier}{UUID-type}
value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.}

\item{Description}{The description of the secret.}

\item{KmsKeyId}{The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to
encrypt new secret versions as well as any existing versions with the
staging labels \code{AWSCURRENT}, \code{AWSPENDING}, or \code{AWSPREVIOUS}. If you
don't have \code{kms:Encrypt} permission to the new key, Secrets Manager does
not re-encrypt existing secret versions with the new key. For more
information about versions and staging labels, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/#term_version}{Concepts: Version}.

A key alias is always prefixed by \verb{alias/}, for example
\code{alias/aws/secretsmanager}. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html#alias-about}{About aliases}.

If you set this to an empty string, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web
Services managed key \code{aws/secretsmanager}. If this key doesn't already
exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you
automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account
automatically have access to use \code{aws/secretsmanager}. Creating
\code{aws/secretsmanager} can result in a one-time significant delay in
returning the result.

You can only use the Amazon Web Services managed key
\code{aws/secretsmanager} if you call this operation using credentials from
the same Amazon Web Services account that owns the secret. If the secret
is in a different account, then you must use a customer managed key and
provide the ARN of that KMS key in this field. The user making the call
must have permissions to both the secret and the KMS key in their
respective accounts.}

\item{SecretBinary}{The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.
We recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then pass the
contents of the file as a parameter.

Either \code{SecretBinary} or \code{SecretString} must have a value, but not both.

You can't access this parameter in the Secrets Manager console.

Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service
does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own
log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.}

\item{SecretString}{The text data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. We
recommend you use a JSON structure of key/value pairs for your secret
value.

Either \code{SecretBinary} or \code{SecretString} must have a value, but not both.

Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service
does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own
log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.}
