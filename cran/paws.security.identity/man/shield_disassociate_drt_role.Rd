\description{
Removes the DDoS Response Team's (DRT) access to your AWS account.

To make a \code{\link[=shield_disassociate_drt_role]{disassociate_drt_role}}
request, you must be subscribed to the \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/business/}{Business Support plan} or the
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/enterprise/}{Enterprise Support plan}. However,
if you are not subscribed to one of these support plans, but had been
previously and had granted the DRT access to your account, you can
submit a \code{\link[=shield_disassociate_drt_role]{disassociate_drt_role}} request
to remove this access.
