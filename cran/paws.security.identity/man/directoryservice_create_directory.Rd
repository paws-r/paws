\usage{
directoryservice_create_directory(
  Name,
  ShortName = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The fully qualified name for the directory, such as \code{corp.example.com}.}

\item{ShortName}{The NetBIOS name of the directory, such as \code{CORP}.}

\item{Password}{[required] The password for the directory administrator. The directory creation
process creates a directory administrator account with the user name

If you need to change the password for the administrator account, you
can use the

The regex pattern for this string is made up of the following
conditions:
\itemize{
\item Length (?=^.\{8,64\}$) â€“ Must be between 8 and 64 characters
}

AND any 3 of the following password complexity rules required by Active
Directory:
\itemize{
\item Numbers and upper case and lowercase
(?=.\emph{\\d)(?=.}[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])
\item Numbers and special characters and lower case
(?=.\emph{\\d)(?=.}[^A-Za-z0-9\\s])(?=.*[a-z])
\item Special characters and upper case and lower case
(?=.\emph{[^A-Za-z0-9\\s])(?=.}[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])
\item Numbers and upper case and special characters
(?=.\emph{\\d)(?=.}[A-Z])(?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9\\s])
}
