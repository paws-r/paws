acmpca_create_certificate_authority(
  CertificateAuthorityConfiguration,
  RevocationConfiguration = NULL,
  CertificateAuthorityType,
  IdempotencyToken = NULL,
  KeyStorageSecurityStandard = NULL,
  Tags = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{CertificateAuthorityConfiguration}{[required] Name and bit size of the private key algorithm, the name of the signing
algorithm, and X.500 certificate subject information.}

\item{RevocationConfiguration}{Contains information to enable support for Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP), certificate revocation list (CRL), both protocols, or
neither. By default, both certificate validation mechanisms are
disabled.

The following requirements apply to revocation configurations.
\itemize{
\item A configuration disabling CRLs or OCSP must contain only the
\code{Enabled=False} parameter, and will fail if other parameters such as
\code{CustomCname} or \code{ExpirationInDays} are included.
\item In a CRL configuration, the \code{S3BucketName} parameter must conform to
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html}{Amazon S3 bucket naming rules}.
\item A configuration containing a custom Canonical Name (CNAME) parameter
for CRLs or OCSP must conform to
\href{https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt}{RFC2396} restrictions on the
use of special characters in a CNAME.
\item In a CRL or OCSP configuration, the value of a CNAME parameter must
not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".
}

For more information, see the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_OcspConfiguration.html}{OcspConfiguration}
and
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CrlConfiguration.html}{CrlConfiguration}
types.}

\item{CertificateAuthorityType}{[required] The type of the certificate authority.}

\item{IdempotencyToken}{Custom string that can be used to distinguish between calls to the
\strong{CreateCertificateAuthority} action. Idempotency tokens for
\strong{CreateCertificateAuthority} time out after five minutes. Therefore,
if you call \strong{CreateCertificateAuthority} multiple times with the same
idempotency token within five minutes, Amazon Web Services Private CA
recognizes that you are requesting only certificate authority and will
issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call,
Amazon Web Services Private CA recognizes that you are requesting
multiple certificate authorities.}

\item{KeyStorageSecurityStandard}{Specifies a cryptographic key management compliance standard used for
handling CA keys.

Default: FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_3_OR_HIGHER

Some Amazon Web Services Regions do not support the default. When
creating a CA in these Regions, you must provide
\code{FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_2_OR_HIGHER} as the argument for
\code{KeyStorageSecurityStandard}. Failure to do this results in an
\code{InvalidArgsException} with the message, "A certificate authority cannot
be created in this region with the specified security standard."

For information about security standard support in various Regions, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#private-keys}{Storage and security compliance of Amazon Web Services Private CA private keys}.}

\item{Tags}{Key-value pairs that will be attached to the new private CA. You can
associate up to 50 tags with a private CA. For information using tags
with IAM to manage permissions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_iam-tags.html}{Controlling Access Using IAM Tags}.}

\item{UsageMode}{Specifies whether the CA issues general-purpose certificates that
typically require a revocation mechanism, or short-lived certificates
that may optionally omit revocation because they expire quickly.
Short-lived certificate validity is limited to seven days.

The default value is GENERAL_PURPOSE.}

\description{
Creates a root or subordinate private certificate authority (CA). You must specify the CA configuration, an optional configuration for Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and/or a certificate revocation list (CRL), the CA type, and an optional idempotency token to avoid accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The OCSP configuration can optionally specify a custom URL for the OCSP responder. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA.
