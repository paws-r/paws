\usage{
wafv2_get_rate_based_statement_managed_keys(
  Scope,
  WebACLName,
  WebACLId,
  RuleGroupRuleName = NULL,
  RuleName
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Scope}{[required] Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon
CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use \code{CLOUDFRONT}.

To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N.
Virginia) as follows:
\itemize{
\item CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope:
\code{--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1}.
\item API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
}}

\item{WebACLName}{[required] The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL after
you create it.}

\item{WebACLId}{[required] The unique identifier for the web ACL. This ID is returned in the
responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like
update and delete.}

\item{RuleGroupRuleName}{The name of the rule group reference statement in your web ACL. This is
required only when you have the rate-based rule nested inside a rule
group.}

\item{RuleName}{[required] The name of the rate-based rule to get the keys for. If you have the
rule defined inside a rule group that you're using in your web ACL, also
provide the name of the rule group reference statement in the request
parameter \code{RuleGroupRuleName}.}
