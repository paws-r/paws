\title{Lists the versions of a secret}
\usage{
secretsmanager_list_secret_version_ids(
  SecretId,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL,
  IncludeDeprecated = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SecretId}{[required] The ARN or name of the secret whose versions you want to list.

For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a
partial ARN. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen}{Finding a secret from a partial ARN}.}

\item{MaxResults}{The number of results to include in the response.

If there are more results available, in the response, Secrets Manager
includes \code{NextToken}. To get the next results, call
\code{\link[=secretsmanager_list_secret_version_ids]{list_secret_version_ids}}
again with the value from \code{NextToken}.}

\item{NextToken}{A token that indicates where the output should continue from, if a
previous call did not show all results. To get the next results, call
\code{\link[=secretsmanager_list_secret_version_ids]{list_secret_version_ids}}
again with this value.}

\item{IncludeDeprecated}{Specifies whether to include versions of secrets that don't have any
staging labels attached to them. Versions without staging labels are
considered deprecated and are subject to deletion by Secrets Manager.}
}
\description{
Lists the versions of a secret. Secrets Manager uses staging labels to indicate the different versions of a secret. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#term_version}{Secrets Manager concepts: Versions}.
