Manager (ACM) service principal (acm}
\usage{
acmpca_delete_permission(CertificateAuthorityArn, Principal,
  SourceAccount)
}
\arguments{
\item{CertificateAuthorityArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA that issued the
permissions. You can find the CA's ARN by calling the
\code{\link[=acmpca_list_certificate_authorities]{list_certificate_authorities}}
action. This must have the following form:

\code{arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 }.}

\item{Principal}{[required] The AWS service or identity that will have its CA permissions revoked.
At this time, the only valid service principal is \code{acm.amazonaws.com}}

\item{SourceAccount}{The AWS account that calls this action.}
}
\value{
An empty list.

\description{
Revokes permissions on a private CA granted to the AWS Certificate
Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).

These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew ACM certificates that
reside in the same AWS account as the CA. If you revoke these
permissions, ACM will no longer renew the affected certificates
automatically.

Permissions can be granted with the
\code{\link[=acmpca_create_permission]{create_permission}} action and listed with
the \code{\link[=acmpca_list_permissions]{list_permissions}} action.

\strong{About Permissions}
\itemize{
\item If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same
account, you can use \code{\link[=acmpca_create_permission]{create_permission}}
to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate
renewals.
\item For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service
principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list
certificates.
\item If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different
accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic
renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a
resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html}{Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA}.
