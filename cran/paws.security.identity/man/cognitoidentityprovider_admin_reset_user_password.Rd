\title{Resets the specified user's password in a user pool as an administrator}
\usage{
cognitoidentityprovider_admin_reset_user_password(
  UserPoolId,
  Username,
  ClientMetadata = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{UserPoolId}{[required] The user pool ID for the user pool where you want to reset the user's
password.}

\item{Username}{[required] The user name of the user whose password you want to reset.}

\item{ClientMetadata}{A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any
custom workflows that this action triggers.

You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool
triggers. When you use the AdminResetUserPassword API action, Amazon
Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the \emph{custom message}
trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON
payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a
\code{clientMetadata} attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to
the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminResetUserPassword request. In
your function code in Lambda, you can process the \code{clientMetadata} value
to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html}{Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers}
in the \emph{Amazon Cognito Developer Guide}.

When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito
won't do the following:
\itemize{
\item Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom
workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers,
the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.
\item Validate the ClientMetadata value.
\item Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
provide sensitive information.
