\title{Deletes a secret and all of its versions}
\usage{
secretsmanager_delete_secret(
  SecretId,
  RecoveryWindowInDays = NULL,
  ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SecretId}{[required] The ARN or name of the secret to delete.

For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a
partial ARN. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen}{Finding a secret from a partial ARN}.}

\item{RecoveryWindowInDays}{The number of days from 7 to 30 that Secrets Manager waits before
permanently deleting the secret. You can't use both this parameter and
\code{ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery} in the same call. If you don't use either,
then Secrets Manager defaults to a 30 day recovery window.}

\item{ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery}{Specifies whether to delete the secret without any recovery window. You
can't use both this parameter and \code{RecoveryWindowInDays} in the same
call. If you don't use either, then Secrets Manager defaults to a 30 day
recovery window.

Secrets Manager performs the actual deletion with an asynchronous
background process, so there might be a short delay before the secret is
permanently deleted. If you delete a secret and then immediately create
a secret with the same name, use appropriate back off and retry logic.

Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to
skip the normal recovery window before the permanent deletion that
Secrets Manager would normally impose with the \code{RecoveryWindowInDays}
parameter. If you delete a secret with the \code{ForceDeleteWithouRecovery}
parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. You lose
the secret permanently.}
}
\description{
Deletes a secret and all of its versions. You can specify a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. The minimum recovery window is 7 days. The default recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a \code{DeletionDate} stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.
