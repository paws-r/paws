\description{
Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security
state of your AWS environment and resources. It also provides you with
the readiness status of your environment based on controls from
supported security standards. Security Hub collects security data from
AWS accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps
you analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest
priority security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see
the \emph{\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html}{AWS Security Hub User Guide}}
.

When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are
executed only in the AWS Region that is currently active or in the
specific AWS Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration
or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to
that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same
command for each Region to apply the change to.

For example, if your Region is set to \code{us-west-2}, when you use
\code{\link[=securityhub_create_members]{create_members}} to add a member account
to Security Hub, the association of the member account with the master
account is created only in the \code{us-west-2} Region. Security Hub must be
enabled for the member account in the same Region that the invitation
was sent from.

The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API
operations.
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=securityhub_batch_enable_standards]{batch_enable_standards}} -
\code{RateLimit} of 1 request per second, \code{BurstLimit} of 1 request per
second.
\item \code{\link[=securityhub_get_findings]{get_findings}} - \code{RateLimit} of 3
requests per second. \code{BurstLimit} of 6 requests per second.
\item \code{\link[=securityhub_update_findings]{update_findings}} - \code{RateLimit} of 1
request per second. \code{BurstLimit} of 5 requests per second.
\item \code{\link[=securityhub_update_standards_control]{update_standards_control}} -
\code{RateLimit} of 1 request per second, \code{BurstLimit} of 5 requests per
second.
\item All other operations - \code{RateLimit} of 10 requests per second.
\code{BurstLimit} of 30 requests per second.
