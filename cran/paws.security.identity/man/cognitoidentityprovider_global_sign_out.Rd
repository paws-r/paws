\description{
Signs out users from all devices. It also invalidates all refresh tokens that Amazon Cognito has issued to a user. The user's current access and ID tokens remain valid until their expiry. By default, access and ID tokens expire one hour after Amazon Cognito issues them. A user can still use a hosted UI cookie to retrieve new tokens for the duration of the cookie validity period of 1 hour.
