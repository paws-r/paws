\title{Deletes the specified RuleGroup}
\usage{
wafv2_delete_rule_group(Name, Scope, Id, LockToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name of the rule group. You cannot change the name of a rule group
after you create it.}

\item{Scope}{[required] Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or for a
regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load
Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API,
or an Amazon Cognito user pool.

To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N.
Virginia) as follows:
\itemize{
\item CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope:
\code{--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1}.
\item API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
}}

\item{Id}{[required] A unique identifier for the rule group. This ID is returned in the
responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like
update and delete.}

\item{LockToken}{[required] A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your \code{get}
and \code{list} requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the
request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you
provide the token to operations like \code{update} and \code{delete}. WAF uses the
token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you
last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a
\code{WAFOptimisticLockException}. If this happens, perform another \code{get},
and use the new token returned by that operation.}
