\title{Retrieves information about all IAM users, groups, roles, and policies
in your Amazon Web Services account, including their relationships to
one another}
\usage{
iam_get_account_authorization_details(
  Filter = NULL,
  MaxItems = NULL,
  Marker = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Filter}{A list of entity types used to filter the results. Only the entities
that match the types you specify are included in the output. Use the
value \code{LocalManagedPolicy} to include customer managed policies.

The format for this parameter is a comma-separated (if more than one)
list of strings. Each string value in the list must be one of the valid
values listed below.}

\item{MaxItems}{Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of
items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the
maximum you specify, the \code{IsTruncated} response element is \code{true}.

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to
100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more
results available. In that case, the \code{IsTruncated} response element
returns \code{true}, and \code{Marker} contains a value to include in the
subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.}

\item{Marker}{Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you
receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to
the value of the \code{Marker} element in the response that you received to
indicate where the next call should start.}
}
