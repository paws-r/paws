\description{
Deletes the password for the specified IAM user, which terminates the
user's ability to access AWS services through the AWS Management
Console.

Deleting a user's password does not prevent a user from accessing AWS
through the command line interface or the API. To prevent all user
access, you must also either make any access keys inactive or delete
them. For more information about making keys inactive or deleting them,
see \code{\link[=iam_update_access_key]{update_access_key}} and
\code{\link[=iam_delete_access_key]{delete_access_key}}.
