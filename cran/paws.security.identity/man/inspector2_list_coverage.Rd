\usage{
inspector2_list_coverage(
  filterCriteria = NULL,
  maxResults = NULL,
  nextToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filterCriteria}{An object that contains details on the filters to apply to the coverage
data for your environment.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of results the response can return. If your request
would return more than the maximum the response will return a
\code{nextToken} value, use this value when you call the action again to get
the remaining results.}

\item{nextToken}{A token to use for paginating results that are returned in the response.
Set the value of this parameter to null for the first request to a list
action. If your response returns more than the \code{maxResults} maximum
value it will also return a \code{nextToken} value. For subsequent calls, use
the \code{nextToken} value returned from the previous request to continue
listing results after the first page.}
