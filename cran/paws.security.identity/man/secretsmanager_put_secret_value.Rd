\title{Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it
to the secret}
\usage{
secretsmanager_put_secret_value(
  SecretId,
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  SecretBinary = NULL,
  SecretString = NULL,
  VersionStages = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SecretId}{[required] The ARN or name of the secret to add a new version to.

For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a
partial ARN. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen}{Finding a secret from a partial ARN}.

If the secret doesn't already exist, use
\code{\link[=secretsmanager_create_secret]{create_secret}} instead.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{A unique identifier for the new version of the secret.

If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services
SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty
because they generate a random UUID for you. If you don't use the SDK
and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service
endpoint, then you must generate a \code{ClientRequestToken} yourself for new
versions and include that value in the request.

This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to
prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are
failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function processing. We
recommend that you generate a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier}{UUID-type}
value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.
\itemize{
\item If the \code{ClientRequestToken} value isn't already associated with a
version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.
\item If a version with this value already exists and that version's
\code{SecretString} or \code{SecretBinary} values are the same as those in the
request then the request is ignored. The operation is idempotent.
\item If a version with this value already exists and the version of the
\code{SecretString} and \code{SecretBinary} values are different from those in
the request, then the request fails because you can't modify a
secret version. You can only create new versions to store new secret
values.
}

This value becomes the \code{VersionId} of the new version.}

\item{SecretBinary}{The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.
To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you
store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents of the file
as a parameter.

You must include \code{SecretBinary} or \code{SecretString}, but not both.

You can't access this value from the Secrets Manager console.}

\item{SecretString}{The text to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.

You must include \code{SecretBinary} or \code{SecretString}, but not both.

We recommend you create the secret string as JSON key/value pairs, as
shown in the example.}

\item{VersionStages}{A list of staging labels to attach to this version of the secret.
Secrets Manager uses staging labels to track versions of a secret
through the rotation process.

If you specify a staging label that's already associated with a
different version of the same secret, then Secrets Manager removes the
label from the other version and attaches it to this version. If you
specify \code{AWSCURRENT}, and it is already attached to another version,
then Secrets Manager also moves the staging label \code{AWSPREVIOUS} to the
version that \code{AWSCURRENT} was removed from.

If you don't include \code{VersionStages}, then Secrets Manager automatically
moves the staging label \code{AWSCURRENT} to this version.}
}

Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it to the secret. The version can contain a new \code{SecretString} value or a new \code{SecretBinary} value.
