\usage{
securityhub_batch_update_findings(FindingIdentifiers, Note, Severity,
  VerificationState, Confidence, Criticality, Types, UserDefinedFields,
  Workflow, RelatedFindings)
}
\arguments{
\item{FindingIdentifiers}{[required] The list of findings to update.
\code{\link[=securityhub_batch_update_findings]{batch_update_findings}} can be used
to update up to 100 findings at a time.

For each finding, the list provides the finding identifier and the ARN
of the finding provider.}

\item{Note}{}

\item{Severity}{Used to update the finding severity.}

\item{VerificationState}{Indicates the veracity of a finding.

The available values for \code{VerificationState} are as follows.
\itemize{
\item \code{UNKNOWN} – The default disposition of a security finding
\item \code{TRUE_POSITIVE} – The security finding is confirmed
\item \code{FALSE_POSITIVE} – The security finding was determined to be a false
alarm
\item \code{BENIGN_POSITIVE} – A special case of \code{TRUE_POSITIVE} where the
finding doesn't pose any threat, is expected, or both
}}

\item{Confidence}{The updated value for the finding confidence. Confidence is defined as
the likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or
issue that it was intended to identify.

Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0 means
zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confidence.}

\item{Criticality}{The updated value for the level of importance assigned to the resources
associated with the findings.

A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criticality,
and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.}

\item{Types}{One or more finding types in the format of namespace/category/classifier
that classify a finding.

Valid namespace values are as follows.
\itemize{
\item Software and Configuration Checks
\item TTPs
\item Effects
\item Unusual Behaviors
\item Sensitive Data Identifications
}}

\item{UserDefinedFields}{A list of name/value string pairs associated with the finding. These are
custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.}

\item{Workflow}{Used to update the workflow status of a finding.

The workflow status indicates the progress of the investigation into the
finding.}

\item{RelatedFindings}{A list of findings that are related to the updated findings.}
}
\value{
A list with the following syntax:\preformatted{list(
  ProcessedFindings = list(
    list(
      Id = "string",
      ProductArn = "string"
    )
  ),
  UnprocessedFindings = list(
    list(
      FindingIdentifier = list(
        Id = "string",
        ProductArn = "string"
      ),
      ErrorCode = "string",
      ErrorMessage = "string"
    )
  )
)
}
}
\description{
Used by Security Hub customers to update information about their
investigation into a finding. Requested by master accounts or member
accounts. Master accounts can update findings for their account and
their member accounts. Member accounts can update findings for their
account.

Updates from
\code{\link[=securityhub_batch_update_findings]{batch_update_findings}} do not
affect the value of \code{UpdatedAt} for a finding.

Master and member accounts can use
\code{\link[=securityhub_batch_update_findings]{batch_update_findings}} to update
the following finding fields and objects.
\itemize{
\item \code{Confidence}
\item \code{Criticality}
\item \code{Note}
\item \code{RelatedFindings}
\item \code{Severity}
\item \code{Types}
\item \code{UserDefinedFields}
\item \code{VerificationState}
\item \code{Workflow}
}

You can configure IAM policies to restrict access to fields and field
values. For example, you might not want member accounts to be able to
suppress findings or change the finding severity. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/finding-update-batchupdatefindings.html#batchupdatefindings-configure-access}{Configuring access to BatchUpdateFindings}
in the \emph{AWS Security Hub User Guide}.
