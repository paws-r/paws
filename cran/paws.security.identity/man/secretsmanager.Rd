AWS Secrets Manager API Reference

AWS Secrets Manager provides a service to enable you to store, manage,
and retrieve, secrets.

This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more
information about using this service, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/}{AWS Secrets Manager User Guide}.

\strong{API Version}

This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets
Manager API version 2017-10-17.

As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs,
which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android. The
SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS
Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs provide cryptographically signing
requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more
information about the AWS SDKs, including downloading and installing
them, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/tools/}{Tools for Amazon Web Services}.

We recommend you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to
Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP
Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To
learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html}{Making Query Requests}
in the \emph{AWS Secrets Manager User Guide}.

Secrets Manager API supports GET and POST requests for all actions, and
doesn't require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others.
However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL.
Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.

\strong{Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager}

We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to
\href{mailto:awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com}{awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com}, or post your feedback and
questions in the \href{https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296}{AWS Secrets Manager Discussion Forum}. For more
information about the AWS Discussion Forums, see \href{https://forums.aws.amazon.com:443/help.jspa}{Forums Help}.

\strong{How examples are presented}

The JSON that AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and
the service returns as a response to HTTP query requests contain single,
long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON
shown in the examples displays the code formatted with both line breaks
and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters
can also cause long strings extending beyond the screen, you can insert
line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input
as a single JSON text string.

\strong{Logging API Requests}

AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS
API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
bucket. By using information that's collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can
determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made
the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets
Manager and support for AWS CloudTrail, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail}{Logging AWS Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail}
in the \emph{AWS Secrets Manager User Guide}. To learn more about CloudTrail,
including enabling it and find your log files, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html}{AWS CloudTrail User Guide}.
