Retrieves a certificate from your private CA or one that has been shared with you. The ARN of the certificate is returned when you call the \code{\link[=acmpca_issue_certificate]{issue_certificate}} action. You must specify both the ARN of your private CA and the ARN of the issued certificate when calling the \strong{GetCertificate} action. You can retrieve the certificate if it is in the \strong{ISSUED} state. You can call the \code{\link[=acmpca_create_certificate_authority_audit_report]{create_certificate_authority_audit_report}} action to create a report that contains information about all of the certificates issued and revoked by your private CA.
