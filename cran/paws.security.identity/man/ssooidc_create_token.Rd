ssooidc_create_token(
  clientId,
  clientSecret,
  grantType,
  deviceCode,
  code = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{clientId}{[required] The unique identifier string for each client. This value should come
from the persisted result of the
\code{\link[=ssooidc_register_client]{register_client}} API.}

\item{clientSecret}{[required] A secret string generated for the client. This value should come from
the persisted result of the \code{\link[=ssooidc_register_client]{register_client}}
API.}

\item{grantType}{[required] Supports grant types for the authorization code, refresh token, and
device code request. For device code requests, specify the following
value:

\code{urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code }

For information about how to obtain the device code, see the
\code{\link[=ssooidc_start_device_authorization]{start_device_authorization}}
topic.}

\item{deviceCode}{[required] Used only when calling this API for the device code grant type. This
short-term code is used to identify this authentication attempt. This
should come from an in-memory reference to the result of the
\code{\link[=ssooidc_start_device_authorization]{start_device_authorization}} API.}

\item{code}{The authorization code received from the authorization service. This
parameter is required to perform an authorization grant request to get
access to a token.}

\item{refreshToken}{Currently, \code{refreshToken} is not yet implemented and is not supported.

The token used to obtain an access token in the event that the access
token is invalid or expired.}

\item{scope}{The list of scopes that is defined by the client. Upon authorization,
this list is used to restrict permissions when granting an access token.}
