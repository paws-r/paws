\title{Attaches a resource-based permission policy to a secret}
\usage{
secretsmanager_put_resource_policy(
  SecretId,
  ResourcePolicy,
  BlockPublicPolicy = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SecretId}{[required] The ARN or name of the secret to attach the resource-based policy.

For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a
partial ARN. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen}{Finding a secret from a partial ARN}.}

\item{ResourcePolicy}{[required] A JSON-formatted string for an Amazon Web Services resource-based
policy. For example policies, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_iam-policies.html}{Permissions policy examples}.}

\item{BlockPublicPolicy}{Specifies whether to block resource-based policies that allow broad
access to the secret, for example those that use a wildcard for the
principal. By default, public policies aren't blocked.

Resource policy validation and the BlockPublicPolicy parameter help
protect your resources by preventing public access from being granted
through the resource policies that are directly attached to your
secrets. In addition to using these features, carefully inspect the
following policies to confirm that they do not grant public access:
\itemize{
\item Identity-based policies attached to associated Amazon Web Services
principals (for example, IAM roles)
\item Resource-based policies attached to associated Amazon Web Services
resources (for example, Key Management Service (KMS) keys)
}

To review permissions to your secrets, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/determine-acccess_examine-iam-policies.html}{Determine who has permissions to your secrets}.}
