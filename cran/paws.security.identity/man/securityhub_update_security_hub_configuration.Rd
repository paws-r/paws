\title{Updates configuration options for Security Hub}
\usage{
securityhub_update_security_hub_configuration(
  AutoEnableControls = NULL,
  ControlFindingGenerator = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{AutoEnableControls}{Whether to automatically enable new controls when they are added to
standards that are enabled.

By default, this is set to \code{true}, and new controls are enabled
automatically. To not automatically enable new controls, set this to
\code{false}.

When you automatically enable new controls, you can interact with the
controls in the console and programmatically immediately after release.
However, automatically enabled controls have a temporary default status
of \code{DISABLED}. It can take up to several days for Security Hub to
process the control release and designate the control as \code{ENABLED} in
your account. During the processing period, you can manually enable or
disable a control, and Security Hub will maintain that designation
regardless of whether you have \code{AutoEnableControls} set to \code{true}.}

\item{ControlFindingGenerator}{Updates whether the calling account has consolidated control findings
turned on. If the value for this field is set to \code{SECURITY_CONTROL},
Security Hub generates a single finding for a control check even when
the check applies to multiple enabled standards.

If the value for this field is set to \code{STANDARD_CONTROL}, Security Hub
generates separate findings for a control check when the check applies
to multiple enabled standards.

For accounts that are part of an organization, this value can only be
updated in the administrator account.}
