\title{Resends the confirmation (for confirmation of registration) to a
specific user in the user pool}
\usage{
cognitoidentityprovider_resend_confirmation_code(
  ClientId,
  SecretHash = NULL,
  UserContextData = NULL,
  Username,
  AnalyticsMetadata = NULL,
  ClientMetadata = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ClientId}{[required] The ID of the client associated with the user pool.}

\item{SecretHash}{A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in the
message.}

\item{UserContextData}{Contextual data about your user session, such as the device fingerprint,
IP address, or location. Amazon Cognito advanced security evaluates the
risk of an authentication event based on the context that your app
generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes API requests.}

\item{Username}{[required] The \code{username} attribute of the user to whom you want to resend a
confirmation code.}

\item{AnalyticsMetadata}{The Amazon Pinpoint analytics metadata that contributes to your metrics
for
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_resend_confirmation_code]{resend_confirmation_code}}
calls.}

\item{ClientMetadata}{A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any
custom workflows that this action triggers.

You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool
triggers. When you use the ResendConfirmationCode API action, Amazon
Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the \emph{custom message}
trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON
payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a
\code{clientMetadata} attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to
the ClientMetadata parameter in your ResendConfirmationCode request. In
your function code in Lambda, you can process the \code{clientMetadata} value
to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html}{Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers}
in the \emph{Amazon Cognito Developer Guide}.

When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito
won't do the following:
\itemize{
\item Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to
Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom
workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers,
the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.
\item Validate the ClientMetadata value.
\item Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to
provide sensitive information.
