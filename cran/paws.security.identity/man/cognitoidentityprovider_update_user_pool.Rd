}
\arguments{
\item{UserPoolId}{[required] The user pool ID for the user pool you want to update.}

\item{Policies}{A container with the policies you want to update in a user pool.}

\item{LambdaConfig}{The Lambda configuration information from the request to update the user
pool.}

\item{AutoVerifiedAttributes}{The attributes that are automatically verified when Amazon Cognito
requests to update user pools.}

\item{SmsVerificationMessage}{A container with information about the SMS verification message.}

\item{EmailVerificationMessage}{The contents of the email verification message.}

\item{EmailVerificationSubject}{The subject of the email verification message.}

\item{VerificationMessageTemplate}{The template for verification messages.}

\item{SmsAuthenticationMessage}{The contents of the SMS authentication message.}

\item{UserAttributeUpdateSettings}{The settings for updates to user attributes. These settings include the
property \code{AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate}, a user-pool
setting that tells Amazon Cognito how to handle changes to the value of
your users' email address and phone number attributes. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html#user-pool-settings-verifications-verify-attribute-updates}{Verifying updates to email addresses and phone numbers}.}

\item{MfaConfiguration}{Possible values include:
\itemize{
\item \code{OFF} - MFA tokens aren't required and can't be specified during
user registration.
\item \code{ON} - MFA tokens are required for all user registrations. You can
only specify ON when you're initially creating a user pool. You can
use the
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_set_user_pool_mfa_config]{set_user_pool_mfa_config}}
API operation to turn MFA "ON" for existing user pools.
\item \code{OPTIONAL} - Users have the option when registering to create an MFA
token.
}}

\item{DeviceConfiguration}{The device-remembering configuration for a user pool. A null value
indicates that you have deactivated device remembering in your user
pool.

When you provide a value for any \code{DeviceConfiguration} field, you
activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature.}

\item{EmailConfiguration}{The email configuration of your user pool. The email configuration type
sets your preferred sending method, Amazon Web Services Region, and
sender for email invitation and verification messages from your user
pool.}

\item{SmsConfiguration}{The SMS configuration with the settings that your Amazon Cognito user
pool must use to send an SMS message from your Amazon Web Services
account through Amazon Simple Notification Service. To send SMS messages
with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Region that you want, the
Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
role in your Amazon Web Services account.}

\item{UserPoolTags}{The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label
that you can use to categorize and manage user pools in different ways,
such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.}

\item{AdminCreateUserConfig}{The configuration for
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_admin_create_user]{admin_create_user}}
requests.}

\item{UserPoolAddOns}{Enables advanced security risk detection. Set the key
\code{AdvancedSecurityMode} to the value "AUDIT".}

\item{AccountRecoverySetting}{The available verified method a user can use to recover their password
when they call
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_forgot_password]{forgot_password}}. You can
use this setting to define a preferred method when a user has more than
one method available. With this setting, SMS doesn't qualify for a valid
password recovery mechanism if the user also has SMS multi-factor
authentication (MFA) activated. In the absence of this setting, Amazon
Cognito uses the legacy behavior to determine the recovery method where
SMS is preferred through email.}
}
\description{
Updates the specified user pool with the specified attributes. You can get a list of the current user pool settings using \code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_describe_user_pool]{describe_user_pool}}. If you don't provide a value for an attribute, it will be set to the default value.
