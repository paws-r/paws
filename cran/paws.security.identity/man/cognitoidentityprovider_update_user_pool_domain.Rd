\title{A user pool domain hosts managed login, an authorization server and web
server for authentication in your application}
\usage{
cognitoidentityprovider_update_user_pool_domain(
  Domain,
  UserPoolId,
  ManagedLoginVersion = NULL,
  CustomDomainConfig = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Domain}{[required] The name of the domain that you want to update. For custom domains, this
is the fully-qualified domain name, for example \code{auth.example.com}. For
prefix domains, this is the prefix alone, such as \code{myprefix}.}

\item{UserPoolId}{[required] The ID of the user pool that is associated with the domain you're
updating.}

\item{ManagedLoginVersion}{A version number that indicates the state of managed login for your
domain. Version \code{1} is hosted UI (classic). Version \code{2} is the newer
managed login with the branding designer. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html}{Managed login}.}

\item{CustomDomainConfig}{The configuration for a custom domain that hosts managed login for your
application. In an
\code{\link[=cognitoidentityprovider_update_user_pool_domain]{update_user_pool_domain}}
request, this parameter specifies an SSL certificate for the managed
login hosted webserver. The certificate must be an ACM ARN in
\code{us-east-1}.

When you create a custom domain, the passkey RP ID defaults to the
custom domain. If you had a prefix domain active, this will cause
passkey integration for your prefix domain to stop working due to a
mismatch in RP ID. To keep the prefix domain passkey integration
working, you can explicitly set RP ID to the prefix domain.}

\description{
A user pool domain hosts managed login, an authorization server and web server for authentication in your application. This operation updates the branding version for user pool domains between \code{1} for hosted UI (classic) and \code{2} for managed login. It also updates the SSL certificate for user pool custom domains.
