\description{
Describes available AWS services in a prefix list format, which includes
the prefix list name and prefix list ID of the service and the IP
address range for the service. A prefix list ID is required for creating
an outbound security group rule that allows traffic from a VPC to access
an AWS service through a gateway VPC endpoint. Currently, the services
that support this action are Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.
