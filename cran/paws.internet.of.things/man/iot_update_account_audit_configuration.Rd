\usage{
iot_update_account_audit_configuration(roleArn,
  auditNotificationTargetConfigurations, auditCheckConfigurations)
}
\arguments{
\item{roleArn}{The ARN of the role that grants permission to AWS IoT to access
information about your devices, policies, certificates and other items
as required when performing an audit.}

\item{auditNotificationTargetConfigurations}{Information about the targets to which audit notifications are sent.}

\item{auditCheckConfigurations}{Specifies which audit checks are enabled and disabled for this account.
Use \code{DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration} to see the list of all checks,
including those that are currently enabled.

Some data collection might start immediately when certain checks are
enabled. When a check is disabled, any data collected so far in relation
to the check is deleted.

You cannot disable a check if it is used by any scheduled audit. You
must first delete the check from the scheduled audit or delete the
scheduled audit itself.

On the first call to \code{UpdateAccountAuditConfiguration}, this parameter
is required and must specify at least one enabled check.}
