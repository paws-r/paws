\usage{
iotjobsdataplane_update_job_execution(jobId, thingName, status,
  statusDetails, stepTimeoutInMinutes, expectedVersion,
  includeJobExecutionState, includeJobDocument, executionNumber)
}
\arguments{
\item{jobId}{[required] The unique identifier assigned to this job when it was created.}

\item{thingName}{[required] The name of the thing associated with the device.}

\item{status}{[required] The new status for the job execution (IN\\_PROGRESS, FAILED, SUCCESS, or
REJECTED). This must be specified on every update.}

\item{statusDetails}{Optional. A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of
the job execution. If not specified, the statusDetails are unchanged.}

\item{stepTimeoutInMinutes}{Specifies the amount of time this device has to finish execution of this
job. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state before
this timer expires, or before the timer is reset (by again calling
\code{UpdateJobExecution}, setting the status to \code{IN_PROGRESS} and specifying
a new timeout value in this field) the job execution status will be
automatically set to \code{TIMED_OUT}. Note that setting or resetting this
timeout has no effect on that job execution timeout which may have been
specified when the job was created (\code{CreateJob} using field
\code{timeoutConfig}).}

\item{expectedVersion}{Optional. The expected current version of the job execution. Each time
you update the job execution, its version is incremented. If the version
of the job execution stored in Jobs does not match, the update is
rejected with a VersionMismatch error, and an ErrorResponse that
contains the current job execution status data is returned. (This makes
it unnecessary to perform a separate DescribeJobExecution request in
order to obtain the job execution status data.)}

\item{includeJobExecutionState}{Optional. When included and set to true, the response contains the
JobExecutionState data. The default is false.}

\item{includeJobDocument}{Optional. When set to true, the response contains the job document. The
default is false.}

\item{executionNumber}{Optional. A number that identifies a particular job execution on a
particular device.}
