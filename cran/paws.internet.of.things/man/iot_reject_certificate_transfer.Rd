Rejects a pending certificate transfer. After AWS IoT rejects a
certificate transfer, the certificate status changes from
\strong{PENDING\\_TRANSFER} to \strong{INACTIVE}.
}

To check for pending certificate transfers, call ListCertificates to
enumerate your certificates.

This operation can only be called by the transfer destination. After it
is called, the certificate will be returned to the source\'s account in
the INACTIVE state.
