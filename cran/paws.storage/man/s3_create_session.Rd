\title{Creates a session that establishes temporary security credentials to
support fast authentication and authorization for the Zonal endpoint API
operations on directory buckets}
\usage{
s3_create_session(
  SessionMode = NULL,
  Bucket,
  ServerSideEncryption = NULL,
  SSEKMSKeyId = NULL,
  SSEKMSEncryptionContext = NULL,
  BucketKeyEnabled = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SessionMode}{Specifies the mode of the session that will be created, either
\code{ReadWrite} or \code{ReadOnly}. By default, a \code{ReadWrite} session is created.
A \code{ReadWrite} session is capable of executing all the Zonal endpoint API
operations on a directory bucket. A \code{ReadOnly} session is constrained to
execute the following Zonal endpoint API operations:
\code{\link[=s3_get_object]{get_object}}, \code{\link[=s3_head_object]{head_object}},
\code{\link[=s3_list_objects_v2]{list_objects_v2}},
\code{\link[=s3_get_object_attributes]{get_object_attributes}},
\code{\link[=s3_list_parts]{list_parts}}, and
\code{\link[=s3_list_multipart_uploads]{list_multipart_uploads}}.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket that you create a session for.}

\item{ServerSideEncryption}{The server-side encryption algorithm to use when you store objects in
the directory bucket.

For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for
server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed
keys (SSE-S3) (\code{AES256}) and server-side encryption with KMS keys
(SSE-KMS) (\code{aws:kms}). By default, Amazon S3 encrypts data with SSE-S3.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/}{Protecting data with server-side encryption} in
the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{SSEKMSKeyId}{If you specify \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption} with \code{aws:kms}, you must
specify the \code{ x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id} header with
the ID (Key ID or Key ARN) of the KMS symmetric encryption customer
managed key to use. Otherwise, you get an HTTP \verb{400 Bad Request} error.
Only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key
isn't supported. Also, if the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account
that't issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key
ID.

Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk}{customer managed key}
per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. The \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk}{Amazon Web Services managed key}
(\code{aws/s3}) isn't supported.}

\item{SSEKMSEncryptionContext}{Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an
additional encryption context to use for object encryption. The value of
this header is a Base64 encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON, which
contains the encryption context as key-value pairs. This value is stored
as object metadata and automatically gets passed on to Amazon Web
Services KMS for future \code{\link[=s3_get_object]{get_object}} operations on this
object.

\strong{General purpose buckets} - This value must be explicitly added during
\code{\link[=s3_copy_object]{copy_object}} operations if you want an additional
encryption context for your object. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html#encryption-context}{Encryption context}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

\strong{Directory buckets} - You can optionally provide an explicit
encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption
context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional
encryption context value is not supported.}

\item{BucketKeyEnabled}{Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
encryption with server-side encryption using KMS keys (SSE-KMS).

S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for \code{GET} and \code{PUT} operations in a
directory bucket and canâ€™t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported,
when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to
directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or
between directory buckets, through \code{\link[=s3_copy_object]{copy_object}},
\code{\link[=s3_upload_part_copy]{upload_part_copy}}, \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-Batch-Ops.html}{the Copy operation in Batch Operations},
or \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-import-job.html}{the import jobs}.
In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is
made for a KMS-encrypted object.}
