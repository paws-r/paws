\title{Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an
existing lifecycle configuration}
\usage{
s3_put_bucket_lifecycle_configuration(
  Bucket,
  ChecksumAlgorithm = NULL,
  LifecycleConfiguration = NULL,
  ExpectedBucketOwner = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket for which to set the configuration.}

\item{ChecksumAlgorithm}{Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when
using the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality
if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there must be a
corresponding \code{x-amz-checksum} or \code{x-amz-trailer} header sent.
Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code
\verb{400 Bad Request}. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided
\code{ChecksumAlgorithm} parameter.}

\item{LifecycleConfiguration}{Container for lifecycle rules. You can add as many as 1,000 rules.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
\verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}
}
\description{
Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an existing lifecycle configuration. Keep in mind that this will overwrite an existing lifecycle configuration, so if you want to retain any configuration details, they must be included in the new lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle configuration, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html}{Managing your storage lifecycle}.
