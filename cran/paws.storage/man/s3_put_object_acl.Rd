\arguments{
\item{ACL}{The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see Canned
ACL.}

\item{AccessControlPolicy}{Contains the elements that set the ACL permissions for an object per
grantee.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name that contains the object to which you want to attach the
ACL.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access
points in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ContentMD5}{The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the data. This header must be
used as a message integrity check to verify that the request body was
not corrupted in transit. For more information, go to RFC 1864.\>

For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface
(CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated
automatically.}

\item{ChecksumAlgorithm}{Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when
using the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality
if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there must be a
corresponding \code{x-amz-checksum} or \code{x-amz-trailer} header sent.
Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code
\verb{400 Bad Request}. For more information, see Checking object integrity
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided
\code{ChecksumAlgorithm} parameter.}

\item{GrantFullControl}{Allows grantee the read, write, read ACP, and write ACP permissions on
the bucket.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantRead}{Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantReadACP}{Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantWrite}{Allows grantee to create new objects in the bucket.

For the bucket and object owners of existing objects, also allows
deletions and overwrites of those objects.}

\item{GrantWriteACP}{Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucket.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{Key}{[required] Key for which the PUT action was initiated.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access
points in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using
Amazon S3 on Outposts in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{VersionId}{VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
\verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}
}
\description{
Uses the \code{acl} subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have \code{WRITE_ACP} permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see What permissions can I grant? in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.
