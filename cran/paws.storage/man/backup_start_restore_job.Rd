\usage{
backup_start_restore_job(RecoveryPointArn, Metadata, IamRoleArn,
  IdempotencyToken, ResourceType)
}
\arguments{
\item{RecoveryPointArn}{[required] An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example,
\verb{arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45}.}

\item{Metadata}{[required] A set of metadata key-value pairs. Contains information, such as a
resource name, required to restore a recovery point.

You can get configuration metadata about a resource at the time it was
backed up by calling \code{GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata}. However, values
in addition to those provided by \code{GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata} might
be required to restore a resource. For example, you might need to
provide a new resource name if the original already exists.

You need to specify specific metadata to restore an Amazon Elastic File
System (Amazon EFS) instance:
\itemize{
\item \code{file-system-id}: ID of the Amazon EFS file system that is backed up
by AWS Backup. Returned in \code{GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata}.
\item \code{Encrypted}: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the file
system is encrypted. If \code{KmsKeyId} is specified, \code{Encrypted} must be
set to \code{true}.
\item \code{KmsKeyId}: Specifies the AWS KMS key that is used to encrypt the
restored file system.
\item \code{PerformanceMode}: Specifies the throughput mode of the file system.
\item \code{CreationToken}: A user-supplied value that ensures the uniqueness
(idempotency) of the request.
\item \code{newFileSystem}: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the
recovery point is restored to a new Amazon EFS file system.
}}

\item{IamRoleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that AWS Backup uses to
create the target recovery point; for example,
\verb{arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access}.}

\item{IdempotencyToken}{A customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls
to \code{StartRestoreJob}.}

\item{ResourceType}{Starts a job to restore a recovery point for one of the following
resources:
\itemize{
\item \code{DynamoDB} for Amazon DynamoDB
\item \code{EBS} for Amazon Elastic Block Store
\item \code{EC2} for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
\item \code{EFS} for Amazon Elastic File System
\item \code{RDS} for Amazon Relational Database Service
\item \verb{Storage Gateway} for AWS Storage Gateway
}}
}
\description{
Recovers the saved resource identified by an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
}
\details{
If the resource ARN is included in the request, then the last complete
backup of that resource is recovered. If the ARN of a recovery point is
supplied, then that recovery point is restored.
