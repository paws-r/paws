\title{This action gets a bucket policy for an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket}
\usage{
s3control_get_bucket_policy(AccountId, Bucket)
}
\arguments{
\item{AccountId}{[required] The AWS account ID of the Outposts bucket.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] Specifies the bucket.

For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API,
you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the AWS SDK and CLI,
you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format
\verb{arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>}.
For example, to access the bucket \code{reports} through outpost \code{my-outpost}
owned by account \code{123456789012} in Region \code{us-west-2}, use the URL
encoding of
\code{arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports}.
The value must be URL encoded.}
}
\value{
A list with the following syntax:\preformatted{list(
  Policy = "string"
)
}
}
\description{
This action gets a bucket policy for an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To
get a policy for an S3 bucket, see
\code{\link[=s3control_get_bucket_policy]{get_bucket_policy}} in the \emph{Amazon Simple
Storage Service API}.

Returns the policy of a specified Outposts bucket. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using Amazon S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account
that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the
\code{\link[=s3control_get_bucket_policy]{get_bucket_policy}} permissions on the
specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to
use this operation.

Only users from Outposts bucket owner account with the right permissions
can perform actions on an Outposts bucket. If you don't have
\code{s3-outposts:GetBucketPolicy} permissions or you're not using an
identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a
\verb{403 Access Denied} error.

As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a
bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly
denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

For more information about bucket policies, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-iam-policies.html}{Using Bucket Policies and User Policies}.

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
additional parameter of \code{x-amz-outpost-id} to be passed with the request
and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of \code{s3-control}.
For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses
the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the \code{x-amz-outpost-id}
derived using the access point ARN, see the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketPolicy.html#API_control_GetBucketPolicy_Examples}{Examples}
section.
