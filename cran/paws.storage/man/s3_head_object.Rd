\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket that contains the object.

\strong{Directory buckets} - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
\code{ Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com}. Path-style
requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the
chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow
the format \code{ bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3} (for example,
\code{ DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3}). For information about bucket
naming restrictions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html}{Directory bucket naming rules}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

\strong{Access points} - When you use this action with an access point, you
must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name
or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you
must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point
hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by
directory buckets.

\strong{S3 on Outposts} - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on
Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The
S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/s3-outposts/S3onOutposts.html}{What is S3 on Outposts?}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{IfMatch}{Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the one
specified; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

If both of the \code{If-Match} and \code{If-Unmodified-Since} headers are present
in the request as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{If-Match} condition evaluates to \code{true}, and;
\item \code{If-Unmodified-Since} condition evaluates to \code{false};
}

Then Amazon S3 returns \verb{200 OK} and the data requested.

For more information about conditional requests, see \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232}{RFC 7232}.}

\item{IfModifiedSince}{Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time;
otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

If both of the \code{If-None-Match} and \code{If-Modified-Since} headers are
present in the request as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{If-None-Match} condition evaluates to \code{false}, and;
\item \code{If-Modified-Since} condition evaluates to \code{true};
}

Then Amazon S3 returns the \verb{304 Not Modified} response code.

For more information about conditional requests, see \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232}{RFC 7232}.}

\item{IfNoneMatch}{Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from the
one specified; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

If both of the \code{If-None-Match} and \code{If-Modified-Since} headers are
present in the request as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{If-None-Match} condition evaluates to \code{false}, and;
\item \code{If-Modified-Since} condition evaluates to \code{true};
}

Then Amazon S3 returns the \verb{304 Not Modified} response code.

For more information about conditional requests, see \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232}{RFC 7232}.}

\item{IfUnmodifiedSince}{Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified
time; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

If both of the \code{If-Match} and \code{If-Unmodified-Since} headers are present
in the request as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{If-Match} condition evaluates to \code{true}, and;
\item \code{If-Unmodified-Since} condition evaluates to \code{false};
}

Then Amazon S3 returns \verb{200 OK} and the data requested.

For more information about conditional requests, see \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232}{RFC 7232}.}

\item{Key}{[required] The object key.}

\item{Range}{HeadObject returns only the metadata for an object. If the Range is
satisfiable, only the \code{ContentLength} is affected in the response. If
the Range is not satisfiable, S3 returns a
\verb{416 - Requested Range Not Satisfiable} error.}

\item{ResponseCacheControl}{Sets the \code{Cache-Control} header of the response.}

\item{ResponseContentDisposition}{Sets the \code{Content-Disposition} header of the response.}

\item{ResponseContentEncoding}{Sets the \code{Content-Encoding} header of the response.}

\item{ResponseContentLanguage}{Sets the \code{Content-Language} header of the response.}

\item{ResponseContentType}{Sets the \code{Content-Type} header of the response.}

\item{ResponseExpires}{Sets the \code{Expires} header of the response.}

\item{VersionId}{Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

For directory buckets in this API operation, only the \code{null} value of
the version ID is supported.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example,
AES256).

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm} header.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{PartNumber}{Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between
1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for the part
specified. Useful querying about the size of the part and the number of
parts in this object.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails
with the HTTP status code \verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}

\item{ChecksumMode}{To retrieve the checksum, this parameter must be enabled.

\strong{General purpose buckets} - If you enable checksum mode and the object
is uploaded with a
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Checksum.html}{checksum}
and encrypted with an Key Management Service (KMS) key, you must have
permission to use the \code{kms:Decrypt} action to retrieve the checksum.

\strong{Directory buckets} - If you enable \code{ChecksumMode} and the object is
encrypted with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web
Services KMS), you must also have the \code{kms:GenerateDataKey} and
\code{kms:Decrypt} permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key
policies for the KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.}

\description{
The \code{HEAD} operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This operation is useful if you're interested only in an object's metadata.
