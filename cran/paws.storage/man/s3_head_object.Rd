\usage{
s3_head_object(Bucket, IfMatch, IfModifiedSince, IfNoneMatch,
  IfUnmodifiedSince, Key, Range, VersionId, SSECustomerAlgorithm,
  SSECustomerKey, SSECustomerKeyMD5, RequestPayer, PartNumber,
  ExpectedBucketOwner)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket containing the object.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.\emph{outpostID}.s3-outposts.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{IfMatch}{Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the one
specified, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).}

\item{IfModifiedSince}{Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time,
otherwise return a 304 (not modified).}

\item{IfNoneMatch}{Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from the
one specified, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).}

\item{IfUnmodifiedSince}{Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified
time, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).}

\item{Key}{[required] The object key.}

\item{Range}{Downloads the specified range bytes of an object. For more information
about the HTTP Range header, see
\url{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35}.

Amazon S3 doesn't support retrieving multiple ranges of data per \code{GET}
request.}

\item{VersionId}{VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
example, AES256).}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm} header.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{PartNumber}{Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between
1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for the part
specified. Useful querying about the size of the part and the number of
parts in this object.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
\verb{403 (Access Denied)} error.}

\description{
The HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning
the object itself. This operation is useful if you're only interested in
an object's metadata. To use HEAD, you must have READ access to the
object.

A \code{HEAD} request has the same options as a \code{GET} operation on an object.
The response is identical to the \code{GET} response except that there is no
response body.

If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with
customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in
Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must
use the following headers:
\itemize{
\item x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
\item x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
\item x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
}

For more information about SSE-C, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html}{Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)}.

Encryption request headers, like \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption}, should
not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption
with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with
Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use
these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html}{Common Request Headers}.

Consider the following when using request headers:
\itemize{
\item Consideration 1 – If both of the \code{If-Match} and
\code{If-Unmodified-Since} headers are present in the request as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{If-Match} condition evaluates to \code{true}, and;
\item \code{If-Unmodified-Since} condition evaluates to \code{false};
}

Then Amazon S3 returns \verb{200 OK} and the data requested.
\item Consideration 2 – If both of the \code{If-None-Match} and
\code{If-Modified-Since} headers are present in the request as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{If-None-Match} condition evaluates to \code{false}, and;
\item \code{If-Modified-Since} condition evaluates to \code{true};
}

Then Amazon S3 returns the \verb{304 Not Modified} response code.
}

For more information about conditional requests, see \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232}{RFC 7232}.

\strong{Permissions}

You need the \code{s3:GetObject} permission for this operation. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html}{Specifying Permissions in a Policy}.
If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns
depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.
\itemize{
\item If you have the \code{s3:ListBucket} permission on the bucket, Amazon S3
returns an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.
\item If you don’t have the \code{s3:ListBucket} permission, Amazon S3 returns
an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.
}
