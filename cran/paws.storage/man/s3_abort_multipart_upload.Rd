\title{This operation aborts a multipart upload}
\usage{
s3_abort_multipart_upload(Bucket, Key, UploadId, RequestPayer,
  ExpectedBucketOwner)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name to which the upload was taking place.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.\emph{outpostID}.s3-outposts.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{Key}{[required] Key of the object for which the multipart upload was initiated.}

\item{UploadId}{[required] Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
\verb{403 (Access Denied)} error.}
}
\value{
A list with the following syntax:\preformatted{list(
  RequestCharged = "requester"
)
}
}
\description{
This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is
aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The
storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed.
However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part
uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary
to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely
free all storage consumed by all parts.

To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for
the part storage, you should call the \code{\link[=s3_list_parts]{list_parts}}
operation and ensure that the parts list is empty.

For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload
API, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html}{Multipart Upload API and Permissions}.
