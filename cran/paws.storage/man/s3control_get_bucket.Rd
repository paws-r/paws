\item{Bucket}{[required] Specifies the bucket.

For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API,
you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the AWS SDK and CLI,
you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format
\verb{arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>}.
For example, to access the bucket \code{reports} through outpost \code{my-outpost}
owned by account \code{123456789012} in Region \code{us-west-2}, use the URL
encoding of
\code{arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports}.

\value{
A list with the following syntax:\preformatted{list(

\description{
Gets an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using Amazon S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account
that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the
\code{s3-outposts:GetBucket} permissions on the specified bucket and belong
to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation. Only users
from Outposts bucket owner account with the right permissions can
perform actions on an Outposts bucket.

If you don't have \code{s3-outposts:GetBucket} permissions or you're not
using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3
returns a \verb{403 Access Denied} error.

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
additional parameter of \code{x-amz-outpost-id} to be passed with the request
and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of \code{s3-control}.
For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses
the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the \code{x-amz-outpost-id}
