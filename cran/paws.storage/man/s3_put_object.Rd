\arguments{
\item{ACL}{The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL}{Canned ACL}.}

\item{Body}{Object data.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] Bucket name to which the PUT operation was initiated.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs,
you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{CacheControl}{Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
For more information, see
\url{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9}.}

\item{ContentDisposition}{Specifies presentational information for the object. For more
information, see
\url{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1}.}

\item{ContentEncoding}{Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
referenced by the Content-Type header field. For more information, see
\url{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11}.}

\item{ContentLanguage}{The language the content is in.}

\item{ContentLength}{Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the
body cannot be determined automatically. For more information, see
\url{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13}.}

\item{ContentMD5}{The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the message (without the
headers) according to RFC 1864. This header can be used as a message
integrity check to verify that the data is the same data that was
originally sent. Although it is optional, we recommend using the
Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For more
information about REST request authentication, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html}{REST Authentication}.}

\item{ContentType}{A standard MIME type describing the format of the contents. For more
information, see
\url{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17}.}

\item{Expires}{The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable. For more
information, see
\url{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21}.}

\item{GrantFullControl}{Gives the grantee READ, READ\\_ACP, and WRITE\\_ACP permissions on the
object.}

\item{GrantRead}{Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.}

\item{GrantReadACP}{Allows grantee to read the object ACL.}

\item{GrantWriteACP}{Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.}

\item{Key}{[required] Object key for which the PUT operation was initiated.}

\item{Metadata}{A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.}

\item{ServerSideEncryption}{The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).}

\item{StorageClass}{If you don\'t specify, Standard is the default storage class. Amazon S3
supports other storage classes.}

\item{WebsiteRedirectLocation}{If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For
information about object metadata, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html}{Object Key and Metadata}.

In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an
object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:

\verb{x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html}

In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to
another website:

\verb{x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/}

For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html}{Hosting Websites on Amazon S3}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html}{How to Configure Website Page Redirects}.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
example, AES256).}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\verb{x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-algorithm} header.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.}

\item{SSEKMSKeyId}{If \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption} is present and has the value of
\code{aws:kms}, this header specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management
Service (AWS KMS) symmetrical customer managed customer master key (CMK)
that was used for the object.

If the value of \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption} is \code{aws:kms}, this header
specifies the ID of the symmetric customer managed AWS KMS CMK that will
be used for the object. If you specify
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms}, but do not
provide\code{ x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id}, Amazon S3 uses
the AWS managed CMK in AWS to protect the data.}

\item{SSEKMSEncryptionContext}{Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption.
The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
with the encryption context key-value pairs.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{Tagging}{The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
parameters. (For example, \"Key1=Value1\")}

\item{ObjectLockMode}{The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.}

\item{ObjectLockRetainUntilDate}{The date and time when you want this object\'s Object Lock to expire.}

\item{ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus}{Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more
information about S3 Object Lock, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html}{Object Lock}.}
}
\description{
Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket
to add an object to it.
}
\details{
Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response,
Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.

Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write
requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the
last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you
need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use
versioning instead.

To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the
\code{Content-MD5} header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the
object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns
an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an
object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5
value.

To configure your application to send the request headers before sending
the request body, use the \code{100-continue} HTTP status code. For PUT
operations, this helps you avoid sending the message body if the message
is rejected based on the headers (for example, because authentication
fails or a redirect occurs). For more information on the \code{100-continue}
HTTP status code, see Section 8.2.3 of
\url{http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt}.

You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side
encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the
option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed encryption
keys. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html}{Using Server-Side Encryption}.

Access Permissions

:   You can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be
granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways
to grant the permissions using the request headers:\preformatted{-   Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. For
    more information, see [Canned
    ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).

-   Specify access permissions explicitly with the
    `x-amz-grant-read`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`,
    `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers.
    These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3
    supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control
    List (ACL)
    Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).

You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
explicitly. You cannot do both.
}

Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

:   You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using
server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data
encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to
disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The
option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed
encryption keys or provide your own encryption key.\preformatted{-   Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys
    (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) -- If you
    want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the
    following headers in the request.

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryption

    -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

    -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

    If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but
    don\\'t provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`,
    Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the
    data. If you want to use a customer managed AWS KMS CMK, you
    must provide the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`
    of the symmetric customer managed CMK. Amazon S3 only supports
    symmetric CMKs and not asymmetric CMKs. For more information,
    see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric
    Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
    in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail
    if you don\\'t make them with SSL or by using SigV4.

    For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs
    stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using
    Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in
    AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).

-   Use customer-provided encryption keys -- If you want to manage
    your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in
    the request.

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-algorithm

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key-MD5

    For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs
    stored in KMS (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side
    Encryption with CMKs stored in
    AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).
}

Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

:   You also can use the following access control--related headers with
this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner
has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant
permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups
defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the Access
Control List (ACL) on the object. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html}{Using ACLs}.
With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of
the following two methods:\preformatted{-   Specify a canned ACL (`x-amz-acl`) --- Amazon S3 supports a set
    of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a
    predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more
    information, see [Canned
    ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).

-   Specify access permissions explicitly --- To explicitly grant
    access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the
    following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that
    Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access
    Control List (ACL)
    Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).
    In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the
    specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly use:

    -   x-amz-grant-read

    -   x-amz-grant-write

    -   x-amz-grant-read-acp

    -   x-amz-grant-write-acp

    -   x-amz-grant-full-control

    You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is
    one of the following:

    -   `emailAddress` -- if the value specified is the email
        address of an AWS account

        Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported
        in the following AWS Regions:

        -   US East (N. Virginia)

        -   US West (N. California)

        -   US West (Oregon)

        -   Asia Pacific (Singapore)

        -   Asia Pacific (Sydney)

        -   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

        -   EU (Ireland)

        -   South America (SÃ£o Paulo)

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and
        endpoints, see [Regions and
        Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
        in the AWS General Reference

    -   `id` -- if the value specified is the canonical user ID of
        an AWS account

    -   `uri` -- if you are granting permissions to a predefined
        group

    For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants the
    AWS accounts identified by email addresses permissions to read
    object data and its metadata:

    `x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" `
}

Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

:   You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using
server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data
encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to
disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The
option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS-managed
encryption keys or provide your own encryption key.\preformatted{-   Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys
    (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) -- If you
    want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the
    following headers in the request.

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryption

    -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

    -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

    If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but
    don\\'t provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`,
    Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the
    data. If you want to use a customer managed AWS KMS CMK, you
    must provide the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`
    of the symmetric customer managed CMK. Amazon S3 only supports
    symmetric CMKs and not asymmetric CMKs. For more information,
    see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric
    Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
    in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail
    if you don\\'t make them with SSL or by using SigV4.

    For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs
    stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using
    Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
    KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).

-   Use customer-provided encryption keys -- If you want to manage
    your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in
    the request.

    If you use this feature, the ETag value that Amazon S3 returns
    in the response is not the MD5 of the object.

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-algorithm

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key

    -   x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key-MD5

    For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs
    stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using
    Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
    KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).
}

\strong{Storage Class Options}

By default, Amazon S3 uses the Standard storage class to store newly
created objects. The Standard storage class provides high durability and
high availability. You can specify other storage classes depending on
the performance needs. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html}{Storage Classes}
in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

\strong{Versioning}

If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates
a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this
ID in the response using the \verb{x-amz-version-id response} header. If
versioning is suspended, Amazon S3 always uses null as the version ID
for the object stored. For more information about returning the
versioning state of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning. If you enable
versioning for a bucket, when Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests
for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.
