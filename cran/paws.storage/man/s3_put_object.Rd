\arguments{
\item{ACL}{The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#CannedACL}{Canned ACL}.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{Body}{Object data.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name to which the PUT action was initiated.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using Amazon S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{CacheControl}{Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
For more information, see
\href{https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9}{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9}.}

\item{ContentDisposition}{Specifies presentational information for the object. For more
information, see
\href{https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1}{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.5.1}.}

\item{ContentEncoding}{Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
referenced by the Content-Type header field. For more information, see
\href{https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11}{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11}.}

\item{ContentLanguage}{The language the content is in.}

\item{ContentLength}{Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the
body cannot be determined automatically. For more information, see
\href{https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13}{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13}.}

\item{ContentMD5}{The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the message (without the
headers) according to RFC 1864. This header can be used as a message
integrity check to verify that the data is the same data that was
originally sent. Although it is optional, we recommend using the
Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For more
information about REST request authentication, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html}{REST Authentication}.}

\item{ContentType}{A standard MIME type describing the format of the contents. For more
information, see
\href{https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17}{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17}.}

\item{ChecksumAlgorithm}{Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when
using the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality
if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there must be a
corresponding \code{x-amz-checksum} or \code{x-amz-trailer} header sent.
Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code
\verb{400 Bad Request}. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided
\code{ChecksumAlgorithm} parameter.}

\item{ChecksumCRC32}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32 checksum of the object. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumCRC32C}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32C checksum of the object. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumSHA1}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the base64-encoded, 160-bit SHA-1 digest of the object. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumSHA256}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the base64-encoded, 256-bit SHA-256 digest of the object. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{Expires}{The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable. For more
information, see
\href{https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21}{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21}.}

\item{GrantFullControl}{Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the
object.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantRead}{Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantReadACP}{Allows grantee to read the object ACL.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantWriteACP}{Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{Key}{[required] Object key for which the PUT action was initiated.}

\item{Metadata}{A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.}

\item{ServerSideEncryption}{The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).}

\item{StorageClass}{By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
Storage Class. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html}{Storage Classes}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{WebsiteRedirectLocation}{If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For
information about object metadata, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingMetadata.html}{Object Key and Metadata}.

In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an
object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:

\verb{x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html}

In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to
another website:

\verb{x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/}

For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html}{Hosting Websites on Amazon S3}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-page-redirect.html}{How to Configure Website Page Redirects}.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
example, AES256).}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm} header.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.}

\item{SSEKMSKeyId}{If \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption} is present and has the value of
\code{aws:kms}, this header specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key
Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) symmetrical customer
managed key that was used for the object. If you specify
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms}, but do not
provide\code{ x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id}, Amazon S3 uses
the Amazon Web Services managed key to protect the data. If the KMS key
does not exist in the same account issuing the command, you must use the
full ARN and not just the ID.}

\item{SSEKMSEncryptionContext}{Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for
object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8
string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.}

\item{BucketKeyEnabled}{Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting
this header to \code{true} causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for
object encryption with SSE-KMS.

Specifying this header with a PUT action doesn’t affect bucket-level
settings for S3 Bucket Key.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{Tagging}{The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
parameters. (For example, "Key1=Value1")}

\item{ObjectLockMode}{The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.}

\item{ObjectLockRetainUntilDate}{The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire.
Must be formatted as a timestamp parameter.}

\item{ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus}{Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more
information about S3 Object Lock, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html}{Object Lock}.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
\verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}
