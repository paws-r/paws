\arguments{
\item{ACL}{The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#CannedACL}{Canned ACL}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

When adding a new object, you can use headers to grant ACL-based
permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined
groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL
on the object. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has
full access control. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html}{Access Control List (ACL) Overview}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/managing-acls.html}{Managing ACLs Using the REST API}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner
enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no
longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT
requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket
owner full control ACLs, such as the \code{bucket-owner-full-control} canned
ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT
requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain
Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a \code{400} error with the
error code \code{AccessControlListNotSupported}. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html}{Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.
\itemize{
\item This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
\item This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
}}

\item{Body}{Object data.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name to which the PUT action was initiated.

\strong{Directory buckets} - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
\code{ Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com}. Path-style
requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the
chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow
the format \code{ bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3} (for example,
\code{ DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3}). For information about bucket
naming restrictions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html}{Directory bucket naming rules}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

\strong{Access points} - When you use this action with an access point, you
must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name
or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you
must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point
hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by
directory buckets.

\strong{S3 on Outposts} - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on
Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The
S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/s3-outposts/S3onOutposts.html}{What is S3 on Outposts?}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{CacheControl}{Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
For more information, see
\href{https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9}{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9}.}

\item{ContentDisposition}{Specifies presentational information for the object. For more
information, see \url{https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6266#section-4}.}

\item{ContentEncoding}{Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
referenced by the Content-Type header field. For more information, see
\url{https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#field.content-encoding}.}

\item{ContentLanguage}{The language the content is in.}

\item{ContentLength}{Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the
body cannot be determined automatically. For more information, see
\url{https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-content-length}.}

\item{ContentMD5}{The Base64 encoded 128-bit \code{MD5} digest of the message (without the
headers) according to RFC 1864. This header can be used as a message
integrity check to verify that the data is the same data that was
originally sent. Although it is optional, we recommend using the
Content-MD5 mechanism as an end-to-end integrity check. For more
information about REST request authentication, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTAuthentication.html}{REST Authentication}.

The \code{Content-MD5} or \code{x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm} header is required
for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured
using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-managing.html#object-lock-put-object}{Uploading objects to an Object Lock enabled bucket}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{ContentType}{A standard MIME type describing the format of the contents. For more
information, see
\url{https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-content-type}.}

\item{ChecksumAlgorithm}{Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when
you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional
functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there
must be a corresponding \code{x-amz-checksum-algorithm } or \code{x-amz-trailer}
header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status
code \verb{400 Bad Request}.

For the \code{x-amz-checksum-algorithm } header, replace \code{algorithm} with
the supported algorithm from the following list:
\itemize{
\item \code{CRC-32}
\item \verb{CRC-32C}
\item \verb{CRC-64NVME}
\item \code{SHA-1}
\item \code{SHA-256}
}

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

If the individual checksum value you provide through
\code{x-amz-checksum-algorithm } doesn't match the checksum algorithm you set
through \code{x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm}, Amazon S3 fails the request with
a \code{BadDigest} error.

The \code{Content-MD5} or \code{x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm} header is required
for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured
using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-managing.html#object-lock-put-object}{Uploading objects to an Object Lock enabled bucket}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

For directory buckets, when you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, \code{CRC32} is
the default checksum algorithm that's used for performance.}

\item{ChecksumCRC32}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit \code{CRC-32} checksum of the object.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumCRC32C}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit \verb{CRC-32C} checksum of the object.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumCRC64NVME}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 64-bit \verb{CRC-64NVME} checksum of the
object. The \verb{CRC-64NVME} checksum is always a full object checksum. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumSHA1}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 160-bit \code{SHA-1} digest of the object. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumSHA256}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 256-bit \code{SHA-256} digest of the object.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{Expires}{The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable. For more
information, see \url{https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7234#section-5.3}.}

\item{IfMatch}{Uploads the object only if the ETag (entity tag) value provided during
the WRITE operation matches the ETag of the object in S3. If the ETag
values do not match, the operation returns a \verb{412 Precondition Failed}
error.

If a conflicting operation occurs during the upload S3 returns a
\verb{409 ConditionalRequestConflict} response. On a 409 failure you should
fetch the object's ETag and retry the upload.

Expects the ETag value as a string.

For more information about conditional requests, see \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232}{RFC 7232}, or \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/conditional-requests.html}{Conditional requests}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{IfNoneMatch}{Uploads the object only if the object key name does not already exist in
the bucket specified. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns a
\verb{412 Precondition Failed} error.

If a conflicting operation occurs during the upload S3 returns a
\verb{409 ConditionalRequestConflict} response. On a 409 failure you should
retry the upload.

Expects the '*' (asterisk) character.

For more information about conditional requests, see \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232}{RFC 7232}, or \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/conditional-requests.html}{Conditional requests}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{GrantFullControl}{Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the
object.
\itemize{
\item This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
\item This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
}}

\item{GrantRead}{Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
\itemize{
\item This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
\item This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
}}

\item{GrantReadACP}{Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
\itemize{
\item This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
\item This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
}}

\item{GrantWriteACP}{Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
\itemize{
\item This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
\item This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
}}

\item{Key}{[required] Object key for which the PUT action was initiated.}

\item{WriteOffsetBytes}{Specifies the offset for appending data to existing objects in bytes.
The offset must be equal to the size of the existing object being
appended to. If no object exists, setting this header to 0 will create a
new object.

This functionality is only supported for objects in the Amazon S3
Express One Zone storage class in directory buckets.}

\item{Metadata}{A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.}

\item{ServerSideEncryption}{The server-side encryption algorithm that was used when you store this
object in Amazon S3 (for example, \code{AES256}, \code{aws:kms}, \code{aws:kms:dsse}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{General purpose buckets} - You have four mutually exclusive
options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3,
depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys.
Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys
(SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS), and
customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with
server-side encryption by using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by
default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest
by using server-side encryption with other key options. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html}{Using Server-Side Encryption}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.
\item \strong{Directory buckets} - For directory buckets, there are only two
supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption
with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (\code{AES256}) and server-side
encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (\code{aws:kms}). We recommend that
the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption
configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption
in your \code{\link[=s3_create_session]{create_session}} requests or \code{PUT}
object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with
the desired encryption settings. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/}{Protecting data with server-side encryption}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}. For more information about the
encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html}{Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads}.

In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except
\code{\link[=s3_copy_object]{copy_object}} and
\code{\link[=s3_upload_part_copy]{upload_part_copy}}) using the REST API, the
encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that
are specified in the \code{\link[=s3_create_session]{create_session}} request.
You can't override the values of the encryption settings
(\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption},
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id},
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-context}, and
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled}) that are
specified in the \code{\link[=s3_create_session]{create_session}} request. You
don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in
Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the encryption
settings values from the \code{\link[=s3_create_session]{create_session}}
request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.

When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for
\code{\link[=s3_create_session]{create_session}}, the session token refreshes
automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.
The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default
encryption configuration for the
\code{\link[=s3_create_session]{create_session}} request. It's not supported to
override the encryption settings values in the
\code{\link[=s3_create_session]{create_session}} request. So in the Zonal
endpoint API calls (except \code{\link[=s3_copy_object]{copy_object}} and
\code{\link[=s3_upload_part_copy]{upload_part_copy}}), the encryption request
headers must match the default encryption configuration of the
directory bucket.
}}

\item{StorageClass}{By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
different Storage Class. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html}{Storage Classes}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.
\itemize{
\item For directory buckets, only the S3 Express One Zone storage class is
supported to store newly created objects.
\item Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class.
}}

\item{WebsiteRedirectLocation}{If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For
information about object metadata, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingMetadata.html}{Object Key and Metadata}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an
object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:

\verb{x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html}

In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to
another website:

\verb{x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/}

For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html}{Hosting Websites on Amazon S3}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-page-redirect.html}{How to Configure Website Page Redirects}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example,
\code{AES256}).

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm} header.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{SSEKMSKeyId}{Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for
object encryption. If the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account
that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key
ID.

\strong{General purpose buckets} - If you specify
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption} with \code{aws:kms} or \code{aws:kms:dsse}, this
header specifies the ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) of the KMS key
to use. If you specify \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms} or
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse}, but do not provide
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id}, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon
Web Services managed key (\code{aws/s3}) to protect the data.

\strong{Directory buckets} - If you specify \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption}
with \code{aws:kms}, the \code{ x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id}
header is implicitly assigned the ID of the KMS symmetric encryption
customer managed key that's configured for your directory bucket's
default encryption setting. If you want to specify the
\code{ x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id} header explicitly, you
can only specify it with the ID (Key ID or Key ARN) of the KMS customer
managed key that's configured for your directory bucket's default
encryption setting. Otherwise, you get an HTTP \verb{400 Bad Request} error.
Only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key
isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk}{customer managed key}
per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. The \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk}{Amazon Web Services managed key}
(\code{aws/s3}) isn't supported.}

\item{SSEKMSEncryptionContext}{Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an
additional encryption context to use for object encryption. The value of
this header is a Base64 encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON, which
contains the encryption context as key-value pairs. This value is stored
as object metadata and automatically gets passed on to Amazon Web
Services KMS for future \code{\link[=s3_get_object]{get_object}} operations on this
object.

\strong{General purpose buckets} - This value must be explicitly added during
\code{\link[=s3_copy_object]{copy_object}} operations if you want an additional
encryption context for your object. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html#encryption-context}{Encryption context}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

\strong{Directory buckets} - You can optionally provide an explicit
encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption
context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional
encryption context value is not supported.}

\item{BucketKeyEnabled}{Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service
(KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).

\strong{General purpose buckets} - Setting this header to \code{true} causes
Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS.
Also, specifying this header with a PUT action doesn't affect
bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

\strong{Directory buckets} - S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for \code{GET} and
\code{PUT} operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket
Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from
general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to
general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through
\code{\link[=s3_copy_object]{copy_object}},
\code{\link[=s3_upload_part_copy]{upload_part_copy}}, \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-Batch-Ops.html}{the Copy operation in Batch Operations},
or \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-import-job.html}{the import jobs}.
In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is
made for a KMS-encrypted object.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{Tagging}{The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
parameters. (For example, "Key1=Value1")

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{ObjectLockMode}{The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{ObjectLockRetainUntilDate}{The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire.
Must be formatted as a timestamp parameter.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus}{Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more
information about S3 Object Lock, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html}{Object Lock}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails
with the HTTP status code \verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}
