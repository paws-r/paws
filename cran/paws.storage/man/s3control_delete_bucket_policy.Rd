\title{This API operation deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket policy}
\usage{
s3control_delete_bucket_policy(AccountId, Bucket)
}
\arguments{
\item{AccountId}{[required] The account ID of the Outposts bucket.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] Specifies the bucket.

For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API,
you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the AWS SDK and CLI,
you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format
\verb{arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>}.
For example, to access the bucket \code{reports} through outpost \code{my-outpost}
owned by account \code{123456789012} in Region \code{us-west-2}, use the URL
encoding of
\code{arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports}.
The value must be URL encoded.}
}
\value{
An empty list.
}
\description{
This API operation deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket policy. To
delete an S3 bucket policy, see
\code{\link[=s3control_delete_bucket_policy]{delete_bucket_policy}} in the \emph{Amazon
Simple Storage Service API}.

This implementation of the DELETE operation uses the policy subresource
to delete the policy of a specified Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. If you
are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that
owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the
\code{s3-outposts:DeleteBucketPolicy} permissions on the specified Outposts
bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this operation.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using Amazon S3 on Outposts}
in \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

If you don't have
\code{\link[=s3control_delete_bucket_policy]{delete_bucket_policy}} permissions,
Amazon S3 returns a \verb{403 Access Denied} error. If you have the correct
permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket
owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a \verb{405 Method Not Allowed} error.

As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a
bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly
denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

For more information about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies
and User Policies.

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
additional parameter of \code{x-amz-outpost-id} to be passed with the request
and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of \code{s3-control}.
For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses
the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the \code{x-amz-outpost-id}
derived using the access point ARN, see the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketPolicy.html#API_control_DeleteBucketPolicy_Examples}{Examples}
section.
