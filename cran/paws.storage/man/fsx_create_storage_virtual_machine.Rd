\title{Creates a storage virtual machine (SVM) for an Amazon FSx for ONTAP file
system}
\usage{
fsx_create_storage_virtual_machine(
  ActiveDirectoryConfiguration = NULL,
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  FileSystemId,
  Name,
  SvmAdminPassword = NULL,
  Tags = NULL,
  RootVolumeSecurityStyle = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ActiveDirectoryConfiguration}{Describes the self-managed Microsoft Active Directory to which you want
to join the SVM. Joining an Active Directory provides user
authentication and access control for SMB clients, including Microsoft
Windows and macOS client accessing the file system.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{}

\item{FileSystemId}{[required]}

\item{Name}{[required] The name of the SVM.}

\item{SvmAdminPassword}{The password to use when managing the SVM using the NetApp ONTAP CLI or
REST API. If you do not specify a password, you can still use the file
system's \code{fsxadmin} user to manage the SVM.}

\item{Tags}{}

\item{RootVolumeSecurityStyle}{The security style of the root volume of the SVM. Specify one of the
following values:
\itemize{
\item \code{UNIX} if the file system is managed by a UNIX administrator, the
majority of users are NFS clients, and an application accessing the
data uses a UNIX user as the service account.
\item \code{NTFS} if the file system is managed by a Windows administrator, the
majority of users are SMB clients, and an application accessing the
data uses a Windows user as the service account.
\item \code{MIXED} if the file system is managed by both UNIX and Windows
administrators and users consist of both NFS and SMB clients.
