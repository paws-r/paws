\description{
Amazon Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for "cold data."

Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure,
durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With
Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months,
years, or decades. Glacier also enables customers to offload the
administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they
don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data
replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware
migrations.

Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and
your data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or
frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more
information, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/s3/}{Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)}.

You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit
on the total amount of data you can store in Glacier.

If you are a first-time user of Glacier, we recommend that you begin by
reading the following sections in the \emph{Amazon Glacier Developer Guide}:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html}{What is Amazon Glacier} -
This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data
model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use
to interact with the service.
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html}{Getting Started with Amazon Glacier} -
The Getting Started section walks you through the process of
creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download
archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.
}
