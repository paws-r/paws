When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more

in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

retrieve.}

\item{VersionId}{The version ID of the object whose Legal Hold status you want to
retrieve.}

different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
\verb{403 (Access Denied)} error.}
