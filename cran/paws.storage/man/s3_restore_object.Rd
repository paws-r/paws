\usage{
s3_restore_object(Bucket, Key, VersionId, RestoreRequest, RequestPayer,
  ExpectedBucketOwner)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name containing the object to restore.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.\emph{outpostID}.s3-outposts.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{Key}{[required] Object key for which the operation was initiated.}

\item{VersionId}{VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.}

\item{RestoreRequest}{}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
\verb{403 (Access Denied)} error.}

\description{
Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

This action performs the following types of requests:
\itemize{
\item \code{select} - Perform a select query on an archived object
\item \verb{restore an archive} - Restore an archived object
}

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
\code{s3:RestoreObject} action. The bucket owner has this permission by
default and can grant this permission to others. For more information
about permissions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources}{Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html}{Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

\strong{Querying Archives with Select Requests}

You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived
objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select
request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV)
files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data
without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an
overview about select requests, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/querying-glacier-archives.html}{Querying Archived Objects}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

When making a select request, do the following:
\itemize{
\item Define an output location for the select query's output. This must
be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the bucket that
contains the archive object that is being queried. The AWS account
that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3
bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the
output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about
output, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/querying-glacier-archives.html}{Querying Archived Objects}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

For more information about the \code{S3} structure in the request body,
see the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=s3_put_object]{put_object}}
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl_overview.html}{Managing Access with ACLs}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html}{Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}
}
\item Define the SQL expression for the \code{SELECT} type of restoration for
your query in the request body's \code{SelectParameters} structure. You
can use expressions like the following examples.
\itemize{
\item The following expression returns all records from the specified
object.

\verb{SELECT * FROM Object}
\item Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in
the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.

\verb{SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100}
\item If you have headers and you set the \code{fileHeaderInfo} in the
\code{CSV} structure in the request body to \code{USE}, you can specify
headers in the query. (If you set the \code{fileHeaderInfo} field to
\code{IGNORE}, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot
mix ordinal positions with header column names.

\verb{SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s}
}
}

For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html}{SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

When making a select request, you can also do the following:
\itemize{
\item To expedite your queries, specify the \code{Expedited} tier. For more
information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this
topic.
\item Specify details about the data serialization format of both the
input object that is being queried and the serialization of the
CSV-encoded query results.
}

The following are additional important facts about the select feature:
\itemize{
\item The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive
retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or
through a lifecycle policy.
\item You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3
object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing
duplicate requests.
\item Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already
been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response \code{409}.
}

\strong{Restoring objects}

Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive
storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3
Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time.
For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must
first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is
moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3
Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore
request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is
available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for
the duration (number of days) that you specify.

To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If
you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can
specify one of the following data access tier options in the \code{Tier}
element of the request body:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{Expedited}} - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access
your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3
Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for
a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived
objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is
typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity
ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is
available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned
capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep
Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
\item \strong{\code{Standard}} - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your
archived objects within several hours. This is the default option
for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option.
Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects
stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects
stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3
Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free
for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
\item \strong{\code{Bulk}} - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in
S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes,
of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12
hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3
Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48
hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage
class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals
are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
}

For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned
capacity for \code{Expedited} data access, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/restoring-objects.html}{Restoring Archived Objects}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed
to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html}{Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

To get the status of object restoration, you can send a \code{HEAD} request.
Operations return the \code{x-amz-restore} header, which provides information
about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3
event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or
completed. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html}{Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration
period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the
restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the
request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the
restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current
restore request for the object.

If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes
an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that
you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object
copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days,
Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about
lifecycle configuration, see
\code{\link[=s3_put_bucket_lifecycle_configuration]{put_bucket_lifecycle_configuration}}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html}{Object Lifecycle Management}
in \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

\strong{Responses}

A successful operation returns either the \verb{200 OK} or \verb{202 Accepted}
status code.
\itemize{
\item If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns
\verb{202 Accepted} in the response.
\item If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns \verb{200 OK} in
the response.
}

\strong{Special Errors}
\itemize{
\item 
\itemize{
\item \emph{Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress}
\item \emph{Cause: Object restore is already in progress. (This error does
not apply to SELECT type requests.)}
\item \emph{HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict}
\item \emph{SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client}
}
\item 
\itemize{
\item \emph{Code: GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable}
\item \emph{Cause: expedited retrievals are currently not available. Try
again later. (Returned if there is insufficient capacity to
process the Expedited request. This error applies only to
Expedited retrievals and not to S3 Standard or Bulk
retrievals.)}
\item \emph{HTTP Status Code: 503}
\item \emph{SOAP Fault Code Prefix: N/A}
}
