\title{You can use this operation to determine if a bucket exists and if you
have permission to access it}
\usage{
s3_head_bucket(Bucket, ExpectedBucketOwner = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name.

\strong{Directory buckets} - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
\code{ Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com}. Path-style
requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the
chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow
the format \code{ bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3} (for example,
\code{ DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3}). For information about bucket
naming restrictions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html}{Directory bucket naming rules}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

\strong{Access points} - When you use this action with an access point, you
must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name
or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you
must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point
hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

\strong{Object Lambda access points} - When you use this API operation with
an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda
access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access
point alias in a request is not valid, the error code
\code{InvalidAccessPointAliasError} is returned. For more information about
\code{InvalidAccessPointAliasError}, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList}{List of Error Codes}.

Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by
directory buckets.

\strong{S3 on Outposts} - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on
Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The
S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/s3-outposts/S3onOutposts.html}{What is S3 on Outposts?}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails
with the HTTP status code \verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}
}
\description{
You can use this operation to determine if a bucket exists and if you have permission to access it. The action returns a \verb{200 OK} if the bucket exists and you have permission to access it.
