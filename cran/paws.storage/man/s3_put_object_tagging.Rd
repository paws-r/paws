}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name containing the object.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using Amazon S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{Key}{[required] Name of the object key.}

\item{VersionId}{The versionId of the object that the tag-set will be added to.}

\item{ContentMD5}{The MD5 hash for the request body.

For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface
(CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated
automatically.}

\item{ChecksumAlgorithm}{Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when
using the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality
if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there must be a
corresponding \code{x-amz-checksum} or \code{x-amz-trailer} header sent.
Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code
\verb{400 Bad Request}. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided
\code{ChecksumAlgorithm} parameter.}

\item{Tagging}{[required] Container for the \code{TagSet} and \code{Tag} elements}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
\verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}

\item{RequestPayer}{}
}
