\description{
Deletes the replication configuration from the bucket.

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
\code{s3:PutReplicationConfiguration} action. The bucket owner has these
permissions by default and can grant it to others. For more information
about permissions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources}{Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html}{Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources}.

It can take a while for the deletion of a replication configuration to
fully propagate.

For information about replication configuration, see Replication in the
\emph{Amazon S3 Developer Guide}.
