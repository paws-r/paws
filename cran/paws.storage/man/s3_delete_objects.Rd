\title{This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket
using a single HTTP request}
\usage{
s3_delete_objects(
  Bucket,
  Delete,
  MFA = NULL,
  RequestPayer = NULL,
  BypassGovernanceRetention = NULL,
  ExpectedBucketOwner = NULL,
  ChecksumAlgorithm = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name containing the objects to delete.

\strong{Directory buckets} - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
\code{ Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com}. Path-style
requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the
chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow
the format \code{ bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3} (for example,
\code{ DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3}). For information about bucket
naming restrictions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html}{Directory bucket naming rules}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

\strong{Access points} - When you use this action with an access point, you
must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name
or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you
must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point
hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by
directory buckets.

\strong{S3 on Outposts} - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on
Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The
S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/s3-outposts/S3onOutposts.html}{What is S3 on Outposts?}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{Delete}{[required] Container for the request.}

\item{MFA}{The concatenation of the authentication device's serial number, a space,
and the value that is displayed on your authentication device. Required
to permanently delete a versioned object if versioning is configured
with MFA delete enabled.

When performing the \code{\link[=s3_delete_objects]{delete_objects}} operation on
an MFA delete enabled bucket, which attempts to delete the specified
versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you don't provide
an MFA token, the entire request will fail, even if there are
non-versioned objects that you are trying to delete. If you provide an
invalid token, whether there are versioned object keys in the request or
not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information
about MFA Delete, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete}{MFA Delete}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{BypassGovernanceRetention}{Specifies whether you want to delete this object even if it has a
Governance-type Object Lock in place. To use this header, you must have
the \code{s3:BypassGovernanceRetention} permission.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails
with the HTTP status code \verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}

\item{ChecksumAlgorithm}{Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when
you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional
functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there
must be a corresponding \code{x-amz-checksum-algorithm } or \code{x-amz-trailer}
header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status
code \verb{400 Bad Request}.

For the \code{x-amz-checksum-algorithm } header, replace \code{algorithm} with
the supported algorithm from the following list:
\itemize{
\item \code{CRC-32}
\item \verb{CRC-32C}
\item \verb{CRC-64NVME}
\item \code{SHA-1}
\item \code{SHA-256}
}

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

If the individual checksum value you provide through
\code{x-amz-checksum-algorithm } doesn't match the checksum algorithm you set
through \code{x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm}, Amazon S3 fails the request with
a \code{BadDigest} error.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided
\code{ChecksumAlgorithm} parameter.}

\description{
This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.
