\title{Removes an object from a bucket}
\usage{
s3_delete_object(
  Bucket,
  Key,
  MFA = NULL,
  VersionId = NULL,
  RequestPayer = NULL,
  BypassGovernanceRetention = NULL,
  ExpectedBucketOwner = NULL,
  IfMatch = NULL,
  IfMatchLastModifiedTime = NULL,
  IfMatchSize = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name of the bucket containing the object.

\strong{Directory buckets} - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
\code{ Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com}. Path-style
requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the
chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow
the format \code{ bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3} (for example,
\code{ DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3}). For information about bucket
naming restrictions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html}{Directory bucket naming rules}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

\strong{Access points} - When you use this action with an access point, you
must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name
or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you
must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point
hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by
directory buckets.

\strong{S3 on Outposts} - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on
Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The
S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/s3-outposts/S3onOutposts.html}{What is S3 on Outposts?}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{Key}{[required] Key name of the object to delete.}

\item{MFA}{The concatenation of the authentication device's serial number, a space,
and the value that is displayed on your authentication device. Required
to permanently delete a versioned object if versioning is configured
with MFA delete enabled.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{VersionId}{Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

For directory buckets in this API operation, only the \code{null} value of
the version ID is supported.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{BypassGovernanceRetention}{Indicates whether S3 Object Lock should bypass Governance-mode
restrictions to process this operation. To use this header, you must
have the \code{s3:BypassGovernanceRetention} permission.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails
with the HTTP status code \verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}

\item{IfMatch}{The \code{If-Match} header field makes the request method conditional on
ETags. If the ETag value does not match, the operation returns a
\verb{412 Precondition Failed} error. If the ETag matches or if the object
doesn't exist, the operation will return a
\verb{204 Success (No Content) response}.

For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.

This functionality is only supported for directory buckets.}

\item{IfMatchLastModifiedTime}{If present, the object is deleted only if its modification times matches
the provided \code{Timestamp}. If the \code{Timestamp} values do not match, the
operation returns a \verb{412 Precondition Failed} error. If the \code{Timestamp}
matches or if the object doesn’t exist, the operation returns a
\verb{204 Success (No Content)} response.

This functionality is only supported for directory buckets.}

\item{IfMatchSize}{If present, the object is deleted only if its size matches the provided
size in bytes. If the \code{Size} value does not match, the operation returns
a \verb{412 Precondition Failed} error. If the \code{Size} matches or if the
object doesn’t exist, the operation returns a \verb{204 Success (No Content)}
response.

This functionality is only supported for directory buckets.

You can use the \code{If-Match}, \verb{x-amz-if-match-last-modified-time} and
\verb{x-amz-if-match-size} conditional headers in conjunction with each-other
or individually.}
