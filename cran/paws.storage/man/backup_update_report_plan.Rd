\item{ReportPlanDescription}{An optional description of the report plan with a maximum 1,024
characters.}

\item{ReportDeliveryChannel}{A structure that contains information about where to deliver your
reports, specifically your Amazon S3 bucket name, S3 key prefix, and the
formats of your reports.}

\item{ReportSetting}{Identifies the report template for the report. Reports are built using a
report template. The report templates are:

\code{RESOURCE_COMPLIANCE_REPORT | CONTROL_COMPLIANCE_REPORT | BACKUP_JOB_REPORT | COPY_JOB_REPORT | RESTORE_JOB_REPORT}

If the report template is \code{RESOURCE_COMPLIANCE_REPORT} or
\code{CONTROL_COMPLIANCE_REPORT}, this API resource also describes the report
coverage by Amazon Web Services Regions and frameworks.}

\item{IdempotencyToken}{A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between
otherwise identical calls to \code{UpdateReportPlanInput}. Retrying a
successful request with the same idempotency token results in a success
message with no action taken.}
