\title{Returns the default encryption configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket}
\usage{
s3_get_bucket_encryption(Bucket, ExpectedBucketOwner = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket from which the server-side encryption
configuration is retrieved.

\strong{Directory buckets} - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use path-style requests in the format
\verb{https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name }.
Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. Directory bucket names
must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone).
Bucket names must also follow the format
\code{ bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3} (for example,
\code{ DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3}). For information about bucket
naming restrictions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html}{Directory bucket naming rules}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails
with the HTTP status code \verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).

For directory buckets, this header is not supported in this API
operation. If you specify this header, the request fails with the HTTP
status code \verb{501 Not Implemented}.}
