\description{
Returns the current service opt-in settings for the Region. If service opt-in is enabled for a service, Backup tries to protect that service's resources in this Region, when the resource is included in an on-demand backup or scheduled backup plan. Otherwise, Backup does not try to protect that service's resources in this Region.
