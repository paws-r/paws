\usage{
s3_list_parts(Bucket, Key, MaxParts, PartNumberMarker, UploadId,
  RequestPayer, ExpectedBucketOwner)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket to which the parts are being uploaded.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.\emph{outpostID}.s3-outposts.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{Key}{[required] Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.}

\item{MaxParts}{Sets the maximum number of parts to return.}

\item{PartNumberMarker}{Specifies the part after which listing should begin. Only parts with
higher part numbers will be listed.}

\item{UploadId}{[required] Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose parts are being listed.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
\verb{403 (Access Denied)} error.}

\description{
Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload.
This operation must include the upload ID, which you obtain by sending
the initiate multipart upload request (see
\code{\link[=s3_create_multipart_upload]{create_multipart_upload}}). This request
returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The default number of parts
returned is 1,000 parts. You can restrict the number of parts returned
by specifying the \code{max-parts} request parameter. If your multipart
upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an
\code{IsTruncated} field with the value of true, and a \code{NextPartNumberMarker}
element. In subsequent \code{\link[=s3_list_parts]{list_parts}} requests you can
include the part-number-marker query string parameter and set its value
to the \code{NextPartNumberMarker} field value from the previous response.
