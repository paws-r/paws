\title{Returns metadata about all of the versions of objects in a bucket}
\usage{
s3_list_object_versions(Bucket, Delimiter, EncodingType, KeyMarker,
  MaxKeys, Prefix, VersionIdMarker)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name that contains the objects.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs,
you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{Delimiter}{A delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys that
contain the same string between the \code{prefix} and the first occurrence of
the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in
CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result against the
max-keys limitation. These keys are not returned elsewhere in the
response.}

\item{EncodingType}{}

\item{KeyMarker}{Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in a bucket.}

\item{MaxKeys}{Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. The response
might contain fewer keys but will never contain more. If additional keys
satisfy the search criteria, but were not returned because max-keys was
exceeded, the response contains \\<isTruncated\\>true\\</isTruncated\\>. To
return the additional keys, see key-marker and version-id-marker.}

\item{Prefix}{Use this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the
specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into
different groupings of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
groups in the same way you\'d use a folder in a file system.) You can
use prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a single
result under CommonPrefixes.}

\item{VersionIdMarker}{Specifies the object version you want to start listing from.}
}
\description{
Returns metadata about all of the versions of objects in a bucket. You
can also use request parameters as selection criteria to return metadata
about a subset of all the object versions.
}
\details{
A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid XML. Make sure to design
your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it
appropriately.

To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.
