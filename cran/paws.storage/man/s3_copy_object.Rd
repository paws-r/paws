\arguments{
\item{ACL}{The canned ACL to apply to the object.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the destination bucket.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.\emph{outpostID}.s3-outposts.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3onOutposts.html}{Using S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{CacheControl}{Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.}

\item{ContentDisposition}{Specifies presentational information for the object.}

\item{ContentEncoding}{Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
referenced by the Content-Type header field.}

\item{ContentLanguage}{The language the content is in.}

\item{ContentType}{A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.}

\item{CopySource}{[required] Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the
source object through an \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-points.html}{access point}:
\itemize{
\item For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by
a slash (/). For example, to copy the object \code{reports/january.pdf}
from the bucket \code{awsexamplebucket}, use
\code{awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf}. The value must be URL
encoded.
\item For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
point, in the format
\verb{arn:aws:s3:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:accesspoint/&lt;access-point-name&gt;/object/&lt;key&gt;}.
For example, to copy the object \code{reports/january.pdf} through access
point \code{my-access-point} owned by account \code{123456789012} in Region
\code{us-west-2}, use the URL encoding of
\code{arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf}.
The value must be URL encoded.

Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the
source and destination buckets are in the same AWS Region.

Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
\verb{arn:aws:s3-outposts:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:outpost/&lt;outpost-id&gt;/object/&lt;key&gt;}.
For example, to copy the object \code{reports/january.pdf} through
outpost \code{my-outpost} owned by account \code{123456789012} in Region
\code{us-west-2}, use the URL encoding of
\code{arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf}.
The value must be URL encoded.
}

To copy a specific version of an object, append
\verb{?versionId=&lt;version-id&gt;} to the value (for example,
\code{awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893}).
If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version
of the source object.}

\item{CopySourceIfMatch}{Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.}

\item{CopySourceIfModifiedSince}{Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.}

\item{CopySourceIfNoneMatch}{Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the
specified ETag.}

\item{CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince}{Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.}

\item{Expires}{The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.}

\item{GrantFullControl}{Gives the grantee READ, READ\\_ACP, and WRITE\\_ACP permissions on the
object.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantRead}{Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantReadACP}{Allows grantee to read the object ACL.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantWriteACP}{Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{Key}{[required] The key of the destination object.}

\item{Metadata}{A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.}

\item{MetadataDirective}{Specifies whether the metadata is copied from the source object or
replaced with metadata provided in the request.}

\item{TaggingDirective}{Specifies whether the object tag-set are copied from the source object
or replaced with tag-set provided in the request.}

\item{ServerSideEncryption}{The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).}

\item{StorageClass}{By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
Storage Class. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html}{Storage Classes}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{WebsiteRedirectLocation}{If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
example, AES256).}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm} header.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.}

\item{SSEKMSKeyId}{Specifies the AWS KMS key ID to use for object encryption. All GET and
PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS will fail if not made
via SSL or using SigV4. For information about configuring using any of
the officially supported AWS SDKs and AWS CLI, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version}{Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Developer Guide}.}

\item{SSEKMSEncryptionContext}{Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption.
The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
with the encryption context key-value pairs.}

\item{BucketKeyEnabled}{Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting
this header to \code{true} causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for
object encryption with SSE-KMS.

Specifying this header with a COPY operation doesnâ€™t affect bucket-level
settings for S3 Bucket Key.}

\item{CopySourceSSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for
example, AES256).}

\item{CopySourceSSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to
decrypt the source object. The encryption key provided in this header
must be one that was used when the source object was created.}

\item{CopySourceSSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{Tagging}{The tag-set for the object destination object this value must be used in
conjunction with the \code{TaggingDirective}. The tag-set must be encoded as
URL Query parameters.}

\item{ObjectLockMode}{The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the copied object.}

\item{ObjectLockRetainUntilDate}{The date and time when you want the copied object's Object Lock to
expire.}

\item{ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus}{Specifies whether you want to apply a Legal Hold to the copied object.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account id of the expected destination bucket owner. If the
destination bucket is owned by a different account, the request will
fail with an HTTP \verb{403 (Access Denied)} error.}

\item{ExpectedSourceBucketOwner}{The account id of the expected source bucket owner. If the source bucket
is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
\verb{403 (Access Denied)} error.}
}
\description{
Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create
a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation
using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must
use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html}{Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API}.

All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have
\emph{read} access to the source object and \emph{write} access to the destination
bucket. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html}{REST Authentication}.
Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region
that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.

A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy
request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs
before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3
error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response
is embedded in the \verb{200 OK} response. This means that a \verb{200 OK}
response can contain either a success or an error. Design your
application to parse the contents of the response and handle it
appropriately.

If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about
the copied object.

If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If
it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need
to read the entire body.

The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that
you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/}{Amazon S3 pricing}.

Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If
you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint,
you get a 400 \verb{Bad Request} error. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html}{Transfer Acceleration}.

\strong{Metadata}

When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or
specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to
private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL
setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html}{Using ACLs}.

To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source
object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can
optionally add the \code{x-amz-metadata-directive} header. When you grant
permissions, you can use the \code{s3:x-amz-metadata-directive} condition key
to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html}{Specifying Conditions in a Policy}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Developer Guide}. For a complete list of Amazon
S3-specific condition keys, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html}{Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3}.

\strong{\verb{x-amz-copy-source-if} Headers}

To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the
\code{Etag} matches or whether the object was modified before or after a
specified date, use the following request parameters:
\itemize{
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-match}
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match}
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since}
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since}
}

If both the \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-match} and
\verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since} headers are present in the
request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns \verb{200 OK} and copies
the data:
\itemize{
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-match} condition evaluates to true
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since} condition evaluates to false
}

If both the \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match} and
\verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since} headers are present in the request
and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the \verb{412 Precondition Failed}
response code:
\itemize{
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match} condition evaluates to false
\item \verb{x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since} condition evaluates to true
}

All headers with the \verb{x-amz-} prefix, including \code{x-amz-copy-source},
must be signed.

\strong{Server-side encryption}

When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the
appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using
server-side encryption with AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or
SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side
encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more
information about server-side encryption, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html}{Using Server-Side Encryption}.

If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the
object. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html}{Amazon S3 Bucket Keys}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

\strong{Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers}

When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant
ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the
owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant
permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html}{Access Control List (ACL) Overview}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html}{Managing ACLs Using the REST API}.

\strong{Storage Class Options}

You can use the \code{CopyObject} operation to change the storage class of an
object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the \code{StorageClass}
parameter. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html}{Storage Classes}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide}.

\strong{Versioning}

By default, \code{x-amz-copy-source} identifies the current version of an
object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3
behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use
the \code{versionId} subresource.

If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a
unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is
different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns
the version ID of the copied object in the \code{x-amz-version-id} response
header in the response.

If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the
version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.

If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy
of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy
operation. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html}{RestoreObject}.

The following operations are related to \code{CopyObject}:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html}{PutObject}
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html}{GetObject}
}

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html}{Copying Objects}.
