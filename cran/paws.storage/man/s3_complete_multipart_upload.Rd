\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using Amazon S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{Key}{[required] Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.}

\item{MultipartUpload}{The container for the multipart upload request information.}

\item{UploadId}{[required] ID for the initiated multipart upload.}

\item{ChecksumCRC32}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32 checksum of the object. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumCRC32C}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32C checksum of the object. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumSHA1}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the base64-encoded, 160-bit SHA-1 digest of the object. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ChecksumSHA256}{This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the base64-encoded, 256-bit SHA-256 digest of the object. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
\verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{The server-side encryption (SSE) algorithm used to encrypt the object.
This parameter is needed only when the object was created using a
checksum algorithm. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html}{Protecting data using SSE-C keys}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{The server-side encryption (SSE) customer managed key. This parameter is
needed only when the object was created using a checksum algorithm. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html}{Protecting data using SSE-C keys}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{The MD5 server-side encryption (SSE) customer managed key. This
parameter is needed only when the object was created using a checksum
algorithm. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html}{Protecting data using SSE-C keys}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}
