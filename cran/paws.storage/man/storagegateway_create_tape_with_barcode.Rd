\usage{
storagegateway_create_tape_with_barcode(GatewayARN, TapeSizeInBytes,
  TapeBarcode, KMSEncrypted, KMSKey, PoolId, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{GatewayARN}{[required] The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that represents the gateway to
associate the virtual tape with. Use the ListGateways operation to
return a list of gateways for your account and AWS Region.}

\item{TapeSizeInBytes}{[required] The size, in bytes, of the virtual tape that you want to create.

The size must be aligned by gigabyte (1024\emph{1024}1024 byte).}

\item{TapeBarcode}{[required] The barcode that you want to assign to the tape.

Barcodes cannot be reused. This includes barcodes used for tapes that
have been deleted.}

\item{KMSEncrypted}{True to use Amazon S3 server side encryption with your own AWS KMS key,
or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.}

\item{KMSKey}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS KMS Key used for Amazon S3
server side encryption. This value can only be set when KMSEncrypted is
true. Optional.}

\item{PoolId}{The ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for archiving. The
tape in this pool is archived in the S3 storage class that is associated
with the pool. When you use your backup application to eject the tape,
the tape is archived directly into the storage class (Glacier or Deep
Archive) that corresponds to the pool.

Valid values: \"GLACIER\", \"DEEP\\_ARCHIVE\"}

\item{Tags}{A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to a virtual tape that has
a barcode. Each tag is a key-value pair.

Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers
representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + -
= . \\_ : / @. The maximum length of a tag\'s key is 128 characters, and
the maximum length for a tag\'s value is 256.}
}
\description{
Creates a virtual tape by using your own barcode. You write data to the
virtual tape and then archive the tape. A barcode is unique and can not
be reused if it has already been used on a tape . This applies to
barcodes used on deleted tapes. This operation is only supported in the
tape gateway type.
}
\details{
Cache storage must be allocated to the gateway before you can create a
virtual tape. Use the AddCache operation to add cache storage to a
gateway.
