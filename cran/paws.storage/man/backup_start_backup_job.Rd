backup_start_backup_job(
  BackupVaultName,
  ResourceArn,
  IamRoleArn,

  StartWindowMinutes = NULL,
  CompleteWindowMinutes = NULL,
  Lifecycle = NULL,
  RecoveryPointTags = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{BackupVaultName}{[required] The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults
are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create
them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created.}

\item{ResourceArn}{[required] An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The
format of the ARN depends on the resource type.}

\item{IamRoleArn}{[required] Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for
example, \verb{arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access}.}

\item{IdempotencyToken}{A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between
otherwise identical calls to
\code{\link[=backup_start_backup_job]{start_backup_job}}. Retrying a successful
request with the same idempotency token results in a success message
with no action taken.}

\item{StartWindowMinutes}{A value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be
canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value is optional, and
the default is 8 hours. If this value is included, it must be at least
60 minutes to avoid errors.

This parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (52,560,000 minutes).

During the start window, the backup job status remains in \code{CREATED}
status until it has successfully begun or until the start window time
has run out. If within the start window time Backup receives an error
that allows the job to be retried, Backup will automatically retry to
begin the job at least every 10 minutes until the backup successfully
begins (the job status changes to \code{RUNNING}) or until the job status
changes to \code{EXPIRED} (which is expected to occur when the start window
time is over).}

\item{CompleteWindowMinutes}{A value in minutes during which a successfully started backup must
complete, or else Backup will cancel the job. This value is optional.
This value begins counting down from when the backup was scheduled. It
does not add additional time for \code{StartWindowMinutes}, or if the backup
started later than scheduled.

Like \code{StartWindowMinutes}, this parameter has a maximum value of 100
years (52,560,000 minutes).}

\item{Lifecycle}{The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold
storage and when it expires. Backup will transition and expire backups
automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for
a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days
greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The
“transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup
has been transitioned to cold.

Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource}{Feature availability by resource}
table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

This parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (36,500 days).}

\item{RecoveryPointTags}{The tags to assign to the resources.}

\item{BackupOptions}{The backup option for a selected resource. This option is only available
for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup jobs.

Valid values: Set to \code{"WindowsVSS":"enabled"} to enable the \code{WindowsVSS}
backup option and create a Windows VSS backup. Set to
\verb{"WindowsVSS""disabled"} to create a regular backup. The \code{WindowsVSS}
option is not enabled by default.}

\item{Index}{Include this parameter to enable index creation if your backup job has a
resource type that supports backup indexes.

Resource types that support backup indexes include:
\itemize{
\item \code{EBS} for Amazon Elastic Block Store
\item \code{S3} for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
}

Index can have 1 of 2 possible values, either \code{ENABLED} or \code{DISABLED}.

To create a backup index for an eligible \code{ACTIVE} recovery point that
does not yet have a backup index, set value to \code{ENABLED}.

To delete a backup index, set value to \code{DISABLED}.}
