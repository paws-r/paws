  Bucket,
  Key,

\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name that contains the object you want to apply this Object
Retention configuration to.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{Key}{[required] The key name for the object that you want to apply this Object Retention
configuration to.}

\item{Retention}{The container element for the Object Retention configuration.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{VersionId}{The version ID for the object that you want to apply this Object
Retention configuration to.}

\item{BypassGovernanceRetention}{Indicates whether this action should bypass Governance-mode
restrictions.}

\item{ContentMD5}{The MD5 hash for the request body.

For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface
(CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated
automatically.}

\item{ChecksumAlgorithm}{Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when
using the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality
if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there must be a
corresponding \code{x-amz-checksum} or \code{x-amz-trailer} header sent.
Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code
\verb{400 Bad Request}. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided
\code{ChecksumAlgorithm} parameter.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
\verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}
}
\description{
Places an Object Retention configuration on an object. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html}{Locking Objects}. Users or accounts require the \code{s3:PutObjectRetention} permission in order to place an Object Retention configuration on objects. Bypassing a Governance Retention configuration requires the \code{s3:BypassGovernanceRetention} permission.
