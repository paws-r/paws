\title{This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads}
\usage{
s3_list_multipart_uploads(Bucket, Delimiter, EncodingType, KeyMarker,
  MaxUploads, Prefix, UploadIdMarker, ExpectedBucketOwner)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.\emph{outpostID}.s3-outposts.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3onOutposts.html}{Using S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{Delimiter}{Character you use to group keys.

All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified,
and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are grouped
under a single result element, \code{CommonPrefixes}. If you don't specify
the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the beginning of the
key. The keys that are grouped under \code{CommonPrefixes} result element are
not returned elsewhere in the response.}

\item{EncodingType}{}

\item{KeyMarker}{Together with upload-id-marker, this parameter specifies the multipart
upload after which listing should begin.

If \code{upload-id-marker} is not specified, only the keys lexicographically
greater than the specified \code{key-marker} will be included in the list.

If \code{upload-id-marker} is specified, any multipart uploads for a key
equal to the \code{key-marker} might also be included, provided those
multipart uploads have upload IDs lexicographically greater than the
specified \code{upload-id-marker}.}

\item{MaxUploads}{Sets the maximum number of multipart uploads, from 1 to 1,000, to return
in the response body. 1,000 is the maximum number of uploads that can be
returned in a response.}

\item{Prefix}{Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the
specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into
different grouping of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)}

\item{UploadIdMarker}{Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which
listing should begin. If key-marker is not specified, the
upload-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise, any multipart uploads
for a key equal to the key-marker might be included in the list only if
they have an upload ID lexicographically greater than the specified
\code{upload-id-marker}.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account id of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request will fail with an HTTP
\verb{403 (Access Denied)} error.}
}
\description{
This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress
multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated using the
Initiate Multipart Upload request, but has not yet been completed or
aborted.

This operation returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the response.
1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can
include, which is also the default value. You can further limit the
number of uploads in a response by specifying the \code{max-uploads}
parameter in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the
list criteria, the response will contain an \code{IsTruncated} element with
the value true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the
\code{key-marker} and \code{upload-id-marker} request parameters.

In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has
initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then
uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads
are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation
time.
