\title{Returns the replication configuration of a bucket}
\usage{
s3_get_bucket_replication(Bucket)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name for which to get the replication information.}
}
\description{
Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.
}
\details{
It can take a while to propagate the put or delete a replication
configuration to all Amazon S3 systems. Therefore, a get request soon
after put or delete can return a wrong result.

For information about replication configuration, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html}{Replication}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

This operation requires permissions for the
\code{s3:GetReplicationConfiguration} action. For more information about
permissions, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html}{Using Bucket Policies and User Policies}.

If you include the \code{Filter} element in a replication configuration, you
must also include the \code{DeleteMarkerReplication} and \code{Priority} elements.
The response also returns those elements.

For information about \code{GetBucketReplication} errors, see
