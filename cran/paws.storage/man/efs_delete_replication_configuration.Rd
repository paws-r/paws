\description{
Deletes an existing replication configuration. To delete a replication configuration, you must make the request from the Amazon Web Services Region in which the destination file system is located. Deleting a replication configuration ends the replication process. After a replication configuration is deleted, the destination file system is no longer read-only. You can write to the destination file system after its status becomes \code{Writeable}.
