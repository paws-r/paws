\title{Use this action to associate one or more Domain Name Server (DNS)
aliases with an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system}
\usage{
fsx_associate_file_system_aliases(
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  FileSystemId,
  Aliases
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ClientRequestToken}{}

\item{FileSystemId}{[required] Specifies the file system with which you want to associate one or more
DNS aliases.}

\item{Aliases}{[required] An array of one or more DNS alias names to associate with the file
system. The alias name has to comply with the following formatting
requirements:
\itemize{
\item Formatted as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), \emph{hostname.domain}
, for example, \code{accounting.corp.example.com}.
\item Can contain alphanumeric characters and the hyphen (-).
\item Cannot start or end with a hyphen.
\item Can start with a numeric.
}

For DNS alias names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as
lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as
uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters in
escape codes.}
}
\description{
Use this action to associate one or more Domain Name Server (DNS) aliases with an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. A file system can have a maximum of 50 DNS aliases associated with it at any one time. If you try to associate a DNS alias that is already associated with the file system, FSx takes no action on that alias in the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html}{Working with DNS Aliases} and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/walkthrough05-file-system-custom-CNAME.html}{Walkthrough 5: Using DNS aliases to access your file system}, including additional steps you must take to be able to access your file system using a DNS alias.
