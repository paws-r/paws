successful request with the same idempotency token results in a success
message with no action taken.}

\description{
Creates a framework with one or more controls. A framework is a collection of controls that you can use to evaluate your backup practices. By using pre-built customizable controls to define your policies, you can evaluate whether your backup practices comply with your policies and which resources are not yet in compliance.
