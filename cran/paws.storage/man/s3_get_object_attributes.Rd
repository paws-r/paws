\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket that contains the object.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using access points}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
takes the form
\code{ AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com}.
When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the
bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using Amazon S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{Key}{[required] The object key.}

\item{VersionId}{The version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.}

\item{MaxParts}{Sets the maximum number of parts to return.}

\item{PartNumberMarker}{Specifies the part after which listing should begin. Only parts with
higher part numbers will be listed.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example,
AES256).}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm} header.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
\verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}

\item{ObjectAttributes}{[required] An XML header that specifies the fields at the root level that you want
returned in the response. Fields that you do not specify are not
returned.}
}
\description{
Retrieves all the metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This action is useful if you're interested only in an object's metadata. To use \code{\link[=s3_get_object_attributes]{get_object_attributes}}, you must have READ access to the object.

See \url{https://paws-r.github.io/docs/s3/get_object_attributes.html} for full documentation.
