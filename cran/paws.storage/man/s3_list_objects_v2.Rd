\title{Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket}
\usage{
s3_list_objects_v2(Bucket, Delimiter, EncodingType, MaxKeys, Prefix,
  ContinuationToken, FetchOwner, StartAfter, RequestPayer)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] Bucket name to list.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs,
you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{Delimiter}{A delimiter is a character you use to group keys.}

\item{EncodingType}{Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object keys in the response.}

\item{MaxKeys}{Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. The response
might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.}

\item{Prefix}{Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.}

\item{ContinuationToken}{ContinuationToken indicates Amazon S3 that the list is being continued
on this bucket with a token. ContinuationToken is obfuscated and is not
a real key.}

\item{FetchOwner}{The owner field is not present in listV2 by default, if you want to
return owner field with each key in the result then set the fetch owner
field to true.}

\item{StartAfter}{StartAfter is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon S3
starts listing after this specified key. StartAfter can be any key in
the bucket.}

\item{RequestPayer}{Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the
list objects request in V2 style. Bucket owners need not specify this
parameter in their requests.}
}
\description{
Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket. You can
use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of
the objects in a bucket. A \verb{200 OK} response can contain valid or
invalid XML. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents
of the response and handle it appropriately.
}
\details{
To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.

To use this operation in an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
policy, you must have permissions to perform the \code{s3:ListBucket} action.
The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this
permission to others. For more information about permissions, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources}{Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html}{Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources}.

This section describes the latest revision of the API. We recommend that
you use this revised API for application development. For backward
compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the prior version of this
API, ListObjects.

To get a list of your buckets, see ListBuckets.

The following operations are related to \code{ListObjectsV2}:
\itemize{
\item GetObject
\item PutObject
\item CreateBucket
