\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name containing the object.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs,
you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{IfMatch}{Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the one
specified, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).}

\item{IfModifiedSince}{Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time,
otherwise return a 304 (not modified).}

\item{IfNoneMatch}{Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from the
one specified, otherwise return a 304 (not modified).}

\item{IfUnmodifiedSince}{Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified
time, otherwise return a 412 (precondition failed).}

\item{Key}{[required] Key of the object to get.}

\item{Range}{Downloads the specified range bytes of an object. For more information
about the HTTP Range header, see
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html\\#sec14.35.}

\item{ResponseCacheControl}{Sets the \code{Cache-Control} header of the response.}

\item{ResponseContentDisposition}{Sets the \code{Content-Disposition} header of the response}

\item{ResponseContentEncoding}{Sets the \code{Content-Encoding} header of the response.}

\item{ResponseContentLanguage}{Sets the \code{Content-Language} header of the response.}

\item{ResponseContentType}{Sets the \code{Content-Type} header of the response.}

\item{ResponseExpires}{Sets the \code{Expires} header of the response.}

\item{VersionId}{VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
example, AES256).}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\verb{x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-algorithm} header.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{PartNumber}{Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between
1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a \'ranged\' GET request for the part
specified. Useful for downloading just a part of an object.}
}
\description{
Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use \code{GET}, you must have \code{READ}
access to the object. If you grant \code{READ} access to the anonymous user,
you can return the object without using an authorization header.
}
\details{
An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in
a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical
hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For
example, instead of naming an object \code{sample.jpg}, you can name it
\code{photos/2006/February/sample.jpg}.

To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key
name for the object in the \code{GET} operation. For a virtual hosted-style
request example, if you have the object
\code{photos/2006/February/sample.jpg}, specify the resource as
\verb{/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg}. For a path-style request example, if
you have the object \code{photos/2006/February/sample.jpg} in the bucket
named \code{examplebucket}, specify the resource as
\verb{/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg}. For more information
about request types, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket}{HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification}.

To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs
by using BitTorrent. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html}{Amazon S3 Torrent}.
For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see
GetObjectAcl.

If the object you are retrieving is stored in the GLACIER or
DEEP\\_ARCHIVE storage classes, before you can retrieve the object you
must first restore a copy using . Otherwise, this operation returns an
\code{InvalidObjectStateError} error. For information about restoring
archived objects, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html}{Restoring Archived Objects}.

Encryption request headers, like \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption}, should
not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption
with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with
Amazon S3--managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use
these types of keys, you'll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with
customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in
Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following
headers:
\itemize{
\item x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-algorithm
\item x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key
\item x-amz-server-sideâ€‹-encryptionâ€‹-customer-key-MD5
}

For more information about SSE-C, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html}{Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)}.

Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the
\code{s3:GetObjectVersionTagging} action), the response also returns the
\code{x-amz-tagging-count} header that provides the count of number of tags
associated with the object. You can use GetObjectTagging to retrieve the
tag set associated with an object.

\strong{Permissions}

You need the \code{s3:GetObject} permission for this operation. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html}{Specifying Permissions in a Policy}.
If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns
depends on whether you also have the \code{s3:ListBucket} permission.
\itemize{
\item If you have the \code{s3:ListBucket} permission on the bucket, Amazon S3
will return an HTTP status code 404 (\"no such key\") error.
\item If you don't have the \code{s3:ListBucket} permission, Amazon S3 will
return an HTTP status code 403 (\"access denied\") error.
}

\strong{Versioning}

By default, the GET operation returns the current version of an object.
To return a different version, use the \code{versionId} subresource.

If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3
behaves as if the object was deleted and includes
\code{x-amz-delete-marker: true} in the response.

For more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning.

\strong{Overriding Response Header Values}

There are times when you want to override certain response header values
in a GET response. For example, you might override the
Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request.

You can override values for a set of response headers using the
following query parameters. These response header values are sent only
on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned.
The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset
of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The
response headers that you can override for the GET response are
\code{Content-Type}, \code{Content-Language}, \code{Expires}, \code{Cache-Control},
\code{Content-Disposition}, and \code{Content-Encoding}. To override these header
values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.

You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a
presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an
unsigned (anonymous) request.
\itemize{
\item \code{response-content-type}
\item \code{response-content-language}
\item \code{response-expires}
\item \code{response-cache-control}
\item \code{response-content-disposition}
\item \code{response-content-encoding}
}

\strong{Additional Considerations about Request Headers}

If both of the \code{If-Match} and \code{If-Unmodified-Since} headers are present
in the request as follows: \code{If-Match} condition evaluates to \code{true},
and; \code{If-Unmodified-Since} condition evaluates to \code{false}; then, S3
returns 200 OK and the data requested.

If both of the \code{If-None-Match} and \code{If-Modified-Since} headers are
present in the request as follows:\code{ If-None-Match} condition evaluates
to \code{false}, and; \code{If-Modified-Since} condition evaluates to \code{true};
then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.

For more information about conditional requests, see \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232}{RFC 7232}.
