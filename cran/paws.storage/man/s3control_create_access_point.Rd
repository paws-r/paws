\usage{
s3control_create_access_point(
  AccountId,
  Name,
  Bucket,
  VpcConfiguration = NULL,
  PublicAccessBlockConfiguration = NULL,
  BucketAccountId = NULL,
  Scope = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{AccountId}{[required] The Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that owns the
specified access point.}

\item{Name}{[required] The name you want to assign to this access point.

For directory buckets, the access point name must consist of a base name
that you provide and suffix that includes the \code{ZoneID} (Amazon Web
Services Availability Zone or Local Zone) of your bucket location,
followed by \code{--xa-s3}. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-directory-buckets.html}{Managing access to shared datasets in directory buckets with access points}
in the Amazon S3 User Guide.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket that you want to associate this access point
with.

For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API,
you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in
the format
\verb{arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>}.
For example, to access the bucket \code{reports} through Outpost \code{my-outpost}
owned by account \code{123456789012} in Region \code{us-west-2}, use the URL
encoding of
\code{arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports}.
The value must be URL encoded.}

\item{VpcConfiguration}{If you include this field, Amazon S3 restricts access to this access
point to requests from the specified virtual private cloud (VPC).

This is required for creating an access point for Amazon S3 on Outposts
buckets.}

\item{PublicAccessBlockConfiguration}{The \code{PublicAccessBlock} configuration that you want to apply to the
access point.}

\item{BucketAccountId}{The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the S3 bucket
associated with this access point.

For same account access point when your bucket and access point belong
to the same account owner, the \code{BucketAccountId} is not required. For
cross-account access point when your bucket and access point are not in
the same account, the \code{BucketAccountId} is required.}

\item{Scope}{For directory buckets, you can filter access control to specific
prefixes, API operations, or a combination of both. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-directory-buckets.html}{Managing access to shared datasets in directory buckets with access points}
in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Scope is not supported for access points for general purpose buckets.}
