\title{Returns a list of the access points currently associated with the
specified bucket}
\usage{
s3control_list_access_points(
  AccountId,
  Bucket = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{AccountId}{[required] The Amazon Web Services account ID for owner of the bucket whose access
points you want to list.}

\item{Bucket}{The name of the bucket whose associated access points you want to list.

For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API,
you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in
the format
\verb{arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>}.
For example, to access the bucket \code{reports} through outpost \code{my-outpost}
owned by account \code{123456789012} in Region \code{us-west-2}, use the URL
encoding of
\code{arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports}.
The value must be URL encoded.}

\item{NextToken}{A continuation token. If a previous call to
\code{\link[=s3control_list_access_points]{list_access_points}} returned a
continuation token in the \code{NextToken} field, then providing that value
here causes Amazon S3 to retrieve the next page of results.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of access points that you want to include in the
list. If the specified bucket has more than this number of access
points, then the response will include a continuation token in the
\code{NextToken} field that you can use to retrieve the next page of access
points.}
}
\description{
Returns a list of the access points currently associated with the specified bucket. You can retrieve up to 1000 access points per call. If the specified bucket has more than 1,000 access points (or the number specified in \code{maxResults}, whichever is less), the response will include a continuation token that you can use to list the additional access points.
