\title{Use this operation to update the configuration of an existing Amazon FSx
file system}
\usage{
fsx_update_file_system(
  FileSystemId,
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  StorageCapacity = NULL,
  WindowsConfiguration = NULL,
  LustreConfiguration = NULL,
  OntapConfiguration = NULL,
  OpenZFSConfiguration = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{FileSystemId}{[required] The ID of the file system that you are updating.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure
idempotent updates. This string is automatically filled on your behalf
when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon Web Services
SDK.}

\item{StorageCapacity}{Use this parameter to increase the storage capacity of an Amazon FSx for
Windows File Server, Amazon FSx for Lustre, or Amazon FSx for NetApp
ONTAP file system. Specifies the storage capacity target value, in GiB,
to increase the storage capacity for the file system that you're
updating.

You can't make a storage capacity increase request if there is an
existing storage capacity increase request in progress.

For Windows file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at
least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value. To
increase storage capacity, the file system must have at least 16 MBps of
throughput capacity. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html}{Managing storage capacity}
in the \emph{Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide}.

For Lustre file systems, the storage capacity target value can be the
following:
\itemize{
\item For \code{SCRATCH_2}, \code{PERSISTENT_1}, and \verb{PERSISTENT_2 SSD} deployment
types, valid values are in multiples of 2400 GiB. The value must be
greater than the current storage capacity.
\item For \verb{PERSISTENT HDD} file systems, valid values are multiples of
6000 GiB for 12-MBps throughput per TiB file systems and multiples
of 1800 GiB for 40-MBps throughput per TiB file systems. The values
must be greater than the current storage capacity.
\item For \code{SCRATCH_1} file systems, you can't increase the storage
capacity.
}

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html}{Managing storage and throughput capacity}
in the \emph{Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide}.

For ONTAP file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at
least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html}{Managing storage capacity and provisioned IOPS}
in the \emph{Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide}.}

\item{WindowsConfiguration}{The configuration updates for an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file
system.}

\item{LustreConfiguration}{}

\item{OntapConfiguration}{}

\item{OpenZFSConfiguration}{The configuration updates for an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.}
}
