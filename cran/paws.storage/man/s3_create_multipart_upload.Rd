\arguments{
\item{ACL}{The canned ACL to apply to the object.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the bucket to which to initiate the upload

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.

When using this API with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests
to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.\emph{outpostID}.s3-outposts.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using S3 on Outposts through the AWS SDKs, you
provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html}{Using S3 on Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{CacheControl}{Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.}

\item{ContentDisposition}{Specifies presentational information for the object.}

\item{ContentEncoding}{Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
referenced by the Content-Type header field.}

\item{ContentLanguage}{The language the content is in.}

\item{ContentType}{A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.}

\item{Expires}{The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.}

\item{GrantFullControl}{Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the
object.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantRead}{Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantReadACP}{Allows grantee to read the object ACL.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{GrantWriteACP}{Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.}

\item{Key}{[required] Object key for which the multipart upload is to be initiated.}

\item{Metadata}{A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.}

\item{ServerSideEncryption}{The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).}

\item{StorageClass}{By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
Storage Class. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html}{Storage Classes}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{WebsiteRedirectLocation}{If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.}

\item{SSECustomerAlgorithm}{Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
example, AES256).}

\item{SSECustomerKey}{Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
\code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm} header.}

\item{SSECustomerKeyMD5}{Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
that the encryption key was transmitted without error.}

\item{SSEKMSKeyId}{Specifies the ID of the symmetric customer managed AWS KMS CMK to use
for object encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an object protected
by AWS KMS will fail if not made via SSL or using SigV4. For information
about configuring using any of the officially supported AWS SDKs and AWS
CLI, see Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication in
the \emph{Amazon S3 Developer Guide}.}

\item{SSEKMSEncryptionContext}{Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption.
The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
with the encryption context key-value pairs.}

\item{BucketKeyEnabled}{Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting
this header to \code{true} causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for
object encryption with SSE-KMS.

Specifying this header with an object operation doesnâ€™t affect
bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.}

\item{RequestPayer}{}

\item{Tagging}{The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
parameters.}

\description{
This operation initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID.
This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific
multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent
upload part requests (see \code{\link[=s3_upload_part]{upload_part}}). You also
include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort
the multipart upload request.

For more information about multipart uploads, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html}{Multipart Upload Overview}.

If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart
uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in
the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart
upload becomes eligible for an abort operation and Amazon S3 aborts the
multipart upload. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config}{Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy}.

For information about the permissions required to use the multipart
upload API, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html}{Multipart Upload API and Permissions}.

For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular
requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to
upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign
each request individually. There is nothing special about signing
multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html}{Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)}.

After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to
stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either
complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space
used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only
after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.

You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side
encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your
own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer
master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose
to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in
\code{\link[=s3_upload_part]{upload_part}} and
\code{\link[=s3_upload_part_copy]{upload_part_copy}} requests must match the
headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using
\code{\link[=s3_create_multipart_upload]{create_multipart_upload}}.

To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the
requester must have permission to the \code{kms:Encrypt}, \code{kms:Decrypt},
\verb{kms:ReEncrypt*}, \verb{kms:GenerateDataKey*}, and \code{kms:DescribeKey} actions
on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must
decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes
the multipart upload.

If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the
same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these
permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a
different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on
both the key policy and your IAM user or role.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html}{Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption}.
\subsection{Access Permissions}{

When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or
groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object.
There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:
\itemize{
\item Specify a canned ACL with the \code{x-amz-acl} request header. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#CannedACL}{Canned ACL}.
\item Specify access permissions explicitly with the \code{x-amz-grant-read},
\code{x-amz-grant-read-acp}, \code{x-amz-grant-write-acp}, and
\code{x-amz-grant-full-control} headers. These parameters map to the set
of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html}{Access Control List (ACL) Overview}.
}

You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
explicitly. You cannot do both.
}

\subsection{Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers}{

You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using
server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data
centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends
on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your
own encryption key.
\itemize{
\item Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys
(CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) â€“ If you want
AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following
headers in the request.
\itemize{
\item x-amz-server-side-encryption
\item x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id
\item x-amz-server-side-encryption-context
}

If you specify \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms}, but don't
provide \code{x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id}, Amazon S3
uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.

All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if
you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.

For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored
in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html}{Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS}.
\item Use customer-provided encryption keys â€“ If you want to manage your
own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the
request.
\itemize{
\item x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
\item x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
\item x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
}

For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored
in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html}{Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS}.
}
}

\subsection{Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers}{

You also can use the following access controlâ€“related headers with this
operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full
access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to
individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3.
These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the
object. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl_overview.html}{Using ACLs}.
With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the
following two methods:
\itemize{
\item Specify a canned ACL (\code{x-amz-acl}) â€” Amazon S3 supports a set of
predefined ACLs, known as \emph{canned ACLs}. Each canned ACL has a
predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#CannedACL}{Canned ACL}.
\item Specify access permissions explicitly â€” To explicitly grant access
permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following
headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3
supports in an ACL. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html}{Access Control List (ACL) Overview}.
In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific
permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:
\itemize{
\item x-amz-grant-read
\item x-amz-grant-write
\item x-amz-grant-read-acp
\item x-amz-grant-write-acp
\item x-amz-grant-full-control
}

You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one
of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{id} â€“ if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS
account
\item \code{uri} â€“ if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
\item \code{emailAddress} â€“ if the value specified is the email address of
an AWS account

Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in
the following AWS Regions:
\itemize{
\item US East (N. Virginia)
\item US West (N. California)
\item US West (Oregon)
\item Asia Pacific (Singapore)
\item Asia Pacific (Sydney)
\item Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
\item Europe (Ireland)
\item South America (SÃ£o Paulo)
}

For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region}{Regions and Endpoints}
in the AWS General Reference.
}

For example, the following \code{x-amz-grant-read} header grants the AWS
accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data
and its metadata:

\verb{x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" }
}
