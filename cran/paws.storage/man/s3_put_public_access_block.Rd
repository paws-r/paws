\usage{
s3_put_public_access_block(
  Bucket,
  ContentMD5 = NULL,
  ChecksumAlgorithm = NULL,
  PublicAccessBlockConfiguration,
  ExpectedBucketOwner = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose \code{PublicAccessBlock} configuration
you want to set.}

\item{ContentMD5}{The MD5 hash of the
\code{\link[=s3_put_public_access_block]{put_public_access_block}} request body.

For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface
(CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated
automatically.}

\item{ChecksumAlgorithm}{Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when
you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional
functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there
must be a corresponding \code{x-amz-checksum} or \code{x-amz-trailer} header sent.
Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code
\verb{400 Bad Request}. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html}{Checking object integrity}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided
\code{ChecksumAlgorithm} parameter.}

\item{PublicAccessBlockConfiguration}{[required] The \code{PublicAccessBlock} configuration that you want to apply to this
Amazon S3 bucket. You can enable the configuration options in any
combination. For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a
bucket or object public, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status}{The Meaning of "Public"}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 User Guide}.}

\item{ExpectedBucketOwner}{The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails
with the HTTP status code \verb{403 Forbidden} (access denied).}
