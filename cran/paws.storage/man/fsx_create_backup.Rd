\title{Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx file system}
\usage{
fsx_create_backup(FileSystemId, ClientRequestToken, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{FileSystemId}{[required] The ID of the file system to back up.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{(Optional) A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to
ensure idempotent creation. This string is automatically filled on your
behalf when you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or an AWS
SDK.}

\item{Tags}{(Optional) The tags to apply to the backup at backup creation. The key
value of the \code{Name} tag appears in the console as the backup name. If
you have set \code{CopyTagsToBackups} to true, and you specify one or more
tags using the \code{\link[=fsx_create_backup]{create_backup}} action, no existing
file system tags are copied from the file system to the backup.}
}
\description{
Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx file system. Creating regular
backups for your file system is a best practice, enabling you to restore
a file system from a backup if an issue arises with the original file
system.

For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for
file systems with the following configuration:
\itemize{
\item a Persistent deployment type
\item is \emph{not} linked to a data respository.
}

For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Lustre file
systems, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html}{Working with FSx for Lustre backups}.

For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Windows file
systems, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html}{Working with FSx for Windows backups}.

If a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the
parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing
backup. If a backup specified client request token exists, and the
parameters don't match, this operation returns
\code{IncompatibleParameterError}. If a backup with the specified client
request token doesn't exist, \code{\link[=fsx_create_backup]{create_backup}} does
the following:
\itemize{
\item Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial
lifecycle state of \code{CREATING}.
\item Returns the description of the backup.
}

By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a
\code{\link[=fsx_create_backup]{create_backup}} operation without the risk of
creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when an initial
call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was created.
If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a
backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the
parameters are the same.

The \code{\link[=fsx_create_backup]{create_backup}} operation returns while the
backup's lifecycle state is still \code{CREATING}. You can check the backup
creation status by calling the
\code{\link[=fsx_describe_backups]{describe_backups}} operation, which returns the
backup state along with other information.
