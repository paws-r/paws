\description{
Retrieves the \code{PublicAccessBlock} configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.
To use this operation, you must have the \code{s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock}
permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html}{Specifying Permissions in a Policy}.

When Amazon S3 evaluates the \code{PublicAccessBlock} configuration for a
bucket or an object, it checks the \code{PublicAccessBlock} configuration for
both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket
owner's account. If the \code{PublicAccessBlock} settings are different
between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive
combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.

For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an
object public, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status}{The Meaning of "Public"}.
