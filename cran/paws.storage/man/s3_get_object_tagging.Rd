\alias{s3_get_object_tagging}
\title{Returns the tag-set of an object}
\usage{
s3_get_object_tagging(Bucket, Key, VersionId)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bucket}{[required] The bucket name containing the object for which to get the tagging
information.

When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to
the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
\emph{AccessPointName}-\emph{AccountId}.s3-accesspoint.\emph{Region}.amazonaws.com.
When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs,
you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more
information about access point ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html}{Using Access Points}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{Key}{[required] Object key for which to get the tagging information.}

\item{VersionId}{The versionId of the object for which to get the tagging information.}
}
\description{
Returns the tag-set of an object. You send the GET request against the
tagging subresource associated with the object.
}
\details{
To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
\code{s3:GetObjectTagging} action. By default, the GET operation returns
information about current version of an object. For a versioned bucket,
you can have multiple versions of an object in your bucket. To retrieve
tags of any other version, use the versionId query parameter. You also
need permission for the \code{s3:GetObjectVersionTagging} action.

By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant this
permission to others.

For information about the Amazon S3 object tagging feature, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-tagging.html}{Object Tagging}.
