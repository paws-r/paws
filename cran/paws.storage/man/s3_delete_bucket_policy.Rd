\description{
This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the \code{\link[=s3_delete_bucket_policy]{delete_bucket_policy}} permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this operation.
