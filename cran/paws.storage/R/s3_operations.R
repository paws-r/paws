#' This action aborts a multipart upload
#'
#' @description
#' This action aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.

#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_copy_object/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_copy_object/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param ACL The canned ACL to apply to the object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param Bucket &#91;required&#93; The name of the destination bucket.
#' 
#' When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
#' the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
#' *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
#' When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web

#' takes the form
#' ` AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`.
#' When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web

#' is S3 on
#' Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param CacheControl Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
#' @param ChecksumAlgorithm Indicates the algorithm you want Amazon S3 to use to create the checksum
#' for the object. For more information, see [Checking object
#' integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param ContentDisposition Specifies presentational information for the object.
#' @param ContentEncoding Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
#' thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
#' referenced by the Content-Type header field.
#' @param ContentLanguage The language the content is in.
#' @param ContentType A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.
#' @param CopySource &#91;required&#93; Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
#' value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the
#' source object through an [access
#' point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html):
#' 
#' -   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
#'     of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by
#'     a slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf`
#'     from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
#'     `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be
#'     URL-encoded.
#' 
#' -   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
#'     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
#'     point, in the format
#'     `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`.
#'     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access
#'     point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
#'     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
#'     `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.
#'     The value must be URL encoded.
#' 
#'     Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the
#'     source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services
#'     Region.
#' 
#'     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
#'     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
#'     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`.
#'     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
#'     outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
#'     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
#'     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.
#'     The value must be URL-encoded.
#' 
#' To copy a specific version of an object, append
#' `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
#' `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).
#' If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version
#' of the source object.
#' @param CopySourceIfMatch Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.
#' @param CopySourceIfModifiedSince Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.
#' @param CopySourceIfNoneMatch Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the
#' specified ETag.
#' @param CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.
#' @param Expires The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.
#' @param GrantFullControl Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the
#' object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantRead Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantReadACP Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantWriteACP Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param Key &#91;required&#93; The key of the destination object.
#' @param Metadata A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
#' @param MetadataDirective Specifies whether the metadata is copied from the source object or
#' replaced with metadata provided in the request.
#' @param TaggingDirective Specifies whether the object tag-set are copied from the source object
#' or replaced with tag-set provided in the request.
#' @param ServerSideEncryption The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
#' Amazon S3 (for example, `AES256`, `aws:kms`, `aws:kms:dsse`).
#' @param StorageClass By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
#' created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
#' high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
#' different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
#' Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage
#' Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param WebsiteRedirectLocation If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
#' object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
#' Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. This
#' value is unique to each object and is not copied when using the
#' `x-amz-metadata-directive` header. Instead, you may opt to provide this
#' header in combination with the directive.
#' @param SSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param SSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
#' encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
#' discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
#' appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.
#' @param SSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param SSEKMSKeyId Specifies the KMS key ID to use for object encryption. All GET and PUT
#' requests for an object protected by KMS will fail if they're not made
#' via SSL or using SigV4. For information about configuring any of the
#' officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services
#' CLI, see [Specifying the Signature Version in Request
#' Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param SSEKMSEncryptionContext Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for
#' object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8
#' string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.
#' @param BucketKeyEnabled Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
#' encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service
#' (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to
#' use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS.
#' 
#' Specifying this header with a COPY action doesn’t affect bucket-level
#' settings for S3 Bucket Key.
#' @param CopySourceSSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param CopySourceSSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to
#' decrypt the source object. The encryption key provided in this header
#' must be one that was used when the source object was created.
#' @param CopySourceSSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param RequestPayer 
#' @param Tagging The tag-set for the object destination object this value must be used in
#' conjunction with the `TaggingDirective`. The tag-set must be encoded as
#' URL Query parameters.
#' @param ObjectLockMode The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the copied object.
#' @param ObjectLockRetainUntilDate The date and time when you want the copied object's Object Lock to
#' expire.
#' @param ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus Specifies whether you want to apply a legal hold to the copied object.
#' @param ExpectedBucketOwner The account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the
#' destination bucket is owned by a different account, the request fails
#' with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).
#' @param ExpectedSourceBucketOwner The account ID of the expected source bucket owner. If the source bucket
#' is owned by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status
#' code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param CacheControl Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.
#' @param ContentDisposition Specifies presentational information for the object.
#' @param ContentEncoding Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
#' thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
#' referenced by the Content-Type header field.
#' @param ContentLanguage The language the content is in.
#' @param ContentType A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.
#' @param Expires The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.
#' @param GrantFullControl Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the
#' object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantRead Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantReadACP Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantWriteACP Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param Key &#91;required&#93; Object key for which the multipart upload is to be initiated.
#' @param Metadata A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
#' @param ServerSideEncryption The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
#' Amazon S3 (for example, `AES256`, `aws:kms`).
#' @param StorageClass By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
#' created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
#' high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
#' different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
#' Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage
#' Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param WebsiteRedirectLocation If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
#' object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
#' Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.
#' @param SSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param SSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
#' encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
#' discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
#' appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.
#' @param SSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param SSEKMSKeyId Specifies the ID of the symmetric encryption customer managed key to use
#' for object encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an object protected
#' by KMS will fail if they're not made via SSL or using SigV4. For
#' information about configuring any of the officially supported Amazon Web
#' Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see [Specifying the Signature
#' Version in Request
#' Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param SSEKMSEncryptionContext Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for
#' object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8
#' string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.
#' @param BucketKeyEnabled Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
#' encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service
#' (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to
#' use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS.
#' 
#' Specifying this header with an object action doesn’t affect bucket-level
#' settings for S3 Bucket Key.
#' @param RequestPayer 
#' @param Tagging The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
#' parameters.
#' @param ObjectLockMode Specifies the Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the uploaded
#' object.
#' @param ObjectLockRetainUntilDate Specifies the date and time when you want the Object Lock to expire.
#' @param ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus Specifies whether you want to apply a legal hold to the uploaded object.
#' @param ExpectedBucketOwner The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
#' different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
#' `403 Forbidden` (access denied).
#' @param ChecksumAlgorithm Indicates the algorithm you want Amazon S3 to use to create the checksum
#' for the object. For more information, see [Checking object
#' integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)

#' The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the
#' object itself
#'
#' @description
#' The `HEAD` action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This action is useful if you're only interested in an object's metadata. To use `HEAD`, you must have READ access to the object.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_head_object/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_head_object/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Bucket &#91;required&#93; The name of the bucket containing the object.
#' 
#' When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
#' the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
#' *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
#' When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
#' Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
#' name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access
#' points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' 
#' When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
#' requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
#' takes the form
#' ` AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`.
#' When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
#' Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the
#' bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see [What
#' is S3 on
#' Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param IfMatch Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the one
#' specified; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.
#' @param IfModifiedSince Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time;
#' otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.
#' @param IfNoneMatch Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from the
#' one specified; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.
#' @param IfUnmodifiedSince Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified
#' time; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.
#' @param Key &#91;required&#93; The object key.
#' @param Range HeadObject returns only the metadata for an object. If the Range is
#' satisfiable, only the `ContentLength` is affected in the response. If
#' the Range is not satisfiable, S3 returns a
#' `416 - Requested Range Not Satisfiable` error.
#' @param VersionId VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.
#' @param SSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param SSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
#' encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
#' discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
#' appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.
#' @param SSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param RequestPayer 
#' @param PartNumber Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between
#' 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for the part
#' specified. Useful querying about the size of the part and the number of
#' parts in this object.
#' @param ExpectedBucketOwner The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
#' different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
#' `403 Forbidden` (access denied).
#' @param ChecksumMode To retrieve the checksum, this parameter must be enabled.
#' 
#' In addition, if you enable `ChecksumMode` and the object is encrypted
#' with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services
#' KMS), you must have permission to use the `kms:Decrypt` action for the
#' request to succeed.

#' Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload
#'
#' @description
#' Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload. This operation must include the upload ID, which you obtain by sending the initiate multipart upload request (see [`create_multipart_upload`][s3_create_multipart_upload]). This request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The default number of parts returned is 1,000 parts. You can restrict the number of parts returned by specifying the `max-parts` request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an `IsTruncated` field with the value of true, and a `NextPartNumberMarker` element. In subsequent [`list_parts`][s3_list_parts] requests you can include the part-number-marker query string parameter and set its value to the `NextPartNumberMarker` field value from the previous response.

#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param GrantWriteACP Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
#' 
#' This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
#' @param Key &#91;required&#93; Object key for which the PUT action was initiated.
#' @param Metadata A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
#' @param ServerSideEncryption The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in
#' Amazon S3 (for example, `AES256`, `aws:kms`, `aws:kms:dsse`).
#' @param StorageClass By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
#' created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
#' high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
#' different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
#' Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage
#' Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param WebsiteRedirectLocation If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this
#' object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.
#' Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For
#' information about object metadata, see [Object Key and
#' Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingMetadata.html).
#' 
#' In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an
#' object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:
#' 
#' `x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html`
#' 
#' In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to
#' another website:
#' 
#' `x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/`
#' 
#' For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see [Hosting
#' Websites on Amazon
#' S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html)
#' and [How to Configure Website Page
#' Redirects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-page-redirect.html).
#' @param SSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param SSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
#' encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
#' discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
#' appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.
#' @param SSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param SSEKMSKeyId If `x-amz-server-side-encryption` has a valid value of `aws:kms` or
#' `aws:kms:dsse`, this header specifies the ID of the Key Management
#' Service (KMS) symmetric encryption customer managed key that was used
#' for the object. If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms` or
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse`, but do not
#' provide` x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses
#' the Amazon Web Services managed key (`aws/s3`) to protect the data. If
#' the KMS key does not exist in the same account that's issuing the
#' command, you must use the full ARN and not just the ID.
#' @param SSEKMSEncryptionContext Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for
#' object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8
#' string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs. This
#' value is stored as object metadata and automatically gets passed on to
#' Amazon Web Services KMS for future [`get_object`][s3_get_object] or
#' [`copy_object`][s3_copy_object] operations on this object.
#' @param BucketKeyEnabled Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
#' encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service
#' (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to
#' use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS.
#' 
#' Specifying this header with a PUT action doesn’t affect bucket-level
#' settings for S3 Bucket Key.
#' @param RequestPayer 
#' @param Tagging The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query
#' parameters. (For example, "Key1=Value1")
#' @param ObjectLockMode The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.
#' @param ObjectLockRetainUntilDate The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire.
#' Must be formatted as a timestamp parameter.
#' @param ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more
#' information about S3 Object Lock, see [Object
#' Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html).
#' @param ExpectedBucketOwner The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a
#' different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code
#' `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

#' Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source
#'
#' @description
#' Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. You specify the data source by adding the request header `x-amz-copy-source` in your request and a byte range by adding the request header `x-amz-copy-source-range` in your request.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_upload_part_copy/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/s3_upload_part_copy/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Bucket &#91;required&#93; The bucket name.
#' 
#' When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to
#' the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
#' *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
#' When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
#' Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
#' name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access
#' points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' 
#' When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
#' requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
#' takes the form
#' ` AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`.
#' When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
#' Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the
#' bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see [What
#' is S3 on
#' Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
#' in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
#' @param CopySource &#91;required&#93; Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
#' value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the
#' source object through an [access
#' point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html):
#' 
#' -   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
#'     of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a
#'     slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf`
#'     from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
#'     `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be
#'     URL-encoded.
#' 
#' -   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
#'     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
#'     point, in the format
#'     `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`.
#'     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access
#'     point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
#'     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
#'     `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.
#'     The value must be URL encoded.
#' 
#'     Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the
#'     source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services
#'     Region.
#' 
#'     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
#'     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
#'     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`.
#'     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
#'     outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
#'     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
#'     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.
#'     The value must be URL-encoded.
#' 
#' To copy a specific version of an object, append
#' `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
#' `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).
#' If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version
#' of the source object.
#' @param CopySourceIfMatch Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.
#' @param CopySourceIfModifiedSince Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.
#' @param CopySourceIfNoneMatch Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the
#' specified ETag.
#' @param CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.
#' @param CopySourceRange The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value must
#' use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the
#' zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates that
#' you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a range
#' only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.
#' @param Key &#91;required&#93; Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.
#' @param PartNumber &#91;required&#93; Part number of part being copied. This is a positive integer between 1
#' and 10,000.
#' @param UploadId &#91;required&#93; Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being copied.
#' @param SSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param SSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
#' encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
#' discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
#' appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
#' `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header. This must be
#' the same encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload
#' request.
#' @param SSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
#' that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
#' @param CopySourceSSECustomerAlgorithm Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for
#' example, AES256).
#' @param CopySourceSSECustomerKey Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to
#' decrypt the source object. The encryption key provided in this header
#' must be one that was used when the source object was created.
#' @param CopySourceSSECustomerKeyMD5 Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
#' 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure
