#' You call this operation to inform Amazon Glacier (Glacier) that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault.

#' This operation deletes a vault

#' This operation deletes a vault. Amazon Glacier will delete a vault only if there are no archives in the vault as of the last inventory and there have been no writes to the vault since the last inventory. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault deletion fails (that is, the vault is not removed) and Amazon Glacier returns an error. You can use [`describe_vault`][glacier_describe_vault] to return the number of archives in a vault, and you can use [Initiate a Job (POST jobs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html) to initiate a new inventory retrieval for a vault.

#' This operation downloads the output of the job you initiated using
#' InitiateJob
#'
#' @description
#' This operation downloads the output of the job you initiated using [`initiate_job`][glacier_initiate_job]. Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault inventory.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/glacier_get_job_output/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/glacier_get_job_output/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param accountId &#91;required&#93; The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the
#' vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single
#' '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID
#' associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an
#' account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
#' @param vaultName &#91;required&#93; The name of the vault.
#' @param jobId &#91;required&#93; The job ID whose data is downloaded.
#' @param range The range of bytes to retrieve from the output. For example, if you want
#' to download the first 1,048,576 bytes, specify the range as
#' `bytes=0-1048575`. By default, this operation downloads the entire
#' output.
#' 
#' If the job output is large, then you can use a range to retrieve a
#' portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output in
#' smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job
#' output you want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks of
#' data at a time, which is a total of eight Get Job Output requests. You
#' use the following process to download the job output:
#' 
#' 1.  Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate byte
#'     range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received.
#' 
#' 2.  Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree hash of the
#'     payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client and
#'     compare it with the checksum you received in the response to ensure
#'     you received all the expected data.
#' 
#' 3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output data,
#'     each time specifying the appropriate byte range.
#' 
#' 4.  After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list
#'     of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to
#'     find the checksum of the entire output. Using the
#'     [`describe_job`][glacier_describe_job] API, obtain job information
#'     of the job that provided you the output. The response includes the
#'     checksum of the entire archive stored in Amazon Glacier. You compare
#'     this value with the checksum you computed to ensure you have
#'     downloaded the entire archive content with no errors.

#' @description
#' This operation configures an access policy for a vault and will overwrite an existing policy. To configure a vault access policy, send a PUT request to the `access-policy` subresource of the vault. An access policy is specific to a vault and is also called a vault subresource. You can set one access policy per vault and the policy can be up to 20 KB in size.
