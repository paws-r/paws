#' Creates a new, empty file system
#'
#' Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation
#' token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation
#' (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a
#' file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller\'s AWS
#' account with the specified creation token, this operation does the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an
#'     Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state `creating`.
#' 
#' -   Returns with the description of the created file system.
#' 
#' Otherwise, this operation returns a `FileSystemAlreadyExists` error with
#' the ID of the existing file system.
#' 
#' For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the
#' creation token.
#' 
#' The idempotent operation allows you to retry a `CreateFileSystem` call
#' without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an
#' initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a
#' file system was actually created. An example might be that a transport
#' level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use
#' the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a
#' file system, the client can learn of its existence from the
#' `FileSystemAlreadyExists` error.
#' 
#' The `CreateFileSystem` call returns while the file system\'s lifecycle
#' state is still `creating`. You can check the file system creation status
#' by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which among other things
#' returns the file system state.
#' 
#' This operation also takes an optional `PerformanceMode` parameter that
#' you choose for your file system. We recommend `generalPurpose`
#' performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the `maxIO`
#' performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and
#' operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for
#' most file operations. The performance mode can\'t be changed after the
#' file system has been created. For more information, see [Amazon EFS:
#' Performance
#' Modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html).
#' 
#' After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle
#' state to `available`, at which point you can create one or more mount
#' targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see
#' CreateMountTarget. You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2
#' instances in your VPC by using the mount target. For more information,
#' see [Amazon EFS: How it
#' Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html).
#' 
#' This operation requires permissions for the
#' `elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem` action.
#'
#' @usage
#' efs_create_file_system(CreationToken, PerformanceMode, Encrypted,
#'   KmsKeyId, ThroughputMode, ProvisionedThroughputInMibps, Tags)
#'
#' @param CreationToken &#91;required&#93; A string of up to 64 ASCII characters. Amazon EFS uses this to ensure
#' idempotent creation.
#' @param PerformanceMode The performance mode of the file system. We recommend `generalPurpose`
#' performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the `maxIO`
#' performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and
#' operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for
#' most file operations. The performance mode can\'t be changed after the
#' file system has been created.
#' @param Encrypted A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When
#' creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying
#' CreateFileSystemRequest\\$KmsKeyId for an existing AWS Key Management
#' Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). If you don\'t specify a
#' CMK, then the default CMK for Amazon EFS, `/aws/elasticfilesystem`, is
#' used to protect the encrypted file system.
#' @param KmsKeyId The ID of the AWS KMS CMK to be used to protect the encrypted file
#' system. This parameter is only required if you want to use a nondefault
#' CMK. If this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for Amazon EFS
#' is used. This ID can be in one of the following formats:
#' 
#' -   Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example
#'     `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
#' 
#' -   ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example
#'     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
#' 
#' -   Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example
#'     `alias/projectKey1`.
#' 
#' -   Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example
#'     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1`.
#' 
#' If `KmsKeyId` is specified, the CreateFileSystemRequest\\$Encrypted
#' parameter must be set to true.
#' @param ThroughputMode The throughput mode for the file system to be created. There are two
#' throughput modes to choose from for your file system: `bursting` and
#' `provisioned`. If you set `ThroughputMode` to `provisioned`, you must
#' also set a value for `ProvisionedThroughPutInMibps`. You can decrease
#' your file system\'s throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change
#' between the throughput modes as long as it's been more than 24 hours
#' since the last decrease or throughput mode change. For more, see
#' [Specifying Throughput with Provisioned
#' Mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#provisioned-throughput)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide.*
#' @param ProvisionedThroughputInMibps The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file
#' system that you\'re creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if
#' `ThroughputMode` is set to `provisioned`. The upper limit for throughput
#' is 1024 MiB/s. You can get this limit increased by contacting AWS
#' Support. For more information, see [Amazon EFS Limits That You Can
#' Increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits)
#' in the *Amazon EFS User Guide.*
#' @param Tags A value that specifies to create one or more tags associated with the
#' file system. Each tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file
#' system on creation by including a `"Key":"Name","Value":"\{value\}"`
#' key-value pair.

#' Creates a mount target for a file system
#'
#' Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file
#' system on EC2 instances by using the mount target.
#' 
#' You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC.
#' All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a
#' single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple
#' subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the
#' subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount
#' target in order to access their file system. For more information, see
#' [Amazon EFS: How it
#' Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html).
#' 
#' In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are
#' creating the mount target and the file system\'s lifecycle state must be
#' `available`. For more information, see DescribeFileSystems.
#' 
#' In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which determines the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
#' 
#' -   Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
#' 
#' -   IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the
#'     mount target (if you don\'t specify an IP address in the request)
#' 
#' After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that
#' includes, a `MountTargetId` and an `IpAddress`. You use this IP address
#' when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the
#' mount target\'s DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance
#' on which you mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve
#' the mount target\'s DNS name to its IP address. For more information,
#' see [How it Works: Implementation
#' Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation).
#' 
#' Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one
#' VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That
#' is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for
#' it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must
#' meet the following requirements:
#' 
#' -   Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount
#'     targets
#' 
#' -   Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of
#'     the existing mount targets
#' 
#' If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.
#' 
#' -   Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:
#' 
#'     -   If the request provides an `IpAddress`, Amazon EFS assigns that
#'         IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS
#'         assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the
#'         Amazon EC2 `CreateNetworkInterface` call does when a request
#'         does not specify a primary private IP address).
#' 
#'     -   If the request provides `SecurityGroups`, this network interface
#'         is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs
#'         to the default security group for the subnet\'s VPC.
#' 
#'     -   Assigns the description
#'         `Mount target <i>fsmt-id</i> for file system <i>fs-id</i> `
#'         where ` <i>fsmt-id</i> ` is the mount target ID, and
#'         ` <i>fs-id</i> ` is the `FileSystemId`.
#' 
#'     -   Sets the `requesterManaged` property of the network interface to
#'         `true`, and the `requesterId` value to `EFS`.
#' 
#'     Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed
#'     EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created,
#'     Amazon EFS sets the `NetworkInterfaceId` field in the mount
#'     target\'s description to the network interface ID, and the
#'     `IpAddress` field to its address. If network interface creation
#'     fails, the entire `CreateMountTarget` operation fails.
#' 
#' The `CreateMountTarget` call returns only after creating the network
#' interface, but while the mount target state is still `creating`, you can
#' check the mount target creation status by calling the
#' DescribeMountTargets operation, which among other things returns the
#' mount target state.
#' 
#' We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability
#' Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an
#' Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability
#' Zone. For more information, see [Amazon
#' EFS](http://aws.amazon.com/efs/). In addition, by always using a mount
#' target local to the instance\'s Availability Zone, you eliminate a
#' partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount
#' target is created goes down, then you can\'t access your file system
#' through that mount target.

#' system:
#'

#'
