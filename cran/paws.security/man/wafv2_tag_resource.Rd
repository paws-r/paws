\details{
Associates tags with the specified AWS resource. Tags are key:value
pairs that you can use to categorize and manage your resources, for
purposes like billing. For example, you might set the tag key to
"customer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You can specify one
or more tags to add to each AWS resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

You can tag the AWS resources that you manage through AWS WAF: web ACLs,
rule groups, IP sets, and regex pattern sets. You can't manage or view
tags through the AWS WAF console.
