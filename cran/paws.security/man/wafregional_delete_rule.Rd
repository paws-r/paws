\description{
This is \strong{AWS WAF Classic} documentation. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html}{AWS WAF Classic}
in the developer guide.
}
\details{
\strong{For the latest version of AWS WAF}, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html}{AWS WAF Developer Guide}.
With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for
regional and global use.

Permanently deletes a Rule. You can't delete a \code{Rule} if it's still used
in any \code{WebACL} objects or if it still includes any predicates, such as
\code{ByteMatchSet} objects.

If you just want to remove a \code{Rule} from a \code{WebACL}, use UpdateWebACL.

To permanently delete a \code{Rule} from AWS WAF, perform the following
steps:
\enumerate{
\item Update the \code{Rule} to remove predicates, if any. For more
information, see UpdateRule.
\item Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the
\code{ChangeToken} parameter of a \code{DeleteRule} request.
\item Submit a \code{DeleteRule} request.
