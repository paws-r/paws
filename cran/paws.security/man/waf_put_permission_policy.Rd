\strong{For the latest version of AWS WAF}, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for
regional and global use.

Attaches an IAM policy to the specified resource. The only supported use

\itemize{
\item You can attach only one policy with each \code{PutPermissionPolicy}
request.
\item The policy must include an \code{Effect}, \code{Action} and \code{Principal}.
\item \code{Effect} must specify \code{Allow}.
\item The \code{Action} in the policy must be \code{waf:UpdateWebACL},
\code{waf-regional:UpdateWebACL}, \code{waf:GetRuleGroup} and
\code{waf-regional:GetRuleGroup} . Any extra or wildcard actions in the
policy will be rejected.
\item The policy cannot include a \code{Resource} parameter.
\item The ARN in the request must be a valid WAF RuleGroup ARN and the
RuleGroup must exist in the same region.
\item The user making the request must be the owner of the RuleGroup.
\item Your policy must be composed using IAM Policy version 2012-10-17.
