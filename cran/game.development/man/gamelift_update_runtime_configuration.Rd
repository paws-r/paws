in the fleet}
\usage{
gamelift_update_runtime_configuration(FleetId, RuntimeConfiguration)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetId}{[required] Unique identifier for a fleet to update run-time configuration for.}

\item{RuntimeConfiguration}{[required] Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the
fleet. The run-time configuration for a fleet has a collection of server
process configurations, one for each type of server process to run on an
instance. A server process configuration specifies the location of the
server executable, launch parameters, and the number of concurrent
processes with that configuration to maintain on each instance.}
}
\description{
Updates the current run-time configuration for the specified fleet,
which tells Amazon GameLift how to launch server processes on instances
in the fleet. You can update a fleet's run-time configuration at any
time after the fleet is created; it does not need to be in an \code{ACTIVE}
status.
}
\details{
To update run-time configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a
\code{RuntimeConfiguration} object with the updated collection of server
process configurations.

Each instance in a Amazon GameLift fleet checks regularly for an updated
run-time configuration and changes how it launches server processes to
comply with the latest version. Existing server processes are not
affected by the update; they continue to run until they end, while
Amazon GameLift simply adds new server processes to fit the current
run-time configuration. As a result, the run-time configuration changes
are applied gradually as existing processes shut down and new processes
are launched in Amazon GameLift's normal process recycling activity.
