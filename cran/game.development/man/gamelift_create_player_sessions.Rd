\item{PlayerDataMap}{Map of string pairs, each specifying a player ID and a set of
developer-defined information related to the player. Amazon GameLift

\description{
Adds a group of players to a game session. This action is useful with a
team matching feature. Before players can be added, a game session must
have an \code{ACTIVE} status, have a creation policy of \code{ALLOW_ALL}, and have
an open player slot. To add a single player to a game session, use
CreatePlayerSession.
}
\details{
To create player sessions, specify a game session ID, a list of player
IDs, and optionally a set of player data strings. If successful, the
players are added to the game session and a set of new PlayerSession
objects is returned. Player sessions cannot be updated.

\emph{Available in Amazon GameLift Local.}
