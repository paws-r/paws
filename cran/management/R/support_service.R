#' AWS Support
#'
#' @description
#' The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need
#' detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types.
#' This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases
#' programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON
#' format.
#' 
#' The AWS Support service also exposes a set of [Trusted
#' Advisor](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/) features.
#' You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check
#' results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of
#' checks.
#' 
#' The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:
#' 
#' -   **Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels.**
#'     The DescribeServices and DescribeSeverityLevels operations return
#'     AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem
#'     severity levels. You use these values when you call the CreateCase
#'     operation.
#' 
#' -   **Case creation, case details, and case resolution.** The
#'     CreateCase, DescribeCases, DescribeAttachment, and ResolveCase
#'     operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about
#'     cases, and resolve cases.
#' 
#' -   **Case communication.** The DescribeCommunications,
#'     AddCommunicationToCase, and AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve
#'     and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.
#' 
#' The following list describes the operations available from the AWS
#' Support service for Trusted Advisor:
#' 
#' -   DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run
#'     against your AWS resources.
#' 
#' -   Using the `checkId` for a specific check returned by
#'     DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call
#'     DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult to obtain the results for the
#'     check you specified.
#' 
#' -   DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for
#'     one or more Trusted Advisor checks.
#' 
#' -   RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a
#'     specified check.
#' 
#' -   DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh
#'     status of one or more checks.
#' 
#' For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses [Signature Version 4
#' Signing
#' Process](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
#' 
#' See [About the AWS Support
#' API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html) in
#' the *AWS Support User Guide* for information about how to use this
#' service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted
#' Advisor for results of checks on your resources.
