#' AWS Health APIs and Notifications
#'
#' @description
#' AWS Health
#' 
#' The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health
#' information that is presented in the [AWS Personal Health
#' Dashboard](https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/). You can get
#' information about events that affect your AWS resources:
#' 
#' -   DescribeEvents: Summary information about events.
#' 
#' -   DescribeEventDetails: Detailed information about one or more events.
#' 
#' -   DescribeAffectedEntities: Information about AWS resources that are
#'     affected by one or more events.
#' 
#' In addition, these operations provide information about event types and
#' summary counts of events or affected entities:
#' 
#' -   DescribeEventTypes: Information about the kinds of events that AWS
#'     Health tracks.
#' 
#' -   DescribeEventAggregates: A count of the number of events that meet
#'     specified criteria.
#' 
#' -   DescribeEntityAggregates: A count of the number of affected entities
#'     that meet specified criteria.
#' 
#' The Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from [AWS
#' Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/). Calling the Health API
#' from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan
#' causes a `SubscriptionRequiredException`.
#' 
#' For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the [Signature Version 4
#' Signing
#' Process](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
#' 
#' See the [AWS Health User
#' Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html)
#' for information about how to use the API.
#' 
#' **Service Endpoint**
#' 
#' The HTTP endpoint for the AWS Health API is:
#' 
#' -   https://health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

#' \donttest{svc$describe_affected_entities(
#'   Foo = 123
