\item{Filter}{The filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{instance-family} - The instance family (for example, \code{m4}).

\code{PartialUpfront} | \code{AllUpfront}).

\code{payment-failed} | \code{active} | \code{retired}).
\item \verb{tag:<key>} - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag

the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,

\item{HostReservationIdSet}{The host reservation IDs.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single
page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with
the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If
