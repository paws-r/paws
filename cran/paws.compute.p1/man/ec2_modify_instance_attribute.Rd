}
\arguments{
\item{SourceDestCheck}{Enable or disable source/destination checks, which ensure that the
instance is either the source or the destination of any traffic that it
receives. If the value is \code{true}, source/destination checks are enabled;
otherwise, they are disabled. The default value is \code{true}. You must
disable source/destination checks if the instance runs services such as
network address translation, routing, or firewalls.}

\item{Attribute}{The name of the attribute.}

\item{BlockDeviceMappings}{Modifies the \code{DeleteOnTermination} attribute for volumes that are
currently attached. The volume must be owned by the caller. If no value
is specified for \code{DeleteOnTermination}, the default is \code{true} and the
volume is deleted when the instance is terminated.

To add instance store volumes to an Amazon EBS-backed instance, you must
add them when you launch the instance. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html#Using_OverridingAMIBDM}{Update the block device mapping when launching an instance}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}.}

\item{DisableApiTermination}{If the value is \code{true}, you can't terminate the instance using the
Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API; otherwise, you can. You cannot use this
parameter for Spot Instances.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{EbsOptimized}{Specifies whether the instance is optimized for Amazon EBS I/O. This
optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an
optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O performance.
This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional
usage charges apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.}

\item{EnaSupport}{Set to \code{true} to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the instance.

This option is supported only for HVM instances. Specifying this option
with a PV instance can make it unreachable.}

\item{Groups}{[EC2-VPC] Replaces the security groups of the instance with the
specified security groups. You must specify at least one security group,
even if it's just the default security group for the VPC. You must
specify the security group ID, not the security group name.}

\item{InstanceId}{[required] The ID of the instance.}

\item{InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior}{Specifies whether an instance stops or terminates when you initiate
shutdown from the instance (using the operating system command for
system shutdown).}

\item{InstanceType}{Changes the instance type to the specified value. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html}{Instance types}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}. If the instance type is not valid, the
error returned is \code{InvalidInstanceAttributeValue}.}

\item{Kernel}{Changes the instance's kernel to the specified value. We recommend that
you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information,
see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html}{PV-GRUB}.}

\item{Ramdisk}{Changes the instance's RAM disk to the specified value. We recommend
that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more
information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html}{PV-GRUB}.}

\item{SriovNetSupport}{Set to \code{simple} to enable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599
Virtual Function interface for the instance.

There is no way to disable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599
Virtual Function interface at this time.

This option is supported only for HVM instances. Specifying this option
with a PV instance can make it unreachable.}

\item{UserData}{Changes the instance's user data to the specified value. If you are
using an Amazon Web Services SDK or command line tool, base64-encoding
is performed for you, and you can load the text from a file. Otherwise,
you must provide base64-encoded text.}

\item{Value}{A new value for the attribute. Use only with the \code{kernel}, \code{ramdisk},
\code{userData}, \code{disableApiTermination}, or
\code{instanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior} attribute.}

\item{DisableApiStop}{Indicates whether an instance is enabled for stop protection. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html#Using_StopProtection}{Stop Protection}.}
