ec2_describe_volumes(
  Filters = NULL,
  VolumeIds = NULL,
  DryRun = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Filters}{The filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{attachment.attach-time} - The time stamp when the attachment
initiated.
\item \code{attachment.delete-on-termination} - Whether the volume is deleted
on instance termination.
\item \code{attachment.device} - The device name specified in the block device
mapping (for example, \verb{/dev/sda1}).
\item \code{attachment.instance-id} - The ID of the instance the volume is
attached to.
\item \code{attachment.status} - The attachment state (\code{attaching} | \code{attached}
| \code{detaching}).
\item \code{availability-zone} - The Availability Zone in which the volume was
created.
\item \code{create-time} - The time stamp when the volume was created.
\item \code{encrypted} - Indicates whether the volume is encrypted (\code{true} |
\code{false})
\item \code{multi-attach-enabled} - Indicates whether the volume is enabled for
Multi-Attach (\code{true} | \code{false})
\item \code{fast-restored} - Indicates whether the volume was created from a
snapshot that is enabled for fast snapshot restore (\code{true} |
\code{false}).
\item \code{size} - The size of the volume, in GiB.
\item \code{snapshot-id} - The snapshot from which the volume was created.
\item \code{status} - The state of the volume (\code{creating} | \code{available} |
\verb{in-use} | \code{deleting} | \code{deleted} | \code{error}).
\item \code{tag}:\<key\> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag
with the key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for
the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{volume-id} - The volume ID.
\item \code{volume-type} - The Amazon EBS volume type (\code{gp2} | \code{gp3} | \code{io1} |
\code{io2} | \code{st1} | \code{sc1}| \code{standard})
}}

\item{VolumeIds}{The volume IDs.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of volume results returned by
\code{\link[=ec2_describe_volumes]{describe_volumes}} in paginated output. When
this parameter is used, \code{\link[=ec2_describe_volumes]{describe_volumes}} only
returns \code{MaxResults} results in a single page along with a \code{NextToken}
response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be
seen by sending another \code{\link[=ec2_describe_volumes]{describe_volumes}}
request with the returned \code{NextToken} value. This value can be between 5
and 500; if \code{MaxResults} is given a value larger than 500, only 500
results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then
\code{\link[=ec2_describe_volumes]{describe_volumes}} returns all results. You
cannot specify this parameter and the volume IDs parameter in the same
request.}

\item{NextToken}{The \code{NextToken} value returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=ec2_describe_volumes]{describe_volumes}} request where \code{MaxResults}
was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter.
Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned
the \code{NextToken} value. This value is \code{null} when there are no more
results to return.}
