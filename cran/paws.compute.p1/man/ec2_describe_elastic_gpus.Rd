)
}
\arguments{
\item{ElasticGpuIds}{The Elastic Graphics accelerator IDs.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have

\item \code{availability-zone} - The Availability Zone in which the Elastic
Graphics accelerator resides.
\item \code{elastic-gpu-health} - The status of the Elastic Graphics
accelerator (\code{OK} | \code{IMPAIRED}).
\item \code{elastic-gpu-state} - The state of the Elastic Graphics accelerator
(\code{ATTACHED}).
\item \code{elastic-gpu-type} - The type of Elastic Graphics accelerator; for
example, \code{eg1.medium}.
\item \code{instance-id} - The ID of the instance to which the Elastic Graphics
accelerator is associated.
}}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve
the remaining results, make another call with the returned \code{NextToken}
