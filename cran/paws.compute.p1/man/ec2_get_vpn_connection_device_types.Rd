files can be provided}
\usage{
ec2_get_vpn_connection_device_types(
  MaxResults = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL,
  DryRun = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results returned by
\code{\link[=ec2_get_vpn_connection_device_types]{get_vpn_connection_device_types}}
in paginated output. When this parameter is used,
\code{\link[=ec2_get_vpn_connection_device_types]{get_vpn_connection_device_types}}
only returns \code{MaxResults} results in a single page along with a
\code{NextToken} response element. The remaining results of the initial
request can be seen by sending another
\code{\link[=ec2_get_vpn_connection_device_types]{get_vpn_connection_device_types}}
request with the returned \code{NextToken} value. This value can be between
200 and 1000. If this parameter is not used, then
\code{\link[=ec2_get_vpn_connection_device_types]{get_vpn_connection_device_types}}
returns all results.}

\item{NextToken}{The \code{NextToken} value returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=ec2_get_vpn_connection_device_types]{get_vpn_connection_device_types}}
request where \code{MaxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value
of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous
results that returned the \code{NextToken} value. This value is null when
there are no more results to return.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}
