\arguments{
\item{AvailabilityZoneGroup}{The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests.

When you specify an Availability Zone group in a Spot Instance request,
all Spot Instances in the request are launched in the same Availability
Zone. Instance proximity is maintained with this parameter, but the
choice of Availability Zone is not. The group applies only to requests
for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any additional Spot
Instance requests that are specified with the same Availability Zone
group name are launched in that same Availability Zone, as long as at
least one instance from the group is still active.

If there is no active instance running in the Availability Zone group
that you specify for a new Spot Instance request (all instances are
terminated, the request is expired, or the maximum price you specified
falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2 launches the instance
in any Availability Zone where the constraint can be met. Consequently,
the subsequent set of Spot Instances could be placed in a different zone
from the original request, even if you specified the same Availability
Zone group.

Default: Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone.}

\item{BlockDurationMinutes}{Deprecated.}

\item{ClientToken}{Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html}{How to Ensure Idempotency}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances}.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{InstanceCount}{The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch.

Default: 1}

\item{LaunchGroup}{The instance launch group. Launch groups are Spot Instances that launch
together and terminate together.

Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually}

\item{LaunchSpecification}{The launch specification.}

\item{SpotPrice}{The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot
Instance. We do not recommend using this parameter because it can lead
to increased interruptions. If you do not specify this parameter, you
will pay the current Spot price.

If you specify a maximum price, your instances will be interrupted more
frequently than if you do not specify this parameter.}

\item{Type}{The Spot Instance request type.

Default: \code{one-time}}

\item{ValidFrom}{The start date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the
request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until
all instances launch, the request expires, or the request is canceled.
If the request is persistent, the request becomes active at this date
and time and remains active until it expires or is canceled.

The specified start date and time cannot be equal to the current date
and time. You must specify a start date and time that occurs after the
current date and time.}

\item{ValidUntil}{The end date of the request, in UTC format
(\emph{YYYY}-\emph{MM}-\emph{DD}T\emph{HH}:\emph{MM}:\emph{SS}Z).
\itemize{
\item For a persistent request, the request remains active until the
\code{ValidUntil} date and time is reached. Otherwise, the request
remains active until you cancel it.
\item For a one-time request, the request remains active until all
instances launch, the request is canceled, or the \code{ValidUntil} date
and time is reached. By default, the request is valid for 7 days
from the date the request was created.
}}

\item{TagSpecifications}{The key-value pair for tagging the Spot Instance request on creation.
The value for \code{ResourceType} must be \code{spot-instances-request}, otherwise
the Spot Instance request fails. To tag the Spot Instance request after
it has been created, see \code{\link[=ec2_create_tags]{create_tags}}.}

\item{InstanceInterruptionBehavior}{The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The default is
\code{terminate}.}
