\arguments{
\item{ImageId}{[required] The ID of the image for which youâ€™re turning off faster launching, and
removing pre-provisioned snapshots.}

\item{Force}{Forces the image settings to turn off faster launching for your Windows
AMI. This parameter overrides any errors that are encountered while
cleaning up resources in your account.}

}
\description{
Discontinue faster launching for a Windows AMI, and clean up existing pre-provisioned snapshots. When you disable faster launching, the AMI uses the standard launch process for each instance. All pre-provisioned snapshots must be removed before you can enable faster launching again.
