\arguments{
\item{ClientToken}{Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html}{Ensuring Idempotency}.}

supported currency is \code{USD}.}

\item{HostIdSet}{[required] The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts with which the reservation will be
associated.}

\item{LimitPrice}{The specified limit is checked against the total upfront cost of the
reservation (calculated as the offering's upfront cost multiplied by the
host count). If the total upfront cost is greater than the specified
price limit, the request fails. This is used to ensure that the purchase
does not exceed the expected upfront cost of the purchase. At this time,
the only supported currency is \code{USD}. For example, to indicate a limit
price of USD 100, specify 100.00.}
