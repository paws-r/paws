\usage{
applicationautoscaling_register_scalable_target(ServiceNamespace,
  ResourceId, ScalableDimension, MinCapacity, MaxCapacity, RoleARN,
  SuspendedState)

\arguments{
\item{ServiceNamespace}{[required] The namespace of the AWS service that provides the resource. For a

target. This string consists of the resource type and unique identifier.
\itemize{

identifier is the cluster name and service name. Example:
\code{service/default/sample-webapp}.
\item Spot Fleet request - The resource type is \code{spot-fleet-request} and
the unique identifier is the Spot Fleet request ID. Example:
\verb{spot-fleet-request/sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE}.
\item EMR cluster - The resource type is \code{instancegroup} and the unique

is defined by the service provider. More information is available in
our \href{https://github.com/aws/aws-auto-scaling-custom-resource}{GitHub repository}.
\item Amazon Comprehend document classification endpoint - The resource
type and unique identifier are specified using the endpoint ARN.

\item Lambda provisioned concurrency - The resource type is \code{function} and
the unique identifier is the function name with a function version
or alias name suffix that is not \verb{$LATEST}. Example:
\verb{function:my-function:prod} or \verb{function:my-function:1}.
\item Amazon Keyspaces table - The resource type is \code{table} and the unique
identifier is the table name. Example:
\code{keyspace/mykeyspace/table/mytable}.
}}

\item{ScalableDimension}{[required] The scalable dimension associated with the scalable target. This string
consists of the service namespace, resource type, and scaling property.
\itemize{
\item \code{ecs:service:DesiredCount} - The desired task count of an ECS
service.
\item \code{ec2:spot-fleet-request:TargetCapacity} - The target capacity of a
Spot Fleet request.
\item \code{elasticmapreduce:instancegroup:InstanceCount} - The instance count
of an EMR Instance Group.
\item \code{appstream:fleet:DesiredCapacity} - The desired capacity of an
AppStream 2.0 fleet.
\item \code{dynamodb:table:ReadCapacityUnits} - The provisioned read capacity
for a DynamoDB table.
\item \code{dynamodb:table:WriteCapacityUnits} - The provisioned write capacity
for a DynamoDB table.
\item \code{dynamodb:index:ReadCapacityUnits} - The provisioned read capacity
for a DynamoDB global secondary index.
\item \code{dynamodb:index:WriteCapacityUnits} - The provisioned write capacity
for a DynamoDB global secondary index.
\item \code{rds:cluster:ReadReplicaCount} - The count of Aurora Replicas in an
Aurora DB cluster. Available for Aurora MySQL-compatible edition and
Aurora PostgreSQL-compatible edition.
\item \code{sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount} - The number of EC2
instances for an Amazon SageMaker model endpoint variant.
\item \code{custom-resource:ResourceType:Property} - The scalable dimension for
a custom resource provided by your own application or service.
\item \code{comprehend:document-classifier-endpoint:DesiredInferenceUnits} -
The number of inference units for an Amazon Comprehend document
classification endpoint.
\item \verb{lambda:function:ProvisionedConcurrency} - The provisioned
concurrency for a Lambda function.
\item \code{cassandra:table:ReadCapacityUnits} - The provisioned read capacity
for an Amazon Keyspaces table.
\item \code{cassandra:table:WriteCapacityUnits} - The provisioned write
capacity for an Amazon Keyspaces table.
}}

\item{MinCapacity}{The minimum value that you plan to scale in to. When a scaling policy is
in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale in (contract) as needed to
the minimum capacity limit in response to changing demand.

This parameter is required if you are registering a scalable target. For
certain resources, the minimum value allowed is 0. This includes Lambda
provisioned concurrency, Spot Fleet, ECS services, Aurora DB clusters,
EMR clusters, and custom resources. For all other resources, the minimum
value allowed is 1.}

\item{MaxCapacity}{The maximum value that you plan to scale out to. When a scaling policy
is in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale out (expand) as needed
to the maximum capacity limit in response to changing demand.

This parameter is required if you are registering a scalable target.}

\item{RoleARN}{This parameter is required for services that do not support
service-linked roles (such as Amazon EMR), and it must specify the ARN
of an IAM role that allows Application Auto Scaling to modify the
scalable target on your behalf.

If the service supports service-linked roles, Application Auto Scaling
uses a service-linked role, which it creates if it does not yet exist.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-roles}{Application Auto Scaling IAM Roles}.}

\item{SuspendedState}{An embedded object that contains attributes and attribute values that
are used to suspend and resume automatic scaling. Setting the value of
an attribute to \code{true} suspends the specified scaling activities.
Setting it to \code{false} (default) resumes the specified scaling
activities.

\strong{Suspension Outcomes}
\itemize{
\item For \code{DynamicScalingInSuspended}, while a suspension is in effect,
all scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy are
suspended.
\item For \code{DynamicScalingOutSuspended}, while a suspension is in effect,
all scale-out activities that are triggered by a scaling policy are
suspended.
\item For \code{ScheduledScalingSuspended}, while a suspension is in effect,
all scaling activities that involve scheduled actions are suspended.

\description{
Registers or updates a scalable target.
}
\details{
A scalable target is a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale
out and scale in. Scalable targets are uniquely identified by the
combination of resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace.

When you register a new scalable target, you must specify values for
minimum and maximum capacity. Application Auto Scaling scaling policies
will not scale capacity to values that are outside of this range.

After you register a scalable target, you do not need to register it
again to use other Application Auto Scaling operations. To see which
resources have been registered, use
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DescribeScalableTargets.html}{DescribeScalableTargets}.
You can also view the scaling policies for a service namespace by using
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DescribeScalableTargets.html}{DescribeScalableTargets}.
If you no longer need a scalable target, you can deregister it by using
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DeregisterScalableTarget.html}{DeregisterScalableTarget}.

To update a scalable target, specify the parameters that you want to
change. Include the parameters that identify the scalable target:
resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace. Any parameters that you
don\'t specify are not changed by this update request.
