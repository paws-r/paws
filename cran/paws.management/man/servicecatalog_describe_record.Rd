\description{
Gets information about the specified request operation.
}
\details{
Use this operation after calling a request operation (for example,
ProvisionProduct, TerminateProvisionedProduct, or
UpdateProvisionedProduct).

If a provisioned product was transferred to a new owner using
UpdateProvisionedProductProperties, the new owner will be able to
describe all past records for that product. The previous owner will no
longer be able to describe the records, but will be able to use
ListRecordHistory to see the product\'s history from when he was the
owner.
