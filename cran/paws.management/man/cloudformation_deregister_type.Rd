\description{
Removes a type or type version from active use in the CloudFormation
registry. If a type or type version is deregistered, it cannot be used
in CloudFormation operations.
}
\details{
To deregister a type, you must individually deregister all registered
versions of that type. If a type has only a single registered version,
deregistering that version results in the type itself being
deregistered.

You cannot deregister the default version of a type, unless it is the
only registered version of that type, in which case the type itself is
deregistered as well.
