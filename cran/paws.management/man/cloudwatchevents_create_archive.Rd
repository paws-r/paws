Creates an archive of events with the specified settings. When you
create an archive, incoming events might not immediately start being
sent to the archive. Allow a short period of time for changes to take
effect. If you do not specify a pattern to filter events sent to the
archive, all events are sent to the archive except replayed events.
Replayed events are not sent to an archive.
