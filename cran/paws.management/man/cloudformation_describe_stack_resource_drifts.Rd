drift in the specified stack}
\usage{
cloudformation_describe_stack_resource_drifts(
  StackName,
  StackResourceDriftStatusFilters = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{StackName}{[required] The name of the stack for which you want drift information.}

\item{StackResourceDriftStatusFilters}{The resource drift status values to use as filters for the resource
drift results returned.
\itemize{
\item \code{DELETED}: The resource differs from its expected template
configuration in that the resource has been deleted.
\item \code{MODIFIED}: One or more resource properties differ from their
expected template values.
\item \code{IN_SYNC}: The resource's actual configuration matches its expected
template configuration.
\item \code{NOT_CHECKED}: CloudFormation doesn't currently return this value.
}}

\item{NextToken}{A string that identifies the next page of stack resource drift results.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the
number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes
a \code{NextToken} value that you can assign to the \code{NextToken} request
parameter to get the next set of results.}
}
\description{
