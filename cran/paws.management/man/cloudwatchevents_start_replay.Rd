\usage{
cloudwatchevents_start_replay(ReplayName, Description, EventSourceArn,
  EventStartTime, EventEndTime, Destination)
}
\arguments{
\item{ReplayName}{[required] The name of the replay to start.}

\item{Description}{A description for the replay to start.}

\item{EventSourceArn}{[required] The ARN of the archive to replay events from.}

\item{EventStartTime}{[required] A time stamp for the time to start replaying events. Only events that
occurred between the \code{EventStartTime} and \code{EventEndTime} are replayed.}

\item{EventEndTime}{[required] A time stamp for the time to stop replaying events. Only events that
occurred between the \code{EventStartTime} and \code{EventEndTime} are replayed.}

\item{Destination}{[required] A \code{ReplayDestination} object that includes details about the destination
for the replay.}
}
\value{
A list with the following syntax:\preformatted{list(
  ReplayArn = "string",
  State = "STARTING"|"RUNNING"|"CANCELLING"|"COMPLETED"|"CANCELLED"|"FAILED",
  StateReason = "string",
  ReplayStartTime = as.POSIXct(
    "2015-01-01"
  )
)
}
}
\description{
Starts the specified replay. Events are not necessarily replayed in the
exact same order that they were added to the archive. A replay processes
events to replay based on the time in the event, and replays them using
1 minute intervals. If you specify an \code{EventStartTime} and an
\code{EventEndTime} that covers a 20 minute time range, the events are
replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the
events from the second minute are replayed. You can use
\code{\link[=cloudwatchevents_describe_replay]{describe_replay}} to determine the
progress of a replay. The value returned for \code{EventLastReplayedTime}
indicates the time within the specified time range associated with the
last event replayed.
