\title{Runs an on-demand evaluation for the specified AWS Config rules against
the last known configuration state of the resources}
\usage{
configservice_start_config_rules_evaluation(ConfigRuleNames)
}
\arguments{
\item{ConfigRuleNames}{The list of names of AWS Config rules that you want to run evaluations
for.}
}
\description{
Runs an on-demand evaluation for the specified AWS Config rules against
the last known configuration state of the resources. Use
\code{StartConfigRulesEvaluation} when you want to test that a rule you
updated is working as expected. \code{StartConfigRulesEvaluation} does not
re-record the latest configuration state for your resources. It re-runs
an evaluation against the last known state of your resources.
}
\details{
You can specify up to 25 AWS Config rules per request.

An existing \code{StartConfigRulesEvaluation} call for the specified rules
must complete before you can call the API again. If you chose to have
AWS Config stream to an Amazon SNS topic, you will receive a
\code{ConfigRuleEvaluationStarted} notification when the evaluation starts.

You don\'t need to call the \code{StartConfigRulesEvaluation} API to run an
evaluation for a new rule. When you create a rule, AWS Config evaluates
your resources against the rule automatically.

The \code{StartConfigRulesEvaluation} API is useful if you want to run
on-demand evaluations, such as the following example:
\enumerate{
\item You have a custom rule that evaluates your IAM resources every 24
hours.
\item You update your Lambda function to add additional conditions to your
rule.
\item Instead of waiting for the next periodic evaluation, you call the
\code{StartConfigRulesEvaluation} API.
\item AWS Config invokes your Lambda function and evaluates your IAM
resources.
\item Your custom rule will still run periodic evaluations every 24 hours.
}
