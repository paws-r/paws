\title{Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified EventBridge
resource}
\usage{
cloudwatchevents_tag_resource(ResourceARN, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{ResourceARN}{[required] The ARN of the EventBridge resource that you're adding tags to.}

\item{Tags}{[required] The list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.}
}
\value{
An empty list.
}
\description{
Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified EventBridge
resource. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You
can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user
permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.
In EventBridge, rules and event buses can be tagged.

Tags don't have any semantic meaning to AWS and are interpreted strictly
as strings of characters.

You can use the \code{\link[=cloudwatchevents_tag_resource]{tag_resource}} action
with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key,
this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource.
If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource,
the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that
tag.

You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.
