\title{Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified EventBridge
resource}
\usage{
cloudwatchevents_tag_resource(ResourceARN, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{ResourceARN}{[required] The ARN of the rule that you\'re adding tags to.}

\item{Tags}{[required] The list of key-value pairs to associate with the rule.}
}
\description{
Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified EventBridge
resource. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You
can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user
permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.
In EventBridge, rules can be tagged.
}
\details{
Tags don\'t have any semantic meaning to AWS and are interpreted
strictly as strings of characters.

You can use the \code{TagResource} action with a rule that already has tags.
If you specify a new tag key for the rule, this tag is appended to the
list of tags associated with the rule. If you specify a tag key that is
already associated with the rule, the new tag value that you specify
replaces the previous value for that tag.

You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.
