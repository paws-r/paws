Amazon RDS Performance Insights

Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore
different dimensions of database load based on data captured from a
running DB instance. The guide provides detailed information about
Performance Insights data types, parameters and errors.

When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance
Insights API provides visibility into the performance of your DB
instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for AWS
service-vended monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a
domain-specific view of DB load.

DB load is measured as Average Active Sessions. Performance Insights
provides the data to API consumers as a two-dimensional time-series
dataset. The time dimension provides DB load data for each time point in
the queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall load in
relation to the requested dimensions, measured at that time point.
Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.
