\description{
Returns communications and attachments for one or more support cases.
Use the \code{afterTime} and \code{beforeTime} parameters to filter by date. You
can use the \code{caseId} parameter to restrict the results to a specific
case.
}
\details{
Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was
created more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an
error.

You can use the \code{maxResults} and \code{nextToken} parameters to control the
pagination of the results. Set \code{maxResults} to the number of cases that
you want to display on each page, and use \code{nextToken} to specify the
resumption of pagination.
