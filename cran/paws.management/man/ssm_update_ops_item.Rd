\item{Description}{Update the information about the OpsItem. Provide enough information so
that users reading this OpsItem for the first time understand the issue.}

\item{OperationalData}{Add new keys or edit existing key-value pairs of the OperationalData map
in the OpsItem object.

Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details
about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error
strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data. You
enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum length
of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.

Operational data keys \emph{can't} begin with the following: \code{amazon}, \code{aws},
\code{amzn}, \code{ssm}, \verb{/amazon}, \verb{/aws}, \verb{/amzn}, \verb{/ssm}.

You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the account
or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that all users
with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the
\code{\link[=ssm_describe_ops_items]{describe_ops_items}} API operation) can view
and search on the specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable
is only viewable by users who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by
the \code{\link[=ssm_get_ops_item]{get_ops_item}} API operation).

Use the \verb{/aws/resources} key in OperationalData to specify a related
resource in the request. Use the \verb{/aws/automations} key in
OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To
view Amazon Web Services CLI example commands that use these keys, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-creating-OpsItems.html#OpsCenter-manually-create-OpsItems}{Creating OpsItems manually}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide}.}

\item{OperationalDataToDelete}{Keys that you want to remove from the OperationalData map.}

\item{Notifications}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an SNS topic where notifications are
sent when this OpsItem is edited or changed.}

\item{Priority}{The importance of this OpsItem in relation to other OpsItems in the
system.}

\item{RelatedOpsItems}{One or more OpsItems that share something in common with the current
OpsItems. For example, related OpsItems can include OpsItems with
similar error messages, impacted resources, or statuses for the impacted
resource.}

\item{Status}{The OpsItem status. Status can be \code{Open}, \verb{In Progress}, or \code{Resolved}.

in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide}.}

\item{OpsItemId}{[required] The ID of the OpsItem.}

\item{Title}{A short heading that describes the nature of the OpsItem and the
impacted resource.}

\item{Category}{Specify a new category for an OpsItem.}

\item{Severity}{Specify a new severity for an OpsItem.}

\item{ActualStartTime}{The time a runbook workflow started. Currently reported only for the
OpsItem type \verb{/aws/changerequest}.}

\item{ActualEndTime}{The time a runbook workflow ended. Currently reported only for the
OpsItem type \verb{/aws/changerequest}.}

\item{PlannedStartTime}{The time specified in a change request for a runbook workflow to start.
Currently supported only for the OpsItem type \verb{/aws/changerequest}.}
