}
\value{

to the client. The available operations are listed in the
Operations section.
}
\description{
The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need
detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types.
This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases
programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON
format.
\itemize{
\item You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use the AWS
Support API.
\item If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a
Business or Enterprise support plan, the
\code{SubscriptionRequiredException} error message appears. For
information about changing your support plan, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/}{AWS Support}.
}

The AWS Support service also exposes a set of \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/}{AWS Trusted Advisor}
features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get
check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of
checks.

The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels.}
The \code{\link[=support_describe_services]{describe_services}} and
\code{\link[=support_describe_severity_levels]{describe_severity_levels}}
operations return AWS service names, service codes, service
categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when
you call the \code{\link[=support_create_case]{create_case}} operation.
\item \strong{Case creation, case details, and case resolution.} The
\code{\link[=support_create_case]{create_case}},
\code{\link[=support_describe_cases]{describe_cases}},
\code{\link[=support_describe_attachment]{describe_attachment}}, and
\code{\link[=support_resolve_case]{resolve_case}} operations create AWS Support
cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.
\item \strong{Case communication.} The
\code{\link[=support_describe_communications]{describe_communications}},
\code{\link[=support_add_communication_to_case]{add_communication_to_case}},
and \code{\link[=support_add_attachments_to_set]{add_attachments_to_set}}
operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS
Support cases.
}

The following list describes the operations available from the AWS
Support service for Trusted Advisor:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_checks]{describe_trusted_advisor_checks}}
returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources.
\item Using the \code{checkId} for a specific check returned by
\code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_checks]{describe_trusted_advisor_checks}},
you can call
\code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_check_result]{describe_trusted_advisor_check_result}}
to obtain the results for the check that you specified.
\item \code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_check_summaries]{describe_trusted_advisor_check_summaries}}
returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.
\item \code{\link[=support_refresh_trusted_advisor_check]{refresh_trusted_advisor_check}}
requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check.
\item \code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_check_refresh_statuses]{describe_trusted_advisor_check_refresh_statuses}}
reports the refresh status of one or more checks.
}

For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html}{Signature Version 4 Signing Process}.

See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html}{About the AWS Support API} in
the \emph{AWS Support User Guide} for information about how to use this
service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted
Advisor for results of checks on your resources.
