\arguments{
\item{StackName}{[required] The name or the unique ID of the stack for which you are creating a
change set. CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this
stack's information with the information that you submit, such as a
modified template or different parameter input values.}

\item{TemplateBody}{A structure that contains the body of the revised template, with a
minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes.
CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing this template with
the template of the stack that you specified.

Conditional: You must specify only \code{TemplateBody} or \code{TemplateURL}.}

\item{TemplateURL}{The location of the file that contains the revised template. The URL
must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that's located in an
Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. CloudFormation generates
the change set by comparing this template with the stack that you
specified. The location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start with
\verb{https://}.

Conditional: You must specify only \code{TemplateBody} or \code{TemplateURL}.}

\item{UsePreviousTemplate}{Whether to reuse the template that's associated with the stack to create
the change set.}

\item{Parameters}{A list of \code{Parameter} structures that specify input parameters for the
change set. For more information, see the Parameter data type.}

\item{Capabilities}{In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the
stack.
\itemize{
\item \code{CAPABILITY_IAM} and \code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM}

Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by
creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly
acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.

The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
\code{CAPABILITY_IAM} or \code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM} capability.
\itemize{
\item If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
\item If you have IAM resources with custom names, you \emph{must} specify
\code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM}.
\item If you don't specify either of these capabilities,
CloudFormation returns an \code{InsufficientCapabilities} error.
}

If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you
review all permissions associated with them and edit their
permissions if necessary.

\item \code{CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND}

Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from
the processed template, so that they can review the changes
resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If
your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
create a stack directly from the processed template, without first
reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
acknowledge this capability. This includes the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-include.html}{AWS::Include}
and
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html}{AWS::Serverless}
transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.

This capacity doesn't apply to creating change sets, and specifying
it when creating change sets has no effect.

If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains
macros \emph{and} nested stacks, you must create or update the stack
directly from the template using the
\code{\link[=cloudformation_create_stack]{create_stack}} or
\code{\link[=cloudformation_update_stack]{update_stack}} action, and specifying
this capability.

For more information about macros, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html}{Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros}.
}

Only one of the \code{Capabilities} and \code{ResourceType} parameters can be
specified.}

\item{ResourceTypes}{The template resource types that you have permissions to work with if
you execute this change set, such as \verb{AWS::EC2::Instance},
\verb{AWS::EC2::*}, or \code{Custom::MyCustomInstance}.

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource type that
you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation
grants permissions to all resource types. IAM uses this parameter for
condition keys in IAM policies for CloudFormation. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/control-access-with-iam.html}{Control access with Identity and Access Management}
in the \emph{CloudFormation User Guide}.

Only one of the \code{Capabilities} and \code{ResourceType} parameters can be
specified.}

\item{RoleARN}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation
assumes when executing the change set. CloudFormation uses the role's
credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation uses this role
for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have
permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even
if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role
grants least permission.

If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user
credentials.}

\item{RollbackConfiguration}{The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack
creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring
period afterwards.}

\item{NotificationARNs}{The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon SNS topics that
CloudFormation associates with the stack. To remove all associated
notification topics, specify an empty list.}

\item{Tags}{Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also
propagates these tags to resources in the stack. You can specify a
maximum of 50 tags.}

\item{ChangeSetName}{[required] The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change
sets that are associated with the specified stack.

A change set name can contain only alphanumeric, case sensitive
characters, and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetical character
and can't exceed 128 characters.}

\item{ClientToken}{A unique identifier for this
\code{\link[=cloudformation_create_change_set]{create_change_set}} request. Specify
this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows
that you're not attempting to create another change set with the same
name. You might retry
\code{\link[=cloudformation_create_change_set]{create_change_set}} requests to
ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.}

\item{Description}{A description to help you identify this change set.}

\item{ChangeSetType}{The type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new
stack, specify \code{CREATE}. To create a change set for an existing stack,
specify \code{UPDATE}. To create a change set for an import operation,
specify \code{IMPORT}.

If you create a change set for a new stack, CloudFormation creates a
stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or resources. The stack
will be in the \code{REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS} state until you execute the change
set.

By default, CloudFormation specifies \code{UPDATE}. You can't use the
\code{UPDATE} type to create a change set for a new stack or the \code{CREATE}
type to create a change set for an existing stack.}

\item{ResourcesToImport}{The resources to import into your stack.}

\item{IncludeNestedStacks}{Creates a change set for the all nested stacks specified in the
template. The default behavior of this action is set to \code{False}. To
include nested sets in a change set, specify \code{True}.}

\item{OnStackFailure}{Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. If this
parameter is specified, the \code{DisableRollback} parameter to the
\code{\link[=cloudformation_execute_change_set]{execute_change_set}} API operation
must not be specified. This must be one of these values:
\itemize{
\item \code{DELETE} - Deletes the change set if the stack creation fails. This
is only valid when the \code{ChangeSetType} parameter is set to \code{CREATE}.
If the deletion of the stack fails, the status of the stack is
\code{DELETE_FAILED}.
\item \code{DO_NOTHING} - if the stack creation fails, do nothing. This is
equivalent to specifying \code{true} for the \code{DisableRollback} parameter
to the \code{\link[=cloudformation_execute_change_set]{execute_change_set}} API
operation.
\item \code{ROLLBACK} - if the stack creation fails, roll back the stack. This
is equivalent to specifying \code{false} for the \code{DisableRollback}
parameter to the
\code{\link[=cloudformation_execute_change_set]{execute_change_set}} API
operation.
}

For nested stacks, when the \code{OnStackFailure} parameter is set to
\code{DELETE} for the change set for the parent stack, any failure in a child
stack will cause the parent stack creation to fail and all stacks to be
deleted.}

\item{ImportExistingResources}{Indicates if the change set imports resources that already exist.

This parameter can only import resources that have custom names in
templates. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-name.html}{name type}
in the \emph{CloudFormation User Guide}. To import resources that do not
accept custom names, such as EC2 instances, use the resource import
feature instead. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import.html}{Import Amazon Web Services resources into a CloudFormation stack with a resource import}
in the \emph{CloudFormation User Guide}.}

\description{
Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack.
