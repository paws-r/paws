\description{
Retrieves details about a replay. Use \code{\link[=cloudwatchevents_describe_replay]{describe_replay}} to determine the progress of a running replay. A replay processes events to replay based on the time in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If you use \code{\link[=cloudwatchevents_start_replay]{start_replay}} and specify an \code{EventStartTime} and an \code{EventEndTime} that covers a 20 minute time range, the events are replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the events from the second minute are replayed. You can use \code{\link[=cloudwatchevents_describe_replay]{describe_replay}} to determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for \code{EventLastReplayedTime} indicates the time within the specified time range associated with the last event replayed.
