resourcegroupstaggingapi_get_resources(
  PaginationToken = NULL,
  TagFilters = NULL,

  TagsPerPage = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{PaginationToken}{Specifies a \code{PaginationToken} response value from a previous request to
indicate that you want the next page of results. Leave this parameter
empty in your initial request.}

\item{TagFilters}{Specifies a list of TagFilters (keys and values) to restrict the output
to only those resources that have tags with the specified keys and, if
included, the specified values. Each \code{TagFilter} must contain a key with
values optional. A request can include up to 50 keys, and each key can
include up to 20 values.

Note the following when deciding how to use TagFilters:
\itemize{
\item If you \emph{don't} specify a \code{TagFilter}, the response includes all
resources that are currently tagged or ever had a tag. Resources
that currently don't have tags are shown with an empty tag set, like
this: \verb{"Tags": []}.
\item If you specify more than one filter in a single request, the
response returns only those resources that satisfy all filters.
\item If you specify a filter that contains more than one value for a key,
the response returns resources that match \emph{any} of the specified
values for that key.
\item If you don't specify a value for a key, the response returns all
resources that are tagged with that key, with any or no value.

For example, for the following filters: \verb{filter1= \{keyA,\{value1\}\}},
\verb{filter2=\{keyB,\{value2,value3,value4\}\}}, \code{filter3= {keyC}}:
\itemize{
\item \code{GetResources({filter1})} returns resources tagged with
\code{key1=value1}
\item \code{GetResources({filter2})} returns resources tagged with
\code{key2=value2} or \code{key2=value3} or \code{key2=value4}
\item \code{GetResources({filter3})} returns resources tagged with any tag
with the key \code{key3}, and with any or no value
\item \verb{GetResources(\{filter1,filter2,filter3\})} returns resources
tagged with
\verb{(key1=value1) and (key2=value2 or key2=value3 or key2=value4) and (key3, any or no value)}
}
}}

\item{ResourcesPerPage}{Specifies the maximum number of results to be returned in each page. A
query can return fewer than this maximum, even if there are more results
still to return. You should always check the \code{PaginationToken} response
value to see if there are more results. You can specify a minimum of 1
and a maximum value of 100.}

\item{TagsPerPage}{Amazon Web Services recommends using \code{ResourcesPerPage} instead of this
parameter.

A limit that restricts the number of tags (key and value pairs) returned
by \code{\link[=resourcegroupstaggingapi_get_resources]{get_resources}} in
paginated output. A resource with no tags is counted as having one tag
(one key and value pair).

\code{\link[=resourcegroupstaggingapi_get_resources]{get_resources}} does not split
a resource and its associated tags across pages. If the specified
\code{TagsPerPage} would cause such a break, a \code{PaginationToken} is returned
in place of the affected resource and its tags. Use that token in
another request to get the remaining data. For example, if you specify a
\code{TagsPerPage} of \code{100} and the account has 22 resources with 10 tags
each (meaning that each resource has 10 key and value pairs), the output
will consist of three pages. The first page displays the first 10
resources, each with its 10 tags. The second page displays the next 10
resources, each with its 10 tags. The third page displays the remaining
2 resources, each with its 10 tags.

You can set \code{TagsPerPage} to a minimum of 100 items up to a maximum of
500 items.}

\item{ResourceTypeFilters}{Specifies the resource types that you want included in the response. The
format of each resource type is \verb{service[:resourceType]}. For example,
specifying a resource type of \code{ec2} returns all Amazon EC2 resources
(which includes EC2 instances). Specifying a resource type of
\code{ec2:instance} returns only EC2 instances.

The string for each service name and resource type is the same as that
embedded in a resource's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For the list of
services whose resources you can use in this parameter, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/supported-services.html}{Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API}.

You can specify multiple resource types by using an array. The array can
include up to 100 items. Note that the length constraint requirement
applies to each resource type filter. For example, the following string
would limit the response to only Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3
buckets, or any Audit Manager resource:

\verb{ec2:instance,s3:bucket,auditmanager}}

\item{IncludeComplianceDetails}{Specifies whether to include details regarding the compliance with the
effective tag policy. Set this to \code{true} to determine whether resources
are compliant with the tag policy and to get details.}

\item{ExcludeCompliantResources}{Specifies whether to exclude resources that are compliant with the tag
policy. Set this to \code{true} if you are interested in retrieving
information on noncompliant resources only.

You can use this parameter only if the \code{IncludeComplianceDetails}
parameter is also set to \code{true}.}

\item{ResourceARNList}{Specifies a list of ARNs of resources for which you want to retrieve tag
data. You can't specify both this parameter and any of the pagination
parameters (\code{ResourcesPerPage}, \code{TagsPerPage}, \code{PaginationToken}) in the
same request. If you specify both, you get an \verb{Invalid Parameter}
exception.

If a resource specified by this parameter doesn't exist, it doesn't
generate an error; it simply isn't included in the response.

An ARN (Amazon Resource Name) uniquely identifies a resource. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html}{Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference}.}
