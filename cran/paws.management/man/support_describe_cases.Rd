IDs. In addition, you can filter the cases by date by setting values for

for the \code{includeResolvedCases} and \code{includeCommunications} request
parameters to control how much information is returned.

Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was
created more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an
error.

The response returns the following in JSON format:
\itemize{
\item One or more CaseDetails data types.

returned records represented by the \code{CaseDetails} objects.
}
