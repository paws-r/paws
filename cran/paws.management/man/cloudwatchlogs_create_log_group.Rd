\title{Creates a log group with the specified name}
\usage{
cloudwatchlogs_create_log_group(
  logGroupName,
  kmsKeyId = NULL,
  tags = NULL,
  logGroupClass = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{logGroupName}{[required] A name for the log group.}

\item{kmsKeyId}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use when encrypting log
data. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html#arn-syntax-kms}{Amazon Resource Names}.}

\item{tags}{The key-value pairs to use for the tags.

You can grant users access to certain log groups while preventing them
from accessing other log groups. To do so, tag your groups and use IAM
policies that refer to those tags. To assign tags when you create a log
group, you must have either the \code{logs:TagResource} or \code{logs:TagLogGroup}
permission. For more information about tagging, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html}{Tagging Amazon Web Services resources}.
For more information about using tags to control access, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html}{Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags}.}

\item{logGroupClass}{Use this parameter to specify the log group class for this log group.
There are three classes:
\itemize{
\item The \code{Standard} log class supports all CloudWatch Logs features.
\item The \verb{Infrequent Access} log class supports a subset of CloudWatch
Logs features and incurs lower costs.
\item Use the \code{Delivery} log class only for delivering Lambda logs to
store in Amazon S3 or Amazon Data Firehose. Log events in log groups
in the Delivery class are kept in CloudWatch Logs for only one day.
This log class doesn't offer rich CloudWatch Logs capabilities such
as CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.
}

If you omit this parameter, the default of \code{STANDARD} is used.

The value of \code{logGroupClass} can't be changed after a log group is
created.

For details about the features supported by each class, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch_Logs_Log_Classes.html}{Log classes}}
