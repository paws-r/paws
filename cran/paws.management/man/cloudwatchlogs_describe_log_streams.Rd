\title{Lists the log streams for the specified log group}
\usage{
cloudwatchlogs_describe_log_streams(logGroupName, logStreamNamePrefix,
  orderBy, descending, nextToken, limit)
}
\arguments{
\item{logGroupName}{[required] The name of the log group.}

\item{logStreamNamePrefix}{The prefix to match.

If \code{orderBy} is \code{LastEventTime},you cannot specify this parameter.}

\item{orderBy}{If the value is \code{LogStreamName}, the results are ordered by log stream
name. If the value is \code{LastEventTime}, the results are ordered by the
event time. The default value is \code{LogStreamName}.

If you order the results by event time, you cannot specify the
\code{logStreamNamePrefix} parameter.

lastEventTimestamp represents the time of the most recent log event in
the log stream in CloudWatch Logs. This number is expressed as the
number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
lastEventTimeStamp updates on an eventual consistency basis. It
typically updates in less than an hour from ingestion, but may take
longer in some rare situations.}

\item{descending}{If the value is true, results are returned in descending order. If the
value is to false, results are returned in ascending order. The default
value is false.}

\item{nextToken}{The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token
from a previous call.)}

\item{limit}{The maximum number of items returned. If you don\'t specify a value, the
default is up to 50 items.}
}

This operation has a limit of five transactions per second, after which
transactions are throttled.
