\usage{
ssm_create_maintenance_window(Name, Description, StartDate, EndDate,
  Schedule, ScheduleTimezone, Duration, Cutoff, AllowUnassociatedTargets,
  ClientToken, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name of the maintenance window.}

\item{Description}{An optional description for the maintenance window. We recommend
specifying a description to help you organize your maintenance windows.}

\item{StartDate}{The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the
maintenance window to become active. StartDate allows you to delay
activation of the maintenance window until the specified future date.}

\item{EndDate}{The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the
maintenance window to become inactive. EndDate allows you to set a date
and time in the future when the maintenance window will no longer run.}

\item{Schedule}{[required] The schedule of the maintenance window in the form of a cron or rate
expression.}

\item{ScheduleTimezone}{The time zone that the scheduled maintenance window executions are based
on, in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) format. For example:
\"America/Los\\_Angeles\", \"etc/UTC\", or \"Asia/Seoul\". For more
information, see the \href{https://www.iana.org/time-zones}{Time Zone Database} on the IANA website.}

\item{Duration}{[required] The duration of the maintenance window in hours.}

\item{Cutoff}{[required] The number of hours before the end of the maintenance window that
Systems Manager stops scheduling new tasks for execution.}

\item{AllowUnassociatedTargets}{[required] Enables a maintenance window task to run on managed instances, even if
you have not registered those instances as targets. If enabled, then you
must specify the unregistered instances (by instance ID) when you
register a task with the maintenance window.

If you don\'t enable this option, then you must specify
previously-registered targets when you register a task with the
maintenance window.}

\item{ClientToken}{User-provided idempotency token.}

\item{Tags}{Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to
categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or
environment. For example, you might want to tag a maintenance window to
identify the type of tasks it will run, the types of targets, and the
environment it will run in. In this case, you could specify the
following key name/value pairs:
\itemize{
\item \verb{Key=TaskType,Value=AgentUpdate}
\item \verb{Key=OS,Value=Windows}
\item \verb{Key=Environment,Value=Production}
}

To add tags to an existing maintenance window, use the AddTagsToResource
action.}
}
\description{
Creates a new maintenance window.
}
\details{
The value you specify for \code{Duration} determines the specific end time
for the maintenance window based on the time it begins. No maintenance
window tasks are permitted to start after the resulting endtime minus
the number of hours you specify for \code{Cutoff}. For example, if the
maintenance window starts at 3 PM, the duration is three hours, and the
value you specify for \code{Cutoff} is one hour, no maintenance window tasks
can start after 5 PM.
