\title{Returns a list of audit findings that provide automated analysis of
service behavior and root cause analysis}
\usage{
cloudwatchapplicationsignals_list_audit_findings(
  StartTime,
  EndTime,
  Auditors = NULL,
  AuditTargets,
  DetailLevel = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{StartTime}{[required] The start of the time period to retrieve audit findings for. When used
in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as epoch time in seconds. For
example, \code{1698778057}}

\item{EndTime}{[required] The end of the time period to retrieve audit findings for. When used in
a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as epoch time in seconds. For
example, \code{1698778057}}

\item{Auditors}{A list of auditor names to filter the findings by. Only findings
generated by the specified auditors will be returned.

The following auditors are available for configuration:
\itemize{
\item \code{slo} - SloAuditor: Identifies SLO violations and detects breached
thresholds during the Assessment phase.
\item \code{operation_metric} - OperationMetricAuditor: Detects anomalies in
service operation metrics from Application Signals RED metrics
during the Assessment phase

Anomaly detection is not supported for sparse metrics (those missing
more than 80\% of datapoints within the given time period).
\item \code{service_quota} - ServiceQuotaAuditor: Monitors resource utilization
against service quotas during the Assessment phase
\item \code{trace} - TraceAuditor: Performs deep-dive analysis of distributed
traces, correlating traces with breached SLOs or abnormal RED
metrics during the Analysis phase
\item \code{dependency_metric} - CriticalPathAuditor: Analyzes service
dependency impacts and maps dependency relationships from
Application Signals RED metrics during the Analysis phase
\item \code{top_contributor} - TopContributorAuditor: Identifies
infrastructure-level contributors to issues by analyzing EMF logs of
Application Signals RED metrics during the Analysis phase
\item \code{log} - LogAuditor: Extracts insights from application logs,
categorizing error types and ranking severity by frequency during
the Analysis phase
}

\code{InitAuditor} and \code{Summarizer} auditors are not configurable as they are
automatically triggered during the audit process.}

\item{AuditTargets}{[required] A list of audit targets to filter the findings by. You can specify
services, SLOs, or service operations to limit the audit findings to
specific entities.}

\item{DetailLevel}{The level of details of the audit findings. Supported values: \code{BRIEF},
\code{DETAILED}.}

\item{NextToken}{Include this value, if it was returned by the previous operation, to get
the next set of audit findings.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of audit findings to return in one operation. If you
omit this parameter, the default of 10 is used.}

\description{
Returns a list of audit findings that provide automated analysis of service behavior and root cause analysis. These findings help identify the most significant observations about your services, including performance issues, anomalies, and potential problems. The findings are generated using heuristic algorithms based on established troubleshooting patterns.
