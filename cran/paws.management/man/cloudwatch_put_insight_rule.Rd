\title{Creates a Contributor Insights rule}
\usage{
cloudwatch_put_insight_rule(RuleName, RuleState, RuleDefinition, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{RuleName}{[required] A unique name for the rule.}

\item{RuleState}{The state of the rule. Valid values are ENABLED and DISABLED.}

\item{RuleDefinition}{[required] The definition of the rule, as a JSON object. For details on the valid
syntax, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContributorInsights-RuleSyntax.html}{Contributor Insights Rule Syntax}.}

\item{Tags}{A list of key-value pairs to associate with the Contributor Insights
rule. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a rule.

Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also
use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to
access or change only the resources that have certain tag values.

To be able to associate tags with a rule, you must have the
\code{cloudwatch:TagResource} permission in addition to the
\code{cloudwatch:PutInsightRule} permission.

If you are using this operation to update an existing Contributor
Insights rule, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To
change the tags of an existing rule, use
\code{\link[=cloudwatch_tag_resource]{tag_resource}}.}
}
\description{
Creates a Contributor Insights rule. Rules evaluate log events in a
CloudWatch Logs log group, enabling you to find contributor data for the
log events in that log group. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContributorInsights.html}{Using Contributor Insights to Analyze High-Cardinality Data}.

If you create a rule, delete it, and then re-create it with the same
name, historical data from the first time the rule was created might not
be available.
