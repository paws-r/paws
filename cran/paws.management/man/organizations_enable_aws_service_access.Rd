\title{Enables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified
by ServicePrincipal) with AWS Organizations}
\usage{
organizations_enable_aws_service_access(ServicePrincipal)
}
\arguments{
\item{ServicePrincipal}{[required] The service principal name of the AWS service for which you want to
enable integration with your organization. This is typically in the form
of a URL, such as \verb{ <i>service-abbreviation</i>.amazonaws.com}.}
}
\description{
Enables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified
by \code{ServicePrincipal}) with AWS Organizations. When you enable
integration, you allow the specified service to create a \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html}{service-linked role}
in all the accounts in your organization. This allows the service to
perform operations on your behalf in your organization and its accounts.
}
\details{
We recommend that you enable integration between AWS Organizations and
the specified AWS service by using the console or commands that are
provided by the specified service. Doing so ensures that the service is
aware that it can create the resources that are required for the
integration. How the service creates those resources in the
organization\'s accounts depends on that service. For more information,
see the documentation for the other AWS service.

For more information about enabling services to integrate with AWS
Organizations, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html}{Integrating AWS Organizations with Other AWS Services}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}

This operation can be called only from the organization\'s master
account and only if the organization has \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html}{enabled all features}.
