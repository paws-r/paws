\description{
Returns a list of accounts in the organization from AWS Organizations
that are affected by the provided event. For more information about the
different types of AWS Health events, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html}{Event}.

Before you can call this operation, you must first enable AWS Health to
work with AWS Organizations. To do this, call the
\code{\link[=health_enable_health_service_access_for_organization]{enable_health_service_access_for_organization}}
operation from your organization's master account.

This API operation uses pagination. Specify the \code{nextToken} parameter in
the next request to return more results.
