cloudwatchlogs_filter_log_events(
  logGroupName = NULL,
  logGroupIdentifier = NULL,
  logStreamNames = NULL,
  logStreamNamePrefix = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{logGroupName}{The name of the log group to search.

You must include either \code{logGroupIdentifier} or \code{logGroupName}, but not
both.}

\item{logGroupIdentifier}{Specify either the name or ARN of the log group to view log events from.
If the log group is in a source account and you are using a monitoring
account, you must use the log group ARN.

You must include either \code{logGroupIdentifier} or \code{logGroupName}, but not
both.}

\item{logStreamNames}{Filters the results to only logs from the log streams in this list.

If you specify a value for both \code{logStreamNames} and
\code{logStreamNamePrefix}, the action returns an \code{InvalidParameterException}
error.}

\item{logStreamNamePrefix}{Filters the results to include only events from log streams that have
names starting with this prefix.

If you specify a value for both \code{logStreamNamePrefix} and
\code{logStreamNames}, the action returns an \code{InvalidParameterException}
error.}

\item{startTime}{The start of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds
after \verb{Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC}. Events with a timestamp before this
time are not returned.}

\item{endTime}{The end of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds after
\verb{Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC}. Events with a timestamp later than this time
are not returned.}

\item{filterPattern}{The filter pattern to use. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html}{Filter and Pattern Syntax}.

If not provided, all the events are matched.}

\item{nextToken}{The token for the next set of events to return. (You received this token
from a previous call.)}

\item{limit}{The maximum number of events to return. The default is 10,000 events.}

\item{interleaved}{If the value is true, the operation attempts to provide responses that
contain events from multiple log streams within the log group,
interleaved in a single response. If the value is false, all the matched
log events in the first log stream are searched first, then those in the
next log stream, and so on.

\strong{Important} As of June 17, 2019, this parameter is ignored and the
value is assumed to be true. The response from this operation always
interleaves events from multiple log streams within a log group.}

\item{unmask}{Specify \code{true} to display the log event fields with all sensitive data
unmasked and visible. The default is \code{false}.

To use this operation with this parameter, you must be signed into an
account with the \code{logs:Unmask} permission.}
