\title{Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or
account}
\usage{
organizations_detach_policy(PolicyId, TargetId)
}
\arguments{
\item{PolicyId}{[required] The unique identifier (ID) of the policy you want to detach. You can get
the ID from the ListPolicies or ListPoliciesForTarget operations.

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} for a policy ID
string requires \"p-\" followed by from 8 to 128 lowercase letters or
digits.}

\item{TargetId}{[required] The unique identifier (ID) of the root, OU, or account that you want to
detach the policy from. You can get the ID from the ListRoots,
ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent, or ListAccounts operations.

The \href{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex}{regex pattern} for a target ID
string requires one of the following:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Root} - A string that begins with \"r-\" followed by from 4 to 32
lowercase letters or digits.
\item \strong{Account} - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.
\item \strong{Organizational unit (OU)} - A string that begins with \"ou-\"
followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the
root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a second \"-\"
dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.
}}
}
\description{
Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or
account. If the policy being detached is a service control policy (SCP),
the changes to permissions for IAM users and roles in affected accounts
are immediate.
}
\details{
\strong{Note:} Every root, OU, and account must have at least one SCP
attached. You can replace the default \code{FullAWSAccess} policy with one
that limits the permissions that can be delegated. To do that, you must
attach the replacement policy before you can remove the default one.
This is the authorization strategy of using an \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html#orgs_policies_whitelist}{allow list}.
You could instead attach a second SCP and leave the \code{FullAWSAccess} SCP
still attached. You could then specify \code{"Effect": "Deny"} in the second
SCP to override the \code{"Effect": "Allow"} in the \code{FullAWSAccess} policy
(or any other attached SCP). If you take these steps, you\'re using the
authorization strategy of a \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html#orgs_policies_blacklist}{deny list}.

This operation can be called only from the organization\'s master
account.
