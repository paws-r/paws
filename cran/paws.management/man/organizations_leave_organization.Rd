\title{Removes a member account from its parent organization}
\usage{
organizations_leave_organization()
}
\description{
Removes a member account from its parent organization. This version of
the operation is performed by the account that wants to leave. To remove
a member account as a user in the master account, use
RemoveAccountFromOrganization instead.
}
\details{
This operation can be called only from a member account in the
organization.
\itemize{
\item The master account in an organization with all features enabled can
set service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what
administrators of member accounts can do. These restrictions can
include preventing member accounts from successfully calling
\code{LeaveOrganization}.
\item You can leave an organization as a member account only if the
account is configured with the information required to operate as a
standalone account. When you create an account in an organization
using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI, the information
required of standalone accounts is \emph{not} automatically collected.
For each account that you want to make standalone, you must accept
the end user license agreement (EULA). You must also choose a
support plan, provide and verify the required contact information,
and provide a current payment method. AWS uses the payment method to
charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS activity that occurs
while the account isn\'t attached to an organization. Follow the
steps at \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info}{To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}
\item You can leave an organization only after you enable IAM user access
to billing in your account. For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate}{Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console}
in the \emph{AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.}
