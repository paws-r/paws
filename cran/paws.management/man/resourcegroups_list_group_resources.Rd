\title{Returns a list of ARNs of the resources that are members of a specified
resource group}
\usage{
resourcegroups_list_group_resources(GroupName, Group, Filters,
  MaxResults, NextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{GroupName}{\emph{\strong{Deprecated - don't use this parameter. Use the \code{Group} request field
instead.}}}

\item{Group}{The name or the ARN of the resource group}

\item{Filters}{Filters, formatted as ResourceFilter objects, that you want to apply to
a \code{\link[=resourcegroups_list_group_resources]{list_group_resources}}
operation. Filters the results to include only those of the specified
resource types.
\itemize{
\item \code{resource-type} - Filter resources by their type. Specify up to five
resource types in the format \verb{AWS::ServiceCode::ResourceType}. For
example, \verb{AWS::EC2::Instance}, or \verb{AWS::S3::Bucket}.
}

When you specify a \code{resource-type} filter for
\code{\link[=resourcegroups_list_group_resources]{list_group_resources}}, AWS
Resource Groups validates your filter resource types against the types
that are defined in the query associated with the group. For example, if
a group contains only S3 buckets because its query specifies only that
resource type, but your \code{resource-type} filter includes EC2 instances,
AWS Resource Groups does not filter for EC2 instances. In this case, a
\code{\link[=resourcegroups_list_group_resources]{list_group_resources}} request
returns a \code{BadRequestException} error with a message similar to the
following:

\verb{The resource types specified as filters in the request are not valid.}

The error includes a list of resource types that failed the validation
because they are not part of the query associated with the group. This
validation doesn't occur when the group query specifies
\code{AWS::AllSupported}, because a group based on such a query can contain
any of the allowed resource types for the query type (tag-based or AWS
CloudFormation stack-based queries).}

\item{MaxResults}{The total number of results that you want included on each page of the
response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value
that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the
maximum you specify, the \code{NextToken} response element is present and has
a value (is not null). Include that value as the \code{NextToken} request
parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the
results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the
maximum even when there are more results available. You should check
\code{NextToken} after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the
results.}

\item{NextToken}{The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a
\code{NextToken} response in a previous request. A \code{NextToken} response
indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value
provided by a previous call's \code{NextToken} response to indicate where the
output should continue from.}
