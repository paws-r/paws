\item{Description}{An optional description for the update request.}

\item{StartDate}{The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the
maintenance window to become active. \code{StartDate} allows you to delay
activation of the maintenance window until the specified future date.}

\item{EndDate}{The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the

date and time in the future when the maintenance window will no longer

expression.}

\item{ScheduleTimezone}{The time zone that the scheduled maintenance window executions are based
on, in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) format. For example:

expression before running the maintenance window.

For example, the following cron expression schedules a maintenance
window to run the third Tuesday of every month at 11:30 PM.

\verb{cron(30 23 ? * TUE#3 *)}

If the schedule offset is \code{2}, the maintenance window won't run until
two days later.}
