)
}
\arguments{
\item{InstanceInformationFilterList}{This is a legacy method. We recommend that you don't use this method.
Instead, use the \code{Filters} data type. \code{Filters} enables you to return
node information by filtering based on tags applied to managed nodes.

Attempting to use \code{InstanceInformationFilterList} and \code{Filters} leads to
an exception error.}

\item{Filters}{One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of
managed nodes. You can filter based on tags applied to EC2 instances.
Use this \code{Filters} data type instead of \code{InstanceInformationFilterList},
which is deprecated.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of items to return for this call. The call also
returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the
next set of results.}

\item{NextToken}{The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token
from a previous call.)}
