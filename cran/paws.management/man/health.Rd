\description{
AWS Health

The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health
information that appears in the \href{https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/}{AWS Personal Health Dashboard}. You can use the API
operations to get information about AWS Health events that affect your
AWS services and resources.

You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan from \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/}{AWS Support} to use the AWS Health
API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account that doesn't
have a Business or Enterprise support plan, you receive a
\code{SubscriptionRequiredException} error.

AWS Health has a single endpoint: health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
(HTTPS). Use this endpoint to call the AWS Health API operations.

For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html}{Signature Version 4 Signing Process}.

If your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS
Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized
view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You
can aggregate AWS Health events in real time to identify accounts in
your organization that are affected by an operational event or get
notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API
operations to enable this feature and return event information. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html}{Aggregating AWS Health events}
in the \emph{AWS Health User Guide}.

When you use the AWS Health API operations to return AWS Health events,
see the following recommendations:
\itemize{
\item Use the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode}{eventScopeCode}
parameter to specify whether to return AWS Health events that are
public or account-specific.
\item Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if
you call the
\code{\link[=health_describe_events_for_organization]{describe_events_for_organization}}
operation to get all events in your organization, you might receive
several page results. Specify the \code{nextToken} in the next request to
return more results.
