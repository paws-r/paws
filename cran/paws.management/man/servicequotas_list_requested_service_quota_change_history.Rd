\title{Requests a list of the changes to quotas for a service}
\usage{
servicequotas_list_requested_service_quota_change_history(ServiceCode,
  Status, NextToken, MaxResults)
}
\arguments{
\item{ServiceCode}{Specifies the service that you want to use.}

\item{Status}{Specifies the status value of the quota increase request.}

\item{NextToken}{(Optional) Use this parameter in a request if you receive a \code{NextToken}
response in a previous request that indicates that there\'s more output
available. In a subsequent call, set it to the value of the previous
call\'s \code{NextToken} response to indicate where the output should
continue from.}

\item{MaxResults}{(Optional) Limits the number of results that you want to include in the
response. If you don\'t include this parameter, the response defaults to
a value that\'s specific to the operation. If additional items exist
beyond the specified maximum, the \code{NextToken} element is present and has
a value (isn\'t null). Include that value as the \code{NextToken} request
parameter in the call to the operation to get the next part of the
results. You should check \code{NextToken} after every operation to ensure
that you receive all of the results.}
