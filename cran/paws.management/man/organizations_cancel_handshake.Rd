\description{
Cancels a handshake. Canceling a handshake sets the handshake state to
\code{CANCELED}.

This operation can be called only from the account that originated the
handshake. The recipient of the handshake can't cancel it, but can use
\code{\link[=organizations_decline_handshake]{decline_handshake}} instead. After a
handshake is canceled, the recipient can no longer respond to that
handshake.

After you cancel a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of
relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.
