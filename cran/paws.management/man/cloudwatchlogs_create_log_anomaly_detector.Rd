\title{Creates an anomaly detector that regularly scans one or more log groups
and look for patterns and anomalies in the logs}
\usage{
cloudwatchlogs_create_log_anomaly_detector(
  logGroupArnList,
  detectorName = NULL,
  evaluationFrequency = NULL,
  filterPattern = NULL,
  kmsKeyId = NULL,
  anomalyVisibilityTime = NULL,
  tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{logGroupArnList}{[required] An array containing the ARN of the log group that this anomaly detector
will watch. You can specify only one log group ARN.}

\item{detectorName}{A name for this anomaly detector.}

\item{evaluationFrequency}{Specifies how often the anomaly detector is to run and look for
anomalies. Set this value according to the frequency that the log group
receives new logs. For example, if the log group receives new log events
every 10 minutes, then 15 minutes might be a good setting for
\code{evaluationFrequency} .}

\item{filterPattern}{You can use this parameter to limit the anomaly detection model to
examine only log events that match the pattern you specify here. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html}{Filter and Pattern Syntax}.}

\item{kmsKeyId}{Optionally assigns a KMS key to secure this anomaly detector and its
findings. If a key is assigned, the anomalies found and the model used
by this detector are encrypted at rest with the key. If a key is
assigned to an anomaly detector, a user must have permissions for both
this key and for the anomaly detector to retrieve information about the
anomalies that it finds.

Make sure the value provided is a valid KMS key ARN. For more
information about using a KMS key and to see the required IAM policy,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/LogsAnomalyDetection-KMS.html}{Use a KMS key with an anomaly detector}.}

\item{anomalyVisibilityTime}{The number of days to have visibility on an anomaly. After this time
period has elapsed for an anomaly, it will be automatically baselined
and the anomaly detector will treat new occurrences of a similar anomaly
as normal. Therefore, if you do not correct the cause of an anomaly
during the time period specified in \code{anomalyVisibilityTime}, it will be
considered normal going forward and will not be detected as an anomaly.}

\item{tags}{An optional list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

For more information about tagging, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html}{Tagging Amazon Web Services resources}}
