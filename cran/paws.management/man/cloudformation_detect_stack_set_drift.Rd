Detect drift on a StackSet. When CloudFormation performs drift detection on a StackSet, it performs drift detection on the stack associated with each stack instance in the StackSet. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-drift.html}{Performing drift detection on CloudFormation StackSets}.
