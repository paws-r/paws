\arguments{
\item{StackName}{[required] The name or unique stack ID of the stack to update.}

\item{TemplateBody}{Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte
and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes.

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
\code{TemplateBody}, \code{TemplateURL}, or set the \code{UsePreviousTemplate} to
\code{true}.}

\item{TemplateURL}{Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a
template that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager
document. The location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start with
\verb{https://}.

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
\code{TemplateBody}, \code{TemplateURL}, or set the \code{UsePreviousTemplate} to
\code{true}.}

\item{UsePreviousTemplate}{Reuse the existing template that is associated with the stack that you
are updating.

Conditional: You must specify only one of the following parameters:
\code{TemplateBody}, \code{TemplateURL}, or set the \code{UsePreviousTemplate} to
\code{true}.}

\item{StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody}{Structure containing the temporary overriding stack policy body. You can
specify either the \code{StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody} or the
\code{StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL} parameter, but not both.

If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary
overriding stack policy during this update. If you don't specify a stack
policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be
used.}

\item{StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL}{Location of a file containing the temporary overriding stack policy. The
URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in
the same Region as the stack. The location for an Amazon S3 bucket must
start with \verb{https://}. You can specify either the
\code{StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody} or the \code{StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL}
parameter, but not both.

If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary
overriding stack policy during this update. If you don't specify a stack
policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be
used.}

\item{Parameters}{A list of \code{Parameter} structures that specify input parameters for the
stack. For more information, see the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html}{Parameter}
data type.}

\item{Capabilities}{In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template
contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to update the
stack.
\itemize{
\item \code{CAPABILITY_IAM} and \code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM}

Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
permissions in your Amazon Web Services account, for example, by
creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly
acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.

The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
\code{CAPABILITY_IAM} or \code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM} capability.
\itemize{
\item If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
\item If you have IAM resources with custom names, you \emph{must} specify
\code{CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM}.
\item If you don't specify either of these capabilities,
CloudFormation returns an \code{InsufficientCapabilities} error.
}

If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you
review all permissions associated with them and edit their
permissions if necessary.

\item \code{CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND}

Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from
the processed template, so that they can review the changes
resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If
your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
update a stack directly from the processed template, without first
reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
acknowledge this capability. This includes the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-include.html}{AWS::Include}
and
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html}{AWS::Serverless}
transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.

If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains
macros \emph{and} nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from
the template using this capability.

You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that
contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.

Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for
processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner
can update the function operation without CloudFormation being
notified.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html}{Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros}.
}

Only one of the \code{Capabilities} and \code{ResourceType} parameters can be
specified.}

\item{ResourceTypes}{The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for
this update stack action, such as \verb{AWS::EC2::Instance}, \verb{AWS::EC2::*},
or \code{Custom::MyCustomInstance}.

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're
updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants
permissions to all resource types. IAM uses this parameter for
CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/control-access-with-iam.html}{Control access with Identity and Access Management}.

Only one of the \code{Capabilities} and \code{ResourceType} parameters can be
specified.}

\item{RoleARN}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation
assumes to update the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's credentials
to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for
all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission
to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users
don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least
privilege.

If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user
credentials.}

\item{RollbackConfiguration}{The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack
creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring
period afterwards.}

\item{StackPolicyBody}{Structure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either the
\code{StackPolicyBody} or the \code{StackPolicyURL} parameter, but not both.

You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a
new resource that you created during a stack update. If you don't
specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the
stack is unchanged.}

\item{StackPolicyURL}{Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must
point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same
Region as the stack. The location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start
with \verb{https://}. You can specify either the \code{StackPolicyBody} or the
\code{StackPolicyURL} parameter, but not both.

You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a
new resource that you created during a stack update. If you don't
specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the
stack is unchanged.}

\item{NotificationARNs}{Amazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
that CloudFormation associates with the stack. Specify an empty list to
remove all notification topics.}

\item{Tags}{Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also
propagates these tags to supported resources in the stack. You can
specify a maximum number of 50 tags.

If you don't specify this parameter, CloudFormation doesn't modify the
stack's tags. If you specify an empty value, CloudFormation removes all
associated tags.}

\item{DisableRollback}{Preserve the state of previously provisioned resources when an operation
fails.

Default: \code{False}}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{A unique identifier for this
\code{\link[=cloudformation_update_stack]{update_stack}} request. Specify this
token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that
you're not attempting to update a stack with the same name. You might
retry \code{\link[=cloudformation_update_stack]{update_stack}} requests to ensure
that CloudFormation successfully received them.

All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same
client request token, which you can use to track operations. For
example, if you execute a \code{\link[=cloudformation_create_stack]{create_stack}}
operation with the token \code{token1}, then all the \code{StackEvents} generated
by that operation will have \code{ClientRequestToken} set as \code{token1}.

In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the
Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the
token format \emph{Console-StackOperation-ID}, which helps you easily
identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using
the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the
following format:
\verb{Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002}.}

\item{RetainExceptOnCreate}{When set to \code{true}, newly created resources are deleted when the
operation rolls back. This includes newly created resources marked with
a deletion policy of \code{Retain}.

Default: \code{false}}
