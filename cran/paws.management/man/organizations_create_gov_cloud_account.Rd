\title{This action is available if all of the following are true:}
\usage{
organizations_create_gov_cloud_account(Email, AccountName, RoleName,
  IamUserAccessToBilling, Tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{Email}{[required] The email address of the owner to assign to the new member account in
the commercial Region. This email address must not already be associated
with another AWS account. You must use a valid email address to complete
account creation. You can't access the root user of the account or
remove an account that was created with an invalid email address. Like
all request parameters for
\code{\link[=organizations_create_gov_cloud_account]{create_gov_cloud_account}},
the request for the email address for the AWS GovCloud (US) account
originates from the commercial Region, not from the AWS GovCloud (US)
Region.}

\item{AccountName}{[required] The friendly name of the member account.}

\item{RoleName}{(Optional)

The name of an IAM role that AWS Organizations automatically
preconfigures in the new member accounts in both the AWS GovCloud (US)
Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the management
account, allowing users in the management account to assume the role, as
permitted by the management account administrator. The role has
administrator permissions in the new member account.

If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to
\code{OrganizationAccountAccessRole}.

For more information about how to use this role to access the member
account, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role}{Accessing and Administering the Member Accounts in Your Organization}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide} and steps 2 and 3 in \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html}{Tutorial: Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using IAM Roles}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide.}

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern} that is used to
validate this parameter. The pattern can include uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, digits with no spaces, and any of the following
characters: =,.@-}

\item{IamUserAccessToBilling}{If set to \code{ALLOW}, the new linked account in the commercial Region
enables IAM users to access account billing information \emph{if} they have
the required permissions. If set to \code{DENY}, only the root user of the
new account can access account billing information. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/control-access-billing.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate}{Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console}
in the \emph{AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.}

If you don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to \code{ALLOW}, and
IAM users and roles with the required permissions can access billing
information for the new account.}

\item{Tags}{A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created account.
These tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the
GovCloud account, and not to the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to
the actual GovCloud account, call the
\code{\link[=organizations_tag_resource]{tag_resource}} operation in the GovCloud
region after the new GovCloud account exists.

For each tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key and a value.
You can set the value to an empty string, but you can't set it to
\code{null}. For more information about tagging, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tagging.html}{Tagging AWS Organizations resources}
in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed number of
tags for an account, then the entire request fails and the account is
not created.}
}
\value{
A list with the following syntax:\preformatted{list(
  CreateAccountStatus = list(
    Id = "string",
    AccountName = "string",
    State = "IN_PROGRESS"|"SUCCEEDED"|"FAILED",
    RequestedTimestamp = as.POSIXct(

  )
)
}
}
\description{
This action is available if all of the following are true:
\itemize{
\item You're authorized to create accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US)
Region. For more information on the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, see
the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/welcome.html}{\emph{AWS GovCloud User Guide}.}
\item You already have an account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region that is
paired with a management account of an organization in the
commercial Region.
\item You call this action from the management account of your
organization in the commercial Region.
\item You have the \code{organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount} permission.
}

AWS Organizations automatically creates the required service-linked role
named \code{AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations}. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs}{AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}

AWS automatically enables AWS CloudTrail for AWS GovCloud (US) accounts,
but you should also do the following:
\itemize{
\item Verify that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.
\item Create an S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail log storage.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/verifying-cloudtrail.html}{Verifying AWS CloudTrail Is Enabled}
in the \emph{AWS GovCloud User Guide}.
}

If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
\code{organizations:TagResource} permission. The tags are attached to the
commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the
GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the
\code{\link[=organizations_tag_resource]{tag_resource}} operation in the GovCloud
Region after the new GovCloud account exists.

You call this action from the management account of your organization in
the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS
GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management
account of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite it
to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone
accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html}{AWS Organizations}
in the \emph{AWS GovCloud User Guide.}

Calling
\code{\link[=organizations_create_gov_cloud_account]{create_gov_cloud_account}} is
an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because
\code{\link[=organizations_create_gov_cloud_account]{create_gov_cloud_account}}
operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message
even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might
need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the
account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:
\itemize{
\item Use the \code{OperationId} response element from this operation to
provide as a parameter to the
\code{\link[=organizations_describe_create_account_status]{describe_create_account_status}}
operation.
\item Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the \code{CreateAccountResult} event.
For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/}{Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}
}

When you call the
\code{\link[=organizations_create_gov_cloud_account]{create_gov_cloud_account}}
action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the AWS
GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region
for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region
is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the
request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address.

A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that
allows the management account in the organization in the commercial
Region to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and
associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is
also created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by
the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management
account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view
a diagram that explains how account access works, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html}{AWS Organizations}
in the \emph{AWS GovCloud User Guide.}

For more information about creating accounts, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html}{Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}
\itemize{
\item When you create an account in an organization using the AWS
Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information
required for the account to operate as a standalone account is \emph{not}
automatically collected. This includes a payment method and signing
the end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove an account
from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide
the missing information. Follow the steps at \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info}{To leave an organization as a member account}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}
\item If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
account limits for the organization, contact AWS Support.
\item If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
then try again. If the error persists, contact AWS Support.
\item Using
\code{\link[=organizations_create_gov_cloud_account]{create_gov_cloud_account}}
to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can
only close an account from the AWS Billing and Cost Management
console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information
on the requirements and process for closing an account, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html}{Closing an AWS Account}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide}.
}

When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
whether to create the account with the \strong{IAM User and Role Access to
Billing Information} switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and
roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for
the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access
billing information. For information about how to disable this switch
for an account, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/control-access-billing.html}{Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools}.
