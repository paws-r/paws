\value{
A client for the service. You can call the service's operations using
syntax like \code{svc$operation(...)}, where \code{svc} is the name you've assigned
to the client. The available operations are listed in the
Operations section.

\description{
Use CloudWatch Application Signals for comprehensive observability of
your cloud-based applications. It enables real-time service health
dashboards and helps you track long-term performance trends against your
business goals. The application-centric view provides you with unified
visibility across your applications, services, and dependencies, so you
can proactively monitor and efficiently triage any issues that may
arise, ensuring optimal customer experience.

Application Signals provides the following benefits:
\itemize{
\item Automatically collect metrics and traces from your applications, and
display key metrics such as call volume, availability, latency,
faults, and errors.
\item Create and monitor service level objectives (SLOs).
\item See a map of your application topology that Application Signals
automatically discovers, that gives you a visual representation of
your applications, dependencies, and their connectivity.
}

Application Signals works with CloudWatch RUM, CloudWatch Synthetics
canaries, and Amazon Web Services Service Catalog AppRegistry, to
display your client pages, Synthetics canaries, and application names
within dashboards and maps.
