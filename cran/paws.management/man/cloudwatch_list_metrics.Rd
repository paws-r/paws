\title{List the specified metrics}
\usage{
cloudwatch_list_metrics(Namespace, MetricName, Dimensions, NextToken,
  RecentlyActive)
}
\arguments{
\item{Namespace}{The metric namespace to filter against. Only the namespace that matches
exactly will be returned.}

\item{MetricName}{The name of the metric to filter against. Only the metrics with names
that match exactly will be returned.}

\item{Dimensions}{The dimensions to filter against. Only the dimensions that match exactly
will be returned.}

\item{NextToken}{The token returned by a previous call to indicate that there is more
data available.}

\item{RecentlyActive}{To filter the results to show only metrics that have had data points
published in the past three hours, specify this parameter with a value
of \code{PT3H}. This is the only valid value for this parameter.

The results that are returned are an approximation of the value you
specify. There is a low probability that the returned results include
metrics with last published data as much as 40 minutes more than the
specified time interval.}
}
\value{
A list with the following syntax:\preformatted{list(
  Metrics = list(
    list(
      Namespace = "string",
      MetricName = "string",
      Dimensions = list(
        list(
          Name = "string",
          Value = "string"
        )
      )
    )
  ),
  NextToken = "string"
)
}
}
\description{
List the specified metrics. You can use the returned metrics with
\code{\link[=cloudwatch_get_metric_data]{get_metric_data}} or
\code{\link[=cloudwatch_get_metric_statistics]{get_metric_statistics}} to obtain
statistical data.

Up to 500 results are returned for any one call. To retrieve additional
results, use the returned token with subsequent calls.

After you create a metric, allow up to 15 minutes before the metric
appears. You can see statistics about the metric sooner by using
\code{\link[=cloudwatch_get_metric_data]{get_metric_data}} or
\code{\link[=cloudwatch_get_metric_statistics]{get_metric_statistics}}.

\code{\link[=cloudwatch_list_metrics]{list_metrics}} doesn't return information
about metrics if those metrics haven't reported data in the past two
weeks. To retrieve those metrics, use
\code{\link[=cloudwatch_get_metric_data]{get_metric_data}} or
\code{\link[=cloudwatch_get_metric_statistics]{get_metric_statistics}}.
