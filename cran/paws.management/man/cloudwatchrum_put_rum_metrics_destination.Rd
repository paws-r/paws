\usage{
cloudwatchrum_put_rum_metrics_destination(
  AppMonitorName,
  Destination,
  DestinationArn = NULL,
  IamRoleArn = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{AppMonitorName}{[required] The name of the CloudWatch RUM app monitor that will send the metrics.}

\item{Destination}{[required] Defines the destination to send the metrics to. Valid values are
\code{CloudWatch} and \code{Evidently}. If you specify \code{Evidently}, you must also
specify the ARN of the CloudWatchEvidently experiment that is to be the
destination and an IAM role that has permission to write to the
experiment.}

\item{DestinationArn}{Use this parameter only if \code{Destination} is \code{Evidently}. This parameter
specifies the ARN of the Evidently experiment that will receive the
extended metrics.}

\item{IamRoleArn}{This parameter is required if \code{Destination} is \code{Evidently}. If
\code{Destination} is \code{CloudWatch}, do not use this parameter.

This parameter specifies the ARN of an IAM role that RUM will assume to
write to the Evidently experiment that you are sending metrics to. This
role must have permission to write to that experiment.}
