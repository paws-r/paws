\usage{
organizations_disable_policy_type(RootId, PolicyType)
}
\arguments{
\item{RootId}{[required] The unique identifier (ID) of the root in which you want to disable a
policy type. You can get the ID from the
\code{\link[=organizations_list_roots]{list_roots}} operation.

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern} for a root ID
string requires "r-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or
digits.}

\item{PolicyType}{[required] The policy type that you want to disable in this root. You can specify
one of the following values:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out.html}{AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY}
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_backup.html}{BACKUP_POLICY}
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html}{SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY}

\value{
A list with the following syntax:\preformatted{list(
  Root = list(
    Id = "string",
    Arn = "string",
    Name = "string",
    PolicyTypes = list(
      list(
        Type = "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"|"TAG_POLICY"|"BACKUP_POLICY"|"AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY",
        Status = "ENABLED"|"PENDING_ENABLE"|"PENDING_DISABLE"
      )
    )
  )
)

\description{
Disables an organizational policy type in a root. A policy of a certain
type can be attached to entities in a root only if that type is enabled
in the root. After you perform this operation, you no longer can attach
policies of the specified type to that root or to any organizational
unit (OU) or account in that root. You can undo this by using the
\code{\link[=organizations_enable_policy_type]{enable_policy_type}} operation.

This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. If
you disable a policy type for a root, it still appears enabled for the
organization if \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html}{all features}
are enabled for the organization. AWS recommends that you first use
\code{\link[=organizations_list_roots]{list_roots}} to see the status of policy
types for a specified root, and then use this operation.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management
account.

To view the status of available policy types in the organization, use
\code{\link[=organizations_describe_organization]{describe_organization}}.
