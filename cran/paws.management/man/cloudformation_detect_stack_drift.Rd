\title{Detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has
\emph{drifted}, from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack
template and any values specified as template parameters}
\usage{
cloudformation_detect_stack_drift(StackName, LogicalResourceIds)
}
\arguments{
\item{StackName}{[required] The name of the stack for which you want to detect drift.}

\item{LogicalResourceIds}{The logical names of any resources you want to use as filters.}
}
\description{
Detects whether a stack\'s actual configuration differs, or has
\emph{drifted}, from it\'s expected configuration, as defined in the stack
template and any values specified as template parameters. For each
resource in the stack that supports drift detection, AWS CloudFormation
compares the actual configuration of the resource with its expected
template configuration. Only resource properties explicitly defined in
the stack template are checked for drift. A stack is considered to have
drifted if one or more of its resources differ from their expected
template configurations. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html}{Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources}.
}
\details{
Use \code{DetectStackDrift} to detect drift on all supported resources for a
given stack, or DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual
resources.

For a list of stack resources that currently support drift detection,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift-resource-list.html}{Resources that Support Drift Detection}.

\code{DetectStackDrift} can take up to several minutes, depending on the
number of resources contained within the stack. Use
DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus to monitor the progress of a detect
stack drift operation. Once the drift detection operation has completed,
use DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift information about the
stack and its resources.

When detecting drift on a stack, AWS CloudFormation does not detect
drift on any nested stacks belonging to that stack. Perform
\code{DetectStackDrift} directly on the nested stack itself.
