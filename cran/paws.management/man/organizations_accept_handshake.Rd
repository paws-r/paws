\description{
Sends a response to the originator of a handshake agreeing to the action
proposed by the handshake request.
}
\details{
This operation can be called only by the following principals when they
also have the relevant IAM permissions:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Invitation to join} or \strong{Approve all features request}
handshakes: only a principal from the member account.

The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the
\code{organizations:AcceptHandshake} permission. If you enabled all
features in the organization, the user must also have the
\code{iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole} permission so that AWS Organizations
can create the required service-linked role named
\code{AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations}. For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integration_services.html#orgs_integration_service-linked-roles}{AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide}.
\item \strong{Enable all features final confirmation} handshake: only a
principal from the master account.

For more information about invitations, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html}{Inviting an AWS Account to Join Your Organization}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.} For more information about
requests to enable all features in the organization, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html}{Enabling All Features in Your Organization}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide.}

After you accept a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of
relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it\'s deleted.
