\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] The name of the scheduled query. The name must be unique within your
account and region. Valid characters are alphanumeric characters,
hyphens, underscores, and periods. Length must be between 1 and 255
characters.}

\item{description}{An optional description for the scheduled query to help identify its

\item{queryLanguage}{[required] The query language to use for the scheduled query. Valid values are
\code{LogsQL}, \code{PPL}, and \code{SQL}.}

\item{queryString}{[required] The query string to execute. This is the same query syntax used in
CloudWatch Logs Insights. Maximum length is 10,000 characters.}

\item{logGroupIdentifiers}{An array of log group names or ARNs to query. You can specify between 1
and 50 log groups. Log groups can be identified by name or full ARN.}

\item{scheduleExpression}{[required] A cron expression that defines when the scheduled query runs. The
expression uses standard cron syntax and supports minute-level
precision. Maximum length is 256 characters.}

\item{timezone}{The timezone for evaluating the schedule expression. This determines
when the scheduled query executes relative to the specified timezone.}

\item{startTimeOffset}{The time offset in seconds that defines the lookback period for the
query. This determines how far back in time the query searches from the
execution time.}

\item{destinationConfiguration}{Configuration for where to deliver query results. Currently supports
Amazon S3 destinations for storing query output.}

\item{scheduleStartTime}{The start time for the scheduled query in Unix epoch format. The query
will not execute before this time.}

\item{scheduleEndTime}{The end time for the scheduled query in Unix epoch format. The query
will stop executing after this time.}

\item{executionRoleArn}{[required] The ARN of the IAM role that grants permissions to execute the query and
deliver results to the specified destination. The role must have
permissions to read from the specified log groups and write to the
destination.}

\item{state}{The initial state of the scheduled query. Valid values are \code{ENABLED} and
\code{DISABLED}. Default is \code{ENABLED}.}

\item{tags}{Key-value pairs to associate with the scheduled query for resource
management and cost allocation.}

Creates a scheduled query that runs CloudWatch Logs Insights queries at regular intervals. Scheduled queries enable proactive monitoring by automatically executing queries to detect patterns and anomalies in your log data. Query results can be delivered to Amazon S3 for analysis or further processing.
