\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains
the configuration information for the managed node.

You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you
created, or a document that is shared with you from another account.

For Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that are shared with you
from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete
SSM document ARN, in the following format:

\code{arn:partition:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name }

For example:

\code{arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document}

For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you
created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For
example, \code{AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline} or \code{My-Document}.}

\item{DocumentVersion}{The document version you want to associate with the target(s). Can be a
specific version or the default version.

State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new
version of a document if that document is shared from another account.
State Manager always runs the \code{default} version of a document if shared
from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that
a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a
new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the
document version to \code{default}.}

\item{InstanceId}{The managed node ID.

\code{InstanceId} has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for an
association, use the \code{Targets} parameter. Requests that include the
parameter \code{InstanceID} with Systems Manager documents (SSM documents)
that use schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In addition, if you use
the parameter \code{InstanceId}, you can't use the parameters
\code{AssociationName}, \code{DocumentVersion}, \code{MaxErrors}, \code{MaxConcurrency},
\code{OutputLocation}, or \code{ScheduleExpression}. To use these parameters, you
must use the \code{Targets} parameter.}

\item{Parameters}{The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document.}

\item{Targets}{The targets for the association. You can target managed nodes by using
tags, Amazon Web Services resource groups, all managed nodes in an
Amazon Web Services account, or individual managed node IDs. You can
target all managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account by specifying
the \code{InstanceIds} key with a value of \code{*}. For more information about
choosing targets for an association, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-state-manager-targets-and-rate-controls.html}{Using targets and rate controls with State Manager associations}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide}.}

\item{ScheduleExpression}{A cron expression when the association will be applied to the target(s).}

\item{OutputLocation}{An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where you want to
store the output details of the request.}

\item{AssociationName}{Specify a descriptive name for the association.}

\item{AutomationTargetParameterName}{Choose the parameter that will define how your automation will branch
out. This target is required for associations that use an Automation
runbook and target resources by using rate controls. Automation is a
capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.}

\item{MaxErrors}{The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending
requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify
either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of
the target set, for example 10\%. If you specify 3, for example, the
system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you
specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error
is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set
\code{MaxError} to 10\%, then the system stops sending the request when the
sixth error is received.

Executions that are already running an association when \code{MaxErrors} is
reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail
as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors
failed executions, set \code{MaxConcurrency} to 1 so that executions proceed
one at a time.}

\item{MaxConcurrency}{The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same
time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the
target set, for example 10\%. The default value is 100\%, which means all
targets run the association at the same time.

If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while
Systems Manager is running \code{MaxConcurrency} associations, the
association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the
new managed node will process its association within the limit specified
for \code{MaxConcurrency}.}

\item{ComplianceSeverity}{The severity level to assign to the association.}

\item{SyncCompliance}{The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify \code{AUTO}
or \code{MANUAL}. In \code{AUTO} mode, the system uses the status of the
association execution to determine the compliance status. If the
association execution runs successfully, then the association is
\code{COMPLIANT}. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the
association is \code{NON-COMPLIANT}.

In \code{MANUAL} mode, you must specify the \code{AssociationId} as a parameter
for the \code{\link[=ssm_put_compliance_items]{put_compliance_items}} API
operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager.
It is managed by your direct call to the
\code{\link[=ssm_put_compliance_items]{put_compliance_items}} API operation.

By default, all associations use \code{AUTO} mode.}

\item{ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval}{By default, when you create a new association, the system runs it
immediately after it is created and then according to the schedule you
specified. Specify this option if you don't want an association to run
immediately after you create it. This parameter isn't supported for rate
expressions.}

\item{CalendarNames}{The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar type
documents you want to gate your associations under. The associations
only run when that change calendar is open. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar.html}{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calendar}.}

\item{TargetLocations}{A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon
Web Services accounts where you want to run the association. Use this
action to create an association in multiple Regions and multiple
accounts.}

\item{ScheduleOffset}{Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association.
For example, if you specified a cron schedule of
\verb{cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *)}, you could specify an offset of 3 to run the
association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more
information about cron schedules for associations, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/reference-cron-and-rate-expressions.html}{Reference: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide}.

To use offsets, you must specify the \code{ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval}
parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association
immediately after you create it.}

\item{TargetMaps}{A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.}

\description{
A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain on your managed nodes. For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and running on your managed nodes, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when new managed nodes are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service.
