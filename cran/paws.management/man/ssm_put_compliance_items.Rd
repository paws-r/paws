\title{Registers a compliance type and other compliance details on a designated
resource}
\usage{
ssm_put_compliance_items(
  ResourceId,
  ResourceType,
  ComplianceType,
  ExecutionSummary,
  Items,
  ItemContentHash = NULL,
  UploadType = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ResourceId}{[required] Specify an ID for this resource. For a managed node, this is the node
ID.}

\item{ResourceType}{[required] Specify the type of resource. \code{ManagedInstance} is currently the only
supported resource type.}

\item{ComplianceType}{[required] Specify the compliance type. For example, specify Association (for a
State Manager association), Patch, or Custom:\code{string}.}

\item{ExecutionSummary}{[required] A summary of the call execution that includes an execution ID, the type
of execution (for example, \code{Command}), and the date/time of the
execution using a datetime object that is saved in the following format:
yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'.}

\item{Items}{[required] Information about the compliance as defined by the resource type. For
example, for a patch compliance type, \code{Items} includes information about
the PatchSeverity, Classification, and so on.}

\item{ItemContentHash}{MD5 or SHA-256 content hash. The content hash is used to determine if
existing information should be overwritten or ignored. If the content
hashes match, the request to put compliance information is ignored.}

\item{UploadType}{The mode for uploading compliance items. You can specify \code{COMPLETE} or
\code{PARTIAL}. In \code{COMPLETE} mode, the system overwrites all existing
compliance information for the resource. You must provide a full list of
compliance items each time you send the request.

In \code{PARTIAL} mode, the system overwrites compliance information for a
specific association. The association must be configured with
\code{SyncCompliance} set to \code{MANUAL}. By default, all requests use
\code{COMPLETE} mode.

This attribute is only valid for association compliance.}
}
\description{
Registers a compliance type and other compliance details on a designated resource. This operation lets you register custom compliance details with a resource. This call overwrites existing compliance information on the resource, so you must provide a full list of compliance items each time that you send the request.
