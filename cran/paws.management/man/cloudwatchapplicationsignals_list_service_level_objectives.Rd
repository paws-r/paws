\arguments{
\item{KeyAttributes}{You can use this optional field to specify which services you want to
retrieve SLO information for.

This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.
\itemize{
\item \code{Type} designates the type of object this is.
\item \code{ResourceType} specifies the type of the resource. This field is
used only when the value of the \code{Type} field is \code{Resource} or
\code{AWS::Resource}.
\item \code{Name} specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the
value of the \code{Type} field is \code{Service}, \code{RemoteService}, or
\code{AWS::Service}.
\item \code{Identifier} identifies the resource objects of this resource. This
is used only if the value of the \code{Type} field is \code{Resource} or
\code{AWS::Resource}.
\item \code{Environment} specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
what it belongs to.
}}

\item{OperationName}{The name of the operation that this SLO is associated with.}

\item{DependencyConfig}{Identifies the dependency using the \code{DependencyKeyAttributes} and
\code{DependencyOperationName}.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return in one operation. If you omit
this parameter, the default of 50 is used.}

\item{NextToken}{Include this value, if it was returned by the previous operation, to get
the next set of service level objectives.}

\item{MetricSourceTypes}{Use this optional field to only include SLOs with the specified metric
source types in the output. Supported types are:
\itemize{
\item Service operation
\item Service dependency
\item CloudWatch metric
}}

\item{IncludeLinkedAccounts}{If you are using this operation in a monitoring account, specify \code{true}
to include SLO from source accounts in the returned data.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ </p> <p>When you are monitoring an account, you can use Amazon Web Services account ID in <code>KeyAttribute</code> filter for service source account and <code>SloOwnerawsaccountID</code> for SLO source account with <code>IncludeLinkedAccounts</code> to filter the returned data to only a single source account. </p>
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}}

\item{SloOwnerAwsAccountId}{SLO's Amazon Web Services account ID.}
