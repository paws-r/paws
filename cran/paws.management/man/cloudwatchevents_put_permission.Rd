\title{Running PutPermission permits the specified AWS account or AWS
organization to put events to the specified \emph{event bus}}
\usage{
cloudwatchevents_put_permission(EventBusName, Action, Principal,
  StatementId, Condition)
}
\arguments{
\item{EventBusName}{The event bus associated with the rule. If you omit this, the default
event bus is used.}

\item{Action}{[required] The action that you\'re enabling the other account to perform.
Currently, this must be \code{events:PutEvents}.}

\item{Principal}{[required] The 12-digit AWS account ID that you are permitting to put events to
your default event bus. Specify \"*\" to permit any account to put
events to your default event bus.

If you specify \"*\" without specifying \code{Condition}, avoid creating
rules that might match undesirable events. To create more secure rules,
make sure that the event pattern for each rule contains an \code{account}
field with a specific account ID to receive events from. Rules with an
account field don\'t match any events sent from other accounts.}

\item{StatementId}{[required] An identifier string for the external account that you\'re granting
permissions to. If you later want to revoke the permission for this
external account, specify this \code{StatementId} when you run
RemovePermission.}

\item{Condition}{This parameter enables you to limit the permission to accounts that
fulfill a certain condition, such as being a member of a certain AWS
organization. For more information about AWS Organizations, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html}{What Is AWS Organizations?}
in the \emph{AWS Organizations User Guide}.

If you specify \code{Condition} with an AWS organization ID and specify
\"*\" as the value for \code{Principal}, you grant permission to all the
accounts in the named organization.

The \code{Condition} is a JSON string that must contain \code{Type}, \code{Key}, and
\code{Value} fields.}
}
\description{
Running \code{PutPermission} permits the specified AWS account or AWS
organization to put events to the specified \emph{event bus}. Rules in your
account are triggered by these events arriving to an event bus in your
account.
}
\details{
For another account to send events to your account, that external
account must have a rule with your account\'s event bus as a target.

To enable multiple AWS accounts to put events to an event bus, run
\code{PutPermission} once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts
are members of the same AWS organization, you can run \code{PutPermission}
once specifying \code{Principal} as \"*\" and specifying the AWS
organization ID in \code{Condition}, to grant permissions to all accounts in
that organization.

If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that
organization must specify a \code{RoleArn} with proper permissions when they
use \code{PutTarget} to add your account\'s event bus as a target. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html}{Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts}
in the \emph{Amazon EventBridge User Guide}.

The permission policy on an event bus can\'t exceed 10 KB in size.
