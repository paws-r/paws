\description{
Deletes the specified organization config rule and all of its evaluation
results from all member accounts in that organization.

Only a master account and a delegated administrator account can delete
an organization config rule. When calling this API with a delegated
administrator, you must ensure AWS Organizations
\code{ListDelegatedAdministrator} permissions are added.

AWS Config sets the state of a rule to DELETE_IN_PROGRESS until the
deletion is complete. You cannot update a rule while it is in this
state.
