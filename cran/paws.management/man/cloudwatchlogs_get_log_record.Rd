\usage{
cloudwatchlogs_get_log_record(logRecordPointer)
}
\arguments{
\item{logRecordPointer}{[required] The pointer corresponding to the log event record you want to retrieve.
You get this from the response of a \code{GetQueryResults} operation. In that
response, the value of the \verb{@ptr} field for a log event is the value to
use as \code{logRecordPointer} to retrieve that complete log event record.}
}
\description{
Retrieves all the fields and values of a single log event. All fields
are retrieved, even if the original query that produced the
\code{logRecordPointer} retrieved only a subset of fields. Fields are
returned as field name/field value pairs.
}
\details{
Additionally, the entire unparsed log event is returned within
\verb{@message}.
