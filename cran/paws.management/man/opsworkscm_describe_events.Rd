\title{Describes events for a specified server}
\usage{
opsworkscm_describe_events(ServerName, NextToken, MaxResults)
}
\arguments{
\item{ServerName}{[required] The name of the server for which you want to view events.}

\item{NextToken}{NextToken is a string that is returned in some command responses. It
indicates that not all entries have been returned, and that you must run
at least one more request to get remaining items. To get remaining
results, call \code{DescribeEvents} again, and assign the token from the
previous results as the value of the \code{nextToken} parameter. If there are
no more results, the response object\'s \code{nextToken} parameter value is
\code{null}. Setting a \code{nextToken} value that was not returned in your
previous results causes an \code{InvalidNextTokenException} to occur.}

\item{MaxResults}{To receive a paginated response, use this parameter to specify the
maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the
number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes
a \code{NextToken} value that you can assign to the \code{NextToken} request
parameter to get the next set of results.}
}
\description{

}
\details{
This operation is synchronous.

A \code{ResourceNotFoundException} is thrown when the server does not exist.
A \code{ValidationException} is raised when parameters of the request are not
valid.
