time period}
\usage{
pi_get_resource_metrics(
  ServiceType,
  Identifier,
  MetricQueries,
  StartTime,
  EndTime,
  PeriodInSeconds = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ServiceType}{[required] The Amazon Web Services service for which Performance Insights returns
metrics. Valid values are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{RDS}
\item \code{DOCDB}
}}

\item{Identifier}{[required] An immutable identifier for a data source that is unique for an Amazon
Web Services Region. Performance Insights gathers metrics from this data
source. In the console, the identifier is shown as \emph{ResourceID}. When
you call \code{DescribeDBInstances}, the identifier is returned as
\code{DbiResourceId}.

To use a DB instance as a data source, specify its \code{DbiResourceId}
value. For example, specify \code{db-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU1VW2X}.}

\item{MetricQueries}{[required] An array of one or more queries to perform. Each query must specify a
Performance Insights metric, and can optionally specify aggregation and
filtering criteria.}

\item{StartTime}{[required] The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time series
query range. You can't specify a \code{StartTime} that is earlier than 7 days
ago. By default, Performance Insights has 7 days of retention, but you
can extend this range up to 2 years. The value specified is \emph{inclusive}.
Thus, the command returns data points equal to or greater than
\code{StartTime}.

The value for \code{StartTime} must be earlier than the value for \code{EndTime}.}

\item{EndTime}{[required] The date and time specifying the end of the requested time series query
range. The value specified is \emph{exclusive}. Thus, the command returns
data points less than (but not equal to) \code{EndTime}.

The value for \code{EndTime} must be later than the value for \code{StartTime}.}

\item{PeriodInSeconds}{The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned from
Performance Insights. A period can be as short as one second, or as long
as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{1} (one second)
\item \code{60} (one minute)
\item \code{300} (five minutes)
\item \code{3600} (one hour)
\item \code{86400} (twenty-four hours)
}

If you don't specify \code{PeriodInSeconds}, then Performance Insights will
choose a value for you, with a goal of returning roughly 100-200 data
points in the response.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of items to return in the response. If more items
exist than the specified \code{MaxRecords} value, a pagination token is
included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.}

\item{NextToken}{An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the
token, up to the value specified by \code{MaxRecords}.}
}
\description{
Retrieve Performance Insights metrics for a set of data sources over a time period. You can provide specific dimension groups and dimensions, and provide aggregation and filtering criteria for each group.
