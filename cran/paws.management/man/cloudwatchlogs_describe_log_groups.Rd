\usage{
cloudwatchlogs_describe_log_groups(
  accountIdentifiers = NULL,
  logGroupNamePrefix = NULL,
  logGroupNamePattern = NULL,
  nextToken = NULL,
  limit = NULL,
  includeLinkedAccounts = NULL,
  logGroupClass = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{accountIdentifiers}{When \code{includeLinkedAccounts} is set to \code{True}, use this parameter to
specify the list of accounts to search. You can specify as many as 20
account IDs in the array.}

\item{logGroupNamePrefix}{The prefix to match.

\code{logGroupNamePrefix} and \code{logGroupNamePattern} are mutually exclusive.
Only one of these parameters can be passed.}

\item{logGroupNamePattern}{If you specify a string for this parameter, the operation returns only
log groups that have names that match the string based on a
case-sensitive substring search. For example, if you specify \code{Foo}, log
groups named \code{FooBar}, \code{aws/Foo}, and \code{GroupFoo} would match, but \code{foo},
\code{F/o/o} and \code{Froo} would not match.

If you specify \code{logGroupNamePattern} in your request, then only \code{arn},
\code{creationTime}, and \code{logGroupName} are included in the response.

\code{logGroupNamePattern} and \code{logGroupNamePrefix} are mutually exclusive.
Only one of these parameters can be passed.}

\item{nextToken}{The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token
from a previous call.)}

\item{limit}{The maximum number of items returned. If you don't specify a value, the
default is up to 50 items.}

\item{includeLinkedAccounts}{If you are using a monitoring account, set this to \code{True} to have the
operation return log groups in the accounts listed in
\code{accountIdentifiers}.

If this parameter is set to \code{true} and \code{accountIdentifiers} contains a
null value, the operation returns all log groups in the monitoring
account and all log groups in all source accounts that are linked to the
monitoring account.}

\item{logGroupClass}{Specifies the log group class for this log group. There are three
classes:
\itemize{
\item The \code{Standard} log class supports all CloudWatch Logs features.
\item The \verb{Infrequent Access} log class supports a subset of CloudWatch
Logs features and incurs lower costs.
\item Use the \code{Delivery} log class only for delivering Lambda logs to
store in Amazon S3 or Amazon Data Firehose. Log events in log groups
in the Delivery class are kept in CloudWatch Logs for only one day.
This log class doesn't offer rich CloudWatch Logs capabilities such
as CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.
}

For details about the features supported by each class, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch_Logs_Log_Classes.html}{Log classes}}
}

Lists the specified log groups. You can list all your log groups or filter the results by prefix. The results are ASCII-sorted by log group name.
