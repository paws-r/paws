\title{Stops a specified instance}
\usage{
opsworks_stop_instance(InstanceId, Force)
}
\arguments{
\item{InstanceId}{[required] The instance ID.}

\item{Force}{Specifies whether to force an instance to stop. If the instance\'s root
device type is \code{ebs}, or EBS-backed, adding the \code{Force} parameter to the
\code{StopInstances} API call disassociates the AWS OpsWorks Stacks instance
from EC2, and forces deletion of \emph{only} the OpsWorks Stacks instance.
You must also delete the formerly-associated instance in EC2 after
troubleshooting and replacing the AWS OpsWorks Stacks instance with a
new one.}
}
\description{
Stops a specified instance. When you stop a standard instance, the data
disappears and must be reinstalled when you restart the instance. You
can stop an Amazon EBS-backed instance without losing data. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinginstances-starting.html}{Starting, Stopping, and Rebooting Instances}.
}
\details{
\strong{Required Permissions}: To use this action, an IAM user must have a
Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached policy that
explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/opsworks-security-users.html}{Managing User Permissions}.
