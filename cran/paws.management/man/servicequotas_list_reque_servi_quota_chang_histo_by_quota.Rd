\usage{
servicequotas_list_requested_service_quota_change_history_by_quota(
  ServiceCode,
  QuotaCode,
  Status = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  QuotaRequestedAtLevel = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ServiceCode}{[required] Specifies the service identifier. To find the service code value for an
Amazon Web Services service, use the
\code{\link[=servicequotas_list_services]{list_services}} operation.}

\item{QuotaCode}{[required] Specifies the quota identifier. To find the quota code for a specific
quota, use the
\code{\link[=servicequotas_list_service_quotas]{list_service_quotas}} operation,
and look for the \code{QuotaCode} response in the output for the quota you
want.}

\item{Status}{Specifies that you want to filter the results to only the requests with
the matching status.}

\item{NextToken}{Specifies a value for receiving additional results after you receive a
\code{NextToken} response in a previous request. A \code{NextToken} response
indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value
of the previous call's \code{NextToken} response to indicate where the output
should continue from.}

\item{MaxResults}{Specifies the maximum number of results that you want included on each
page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults
to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist
beyond those included in the current response, the \code{NextToken} response
element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as
the \code{NextToken} request parameter in the next call to the operation to
get the next part of the results.

An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when
there are more results available. You should check \code{NextToken} after
every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.}

\item{QuotaRequestedAtLevel}{Filters the response to return quota requests for the \code{ACCOUNT},
\code{RESOURCE}, or \code{ALL} levels. \code{ACCOUNT} is the default.}
}
