#' Creates a new case in the AWS Support Center
#'
#' Creates a new case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is modeled
#' on the behavior of the AWS Support Center [Create
#' Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page.
#' Its parameters require you to specify the following information:
#' 
#' -   **issueType.** The type of issue for the case. You can specify
#'     either \"customer-service\" or \"technical.\" If you do not indicate
#'     a value, the default is \"technical.\"
#' 
#' -   **serviceCode.** The code for an AWS service. You obtain the
#'     `serviceCode` by calling DescribeServices.
#' 
#' -   **categoryCode.** The category for the service defined for the
#'     `serviceCode` value. You also obtain the category code for a service
#'     by calling DescribeServices. Each AWS service defines its own set of
#'     category codes.
#' 
#' -   **severityCode.** A value that indicates the urgency of the case,
#'     which in turn determines the response time according to your service
#'     level agreement with AWS Support. You obtain the SeverityCode by
#'     calling DescribeSeverityLevels.
#' 
#' -   **subject.** The **Subject** field on the AWS Support Center [Create
#'     Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create)
#'     page.
#' 
#' -   **communicationBody.** The **Description** field on the AWS Support
#'     Center [Create
#'     Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create)
#'     page.
#' 
#' -   **attachmentSetId.** The ID of a set of attachments that has been
#'     created by using AddAttachmentsToSet.
#' 
#' -   **language.** The human language in which AWS Support handles the
#'     case. English and Japanese are currently supported.
#' 
#' -   **ccEmailAddresses.** The AWS Support Center **CC** field on the
#'     [Create
#'     Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create)
#'     page. You can list email addresses to be copied on any

#'     already identified by passing the AWS Credentials in the HTTP POST
#'     method or in a method or function call from one of the programming
#'     languages supported by an [AWS SDK](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
#' 
#' To add additional communication or attachments to an existing case, use
#' AddCommunicationToCase.

#' numbers are used by the DescribeCases operation to retrieve existing AWS
