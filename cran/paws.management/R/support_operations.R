#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/support_create_case/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/support_create_case/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param subject &#91;required&#93; The title of the support case. The title appears in the **Subject**
#' field on the Amazon Web Services Support Center Create Case page.
#' @param serviceCode The code for the Amazon Web Services service. You can use the
#' [`describe_services`][support_describe_services] operation to get the
#' possible `serviceCode` values.
#' @param severityCode A value that indicates the urgency of the case. This value determines

#' @param communicationBody &#91;required&#93; The communication body text that describes the issue. This text appears
#' in the **Description** field on the Amazon Web Services Support Center
#' Create Case page.
