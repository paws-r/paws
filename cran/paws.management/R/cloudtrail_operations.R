#' @description
#' Adds one or more tags to a trail, event data store, or channel, up to a limit of 50. Overwrites an existing tag's value when a new value is specified for an existing tag key. Tag key names must be unique; you cannot have two keys with the same name but different values. If you specify a key without a value, the tag will be created with the specified key and a value of null. You can tag a trail or event data store that applies to all Amazon Web Services Regions only from the Region in which the trail or event data store was created (also known as its home Region).

#' Creates a new event data store
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a new event data store.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudtrail_create_event_data_store/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudtrail_create_event_data_store/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; The name of the event data store.
#' @param AdvancedEventSelectors The advanced event selectors to use to select the events for the data
#' store. You can configure up to five advanced event selectors for each
#' event data store.
#' 
#' For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to log
#' CloudTrail events, see [Log events by using advanced event
#' selectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#creating-data-event-selectors-advanced)
#' in the CloudTrail User Guide.
#' 
#' For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to
#' include Config configuration items in your event data store, see [Create
#' an event data store for Config configuration
#' items](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/lake-eds-cli.html#lake-cli-create-eds-config)
#' in the CloudTrail User Guide.
#' 
#' For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to
#' include events outside of Amazon Web Services events in your event data
#' store, see [Create an integration to log events from outside Amazon Web
#' Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/lake-integrations-cli.html#lake-cli-create-integration)
#' in the CloudTrail User Guide.
#' @param MultiRegionEnabled Specifies whether the event data store includes events from all Regions,
#' or only from the Region in which the event data store is created.
#' @param OrganizationEnabled Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for an
#' organization in Organizations.
#' @param RetentionPeriod The retention period of the event data store, in days. If `BillingMode`
#' is set to `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period
#' of up to 3653 days, the equivalent of 10 years. If `BillingMode` is set
#' to `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period of up to
#' 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.
#' 
#' CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the
#' `eventTime` of the event is within the specified retention period. For
#' example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will
#' remove events when the `eventTime` is older than 90 days.
#' 
#' If you plan to copy trail events to this event data store, we recommend
#' that you consider both the age of the events that you want to copy as
#' well as how long you want to keep the copied events in your event data
#' store. For example, if you copy trail events that are 5 years old and
#' specify a retention period of 7 years, the event data store will retain
#' those events for two years.
#' @param TerminationProtectionEnabled Specifies whether termination protection is enabled for the event data
#' store. If termination protection is enabled, you cannot delete the event
#' data store until termination protection is disabled.
#' @param TagsList 
#' @param KmsKeyId Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by
#' CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by `alias/`, a fully
#' specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally
#' unique identifier.
#' 
#' Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on
#' the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data
#' store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store
#' that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store
#' with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you
#' disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store,
#' delete or back up your event data store.
#' 
#' CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
#' about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region
#' keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html)
#' in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Examples:
#' 
#' - `alias/MyAliasName`
#' 
#' - `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName`
#' 
#' - `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
#' 
#' - `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
#' @param StartIngestion Specifies whether the event data store should start ingesting live
#' events. The default is true.
#' @param BillingMode The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost for
#' ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for the
#' event data store.
#' 
#' The following are the possible values:
#' 
#' - `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is generally
#'   recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653 days
#'   (about 10 years). The default retention period for this billing mode
#'   is 366 days.
#' 
#' - `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is recommended if you
#'   expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a
#'   retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years). The default
#'   retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.
#' 
#' The default value is `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`.

#' Creates a trail that specifies the settings for delivery of log data to an Amazon S3 bucket.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudtrail_create_trail/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudtrail_create_trail/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; Specifies the name of the trail. The name must meet the following
#' requirements:
#' 
#' - Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
#'   underscores (_), or dashes (-)
#' 
#' - Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number
#' 
#' - Be between 3 and 128 characters
#' 
#' - Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like
#'   `my-_namespace` and `my--namespace` are not valid.
#' 
#' - Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)
#' @param S3BucketName &#91;required&#93; Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing log
#' files. For information about bucket naming rules, see [Bucket naming
#' rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html)
#' in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*.
#' @param S3KeyPrefix Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the
#' bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information,
#' see [Finding Your CloudTrail Log
#' Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/get-and-view-cloudtrail-log-files.html#cloudtrail-find-log-files).
#' The maximum length is 200 characters.
#' @param SnsTopicName Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of
#' log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
#' @param IncludeGlobalServiceEvents Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services
#' such as IAM to the log files.
#' @param IsMultiRegionTrail Specifies whether the trail is created in the current Region or in all
#' Regions. The default is false, which creates a trail only in the Region
#' where you are signed in. As a best practice, consider creating trails
#' that log events in all Regions.
#' @param EnableLogFileValidation Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled. The default
#' is false.
#' 
#' When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest
#' files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not create digest files
#' for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file
#' integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file
#' integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January
#' 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be
#' created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on
#' January 10. The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or
#' delete a trail.
#' @param CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique
#' identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will
#' be delivered. You must use a log group that exists in your account.
#' 
#' Not required unless you specify `CloudWatchLogsRoleArn`.
#' @param CloudWatchLogsRoleArn Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write
#' to a user's log group. You must use a role that exists in your account.
#' @param KmsKeyId Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by
#' CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by `alias/`, a fully
#' specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally
#' unique identifier.
#' 
#' CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information

#' 
#' - `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
#' @param IsOrganizationTrail Specifies whether the trail is created for all accounts in an
#' organization in Organizations, or only for the current Amazon Web
#' Services account. The default is false, and cannot be true unless the

#' Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail
#'
#' @description
#' Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail. Use event selectors or advanced event selectors to specify management and data event settings for your trail. If you want your trail to log Insights events, be sure the event selector enables logging of the Insights event types you want configured for your trail. For more information about logging Insights events, see [Logging Insights events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the *CloudTrail User Guide*. By default, trails created without specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudtrail_put_event_selectors/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudtrail_put_event_selectors/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param TrailName &#91;required&#93; Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail
#' name, the string must meet the following requirements:
#' 
#' - Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),

#' 
#' - Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)
#' 
#' If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.
#' 
#' `arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail`
#' @param EventSelectors Specifies the settings for your event selectors. You can configure up to

#' Starts an import of logged trail events from a source S3 bucket to a

#'
#' @description
#' Starts an import of logged trail events from a source S3 bucket to a destination event data store. By default, CloudTrail only imports events contained in the S3 bucket's `CloudTrail` prefix and the prefixes inside the `CloudTrail` prefix, and does not check prefixes for other Amazon Web Services services.

#' Updates an event data store
#'
#' @description
#' Updates an event data store. The required `EventDataStore` value is an ARN or the ID portion of the ARN. Other parameters are optional, but at least one optional parameter must be specified, or CloudTrail throws an error. `RetentionPeriod` is in days, and valid values are integers between 7 and 3653 if the `BillingMode` is set to `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`, or between 7 and 2557 if `BillingMode` is set to `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`. By default, `TerminationProtection` is enabled.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudtrail_update_event_data_store/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudtrail_update_event_data_store/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param EventDataStore &#91;required&#93; The ARN (or the ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data store that you
#' want to update.
#' @param Name The event data store name.
#' @param AdvancedEventSelectors The advanced event selectors used to select events for the event data
#' store. You can configure up to five advanced event selectors for each
#' event data store.
#' @param MultiRegionEnabled Specifies whether an event data store collects events from all Regions,
#' or only from the Region in which it was created.
#' @param OrganizationEnabled Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for an
#' organization in Organizations.
#' 
#' Only the management account for the organization can convert an
#' organization event data store to a non-organization event data store, or
#' convert a non-organization event data store to an organization event
#' data store.
#' @param RetentionPeriod The retention period of the event data store, in days. If `BillingMode`
#' is set to `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period
#' of up to 3653 days, the equivalent of 10 years. If `BillingMode` is set
#' to `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`, you can set a retention period of up to
#' 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.
#' 
#' CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the
#' `eventTime` of the event is within the specified retention period. For
#' example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will
#' remove events when the `eventTime` is older than 90 days.
#' 
#' If you decrease the retention period of an event data store, CloudTrail
#' will remove any events with an `eventTime` older than the new retention
#' period. For example, if the previous retention period was 365 days and
#' you decrease it to 100 days, CloudTrail will remove events with an
#' `eventTime` older than 100 days.
#' @param TerminationProtectionEnabled Indicates that termination protection is enabled and the event data
#' store cannot be automatically deleted.
#' @param KmsKeyId Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by
#' CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by `alias/`, a fully
#' specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally
#' unique identifier.
#' 
#' Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on
#' the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data
#' store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store
#' that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store
#' with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you
#' disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store,
#' delete or back up your event data store.
#' 
#' CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
#' about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region
#' keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html)
#' in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Examples:
#' 
#' - `alias/MyAliasName`
#' 
#' - `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName`
#' 
#' - `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
#' 
#' - `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
#' @param BillingMode You can't change the billing mode from `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` to
#' `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`. If `BillingMode` is set to
#' `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` and you want to use
#' `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING` instead, you'll need to stop ingestion on the
#' event data store and create a new event data store that uses
#' `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`.
#' 
#' The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost for
#' ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for the
#' event data store.
#' 
#' The following are the possible values:
#' 
#' - `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is generally
#'   recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653 days
#'   (about 10 years). The default retention period for this billing mode
#'   is 366 days.
#' 
#' - `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is recommended if you
#'   expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a
#'   retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years). The default
#'   retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.

#' the string must meet the following requirements:
#' 
#' - Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
#'   underscores (_), or dashes (-)
#' 
#' - Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

#' 
#' - Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)
#' 
#' If `Name` is a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.
#' 
#' `arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail`
#' @param S3BucketName Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing log
#' files. See [Amazon S3 Bucket naming
#' rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).
#' @param S3KeyPrefix Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the
#' bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information,
#' see [Finding Your CloudTrail Log
#' Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/get-and-view-cloudtrail-log-files.html#cloudtrail-find-log-files).
#' The maximum length is 200 characters.
#' @param SnsTopicName Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of
#' log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
#' @param IncludeGlobalServiceEvents Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services
#' such as IAM to the log files.
#' @param IsMultiRegionTrail Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current Region or to all
#' Regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only in the current
#' Region and this value is set to true, shadow trails (replications of the
#' trail) will be created in the other Regions. If the trail exists in all
#' Regions and this value is set to false, the trail will remain in the
#' Region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other Regions will
#' be deleted. As a best practice, consider using trails that log events in
#' all Regions.
#' @param EnableLogFileValidation Specifies whether log file validation is enabled. The default is false.
#' 
#' When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest
#' files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not create digest files
#' for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file
#' integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file
#' integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January
#' 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be
#' created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on
#' January 10. The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or
#' delete a trail.
#' @param CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique
#' identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs are
#' delivered. You must use a log group that exists in your account.
#' 
#' Not required unless you specify `CloudWatchLogsRoleArn`.
#' @param CloudWatchLogsRoleArn Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write
#' to a user's log group. You must use a role that exists in your account.
#' @param KmsKeyId Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by
#' CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a fully
#' specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally
#' unique identifier.
#' 
#' CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
#' about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region
#' keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html)
#' in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Examples:
#' 
#' - alias/MyAliasName
#' 
#' - arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
#' 
#' - arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
#' 
#' - 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
#' @param IsOrganizationTrail Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an
#' organization in Organizations, or only for the current Amazon Web
#' Services account. The default is false, and cannot be true unless the
#' call is made on behalf of an Amazon Web Services account that is the
#' management account for an organization in Organizations. If the trail is
#' not an organization trail and this is set to `true`, the trail will be
#' created in all Amazon Web Services accounts that belong to the
#' organization. If the trail is an organization trail and this is set to
#' `false`, the trail will remain in the current Amazon Web Services
#' account but be deleted from all member accounts in the organization.
#' 
#' Only the management account for the organization can convert an
#' organization trail to a non-organization trail, or convert a
#' non-organization trail to an organization trail.
