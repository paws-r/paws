#' -   `PValue` specifies to use p-values for the results. A p-value is
#'     used in hypothesis testing to measure how often you are willing to
#'     make a mistake in rejecting the null hypothesis. A general practice
#'     is to reject the null hypothesis and declare that the results are
#'     statistically significant when the p-value is less than 0.05.
#' 
#' -   `ConfidenceInterval` specifies a confidence interval for the
#'     results. The confidence interval represents the range of values for
#'     the chosen metric that is likely to contain the true difference
#'     between the `baseStat` of a variation and the baseline. Evidently
#'     returns the 95% confidence interval.
#' 
#' -   `TreatmentEffect` is the difference in the statistic specified by
#'     the `baseStat` parameter between each variation and the default
#'     variation.
#' 
#' -   `BaseStat` returns the statistical values collected for the metric
#'     for each variation. The statistic uses the same statistic specified
#'     in the `baseStat` parameter. Therefore, if `baseStat` is `mean`,
#'     this returns the mean of the values collected for each variation.
