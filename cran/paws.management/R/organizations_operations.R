#' Enables all features in an organization

#' Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of organization policies that can restrict the services and actions that can be called in each account. Until you enable all features, you have access only to consolidated billing, and you can't use any of the advanced account administration features that Organizations supports.

#' Sends an invitation to another account to join your organization as a

#'
#' @description
#' Sends an invitation to another account to join your organization as a member account. Organizations sends email on your behalf to the email address that is associated with the other account's owner. The invitation is implemented as a Handshake whose details are in the response.
#'
#' See [https://paws-r.github.io/docs/organizations/invite_account_to_organization.html](https://paws-r.github.io/docs/organizations/invite_account_to_organization.html) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Target &#91;required&#93; The identifier (ID) of the Amazon Web Services account that you want to
#' invite to join your organization. This is a JSON object that contains
#' the following elements:
#' 
#' `{ "Type": "ACCOUNT", "Id": "< account id number >" }`
#' 
#' If you use the CLI, you can submit this as a single string, similar to
#' the following example:
#' 
#' `--target Id=123456789012,Type=ACCOUNT`
#' 
#' If you specify `"Type": "ACCOUNT"`, you must provide the Amazon Web
#' Services account ID number as the `Id`. If you specify
#' `"Type": "EMAIL"`, you must specify the email address that is associated
#' with the account.
#' 
#' `--target Id=diego@@example.com,Type=EMAIL`
#' @param Notes Additional information that you want to include in the generated email
#' to the recipient account owner.
#' @param Tags A list of tags that you want to attach to the account when it becomes a
#' member of the organization. For each tag in the list, you must specify
#' both a tag key and a value. You can set the value to an empty string,
#' but you can't set it to `null`. For more information about tagging, see
#' [Tagging Organizations
#' resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tagging.html)
#' in the Organizations User Guide.
#' 
#' Any tags in the request are checked for compliance with any applicable
#' tag policies when the request is made. The request is rejected if the
#' tags in the request don't match the requirements of the policy at that
#' time. Tag policy compliance is *not* checked again when the invitation
#' is accepted and the tags are actually attached to the account. That
#' means that if the tag policy changes between the invitation and the
#' acceptance, then that tags could potentially be non-compliant.
#' 
#' If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed number of
#' tags for an account, then the entire request fails and invitations are
#' not sent.

#' Lists the handshakes that are associated with the organization that the

#'
#' @description
#' Lists the handshakes that are associated with the organization that the requesting user is part of. The [`list_handshakes_for_organization`][organizations_list_handshakes_for_organization] operation returns a list of handshake structures. Each structure contains details and status about a handshake.
#'
#' See [https://paws-r.github.io/docs/organizations/list_handshakes_for_organization.html](https://paws-r.github.io/docs/organizations/list_handshakes_for_organization.html) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Filter A filter of the handshakes that you want included in the response. The
#' default is all types. Use the `ActionType` element to limit the output
#' to only a specified type, such as `INVITE`, `ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES`, or
#' `APPROVE-ALL-FEATURES`. Alternatively, for the `ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES`
#' handshake that generates a separate child handshake for each member
#' account, you can specify the `ParentHandshakeId` to see only the
#' handshakes that were generated by that parent request.
#' @param NextToken The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a
#' `NextToken` response in a previous request. A `NextToken` response
#' indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value
#' of the previous call's `NextToken` response to indicate where the output
#' should continue from.
#' @param MaxResults The total number of results that you want included on each page of the
#' response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value
#' that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the
#' maximum you specify, the `NextToken` response element is present and has
#' a value (is not null). Include that value as the `NextToken` request
#' parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the
#' results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the
#' maximum even when there are more results available. You should check
#' `NextToken` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the
#' results.
