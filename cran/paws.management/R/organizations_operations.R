#' Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the

#'
#' Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the
#' organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous
#' request that AWS performs in the background. Because `CreateAccount`
#' operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message
#' even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might
#' need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the
#' account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:
#' 
#' -   Use the `OperationId` response element from this operation to
#'     provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.
#' 
#' -   Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the `CreateAccountResult` event.
#'     For information on using AWS CloudTrail with AWS Organizations, see
#'     [Monitoring the Activity in Your
#'     Organization](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html)
#'     in the *AWS Organizations User Guide.*
#' 
#' The user who calls the API to create an account must have the
#' `organizations:CreateAccount` permission. If you enabled all features in
#' the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked
#' role named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`. For more information, see
#' [AWS Organizations and Service-Linked
#' Roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs)
#' in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
#' 
#' AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role
#' (named `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` by default) that grants users in
#' the master account administrator permissions in the new member account.
#' Principals in the master account can assume the role. AWS Organizations
#' clones the company name and address information for the new account from
#' the organization\'s master account.
#' 
#' This operation can be called only from the organization\'s master
#' account.
#' 
#' For more information about creating accounts, see [Creating an AWS

#' 
#' -   When you create an account in an organization, the information
#'     required for the account to operate as a standalone account is *not*
#'     automatically collected. For example, information about the payment
#'     method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is not
#'     collected. If you must remove an account from your organization
#'     later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information.

#' -   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed

#'     then try again. If the error persists, contact [AWS
#'     Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).
#' 
#' -   Using `CreateAccount` to create multiple temporary accounts isn\'t
#'     recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost

#'     information on the requirements and process for closing an account,

#' Removes a member account from its parent organization
#'
#' Removes a member account from its parent organization. This version of
#' the operation is performed by the account that wants to leave. To remove
#' a member account as a user in the master account, use
#' RemoveAccountFromOrganization instead.
#' 
#' This operation can be called only from a member account in the
#' organization.
#' 
#' -   The master account in an organization with all features enabled can
#'     set service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what
#'     administrators of member accounts can do. These restrictions can
#'     include preventing member accounts from successfully calling
#'     `LeaveOrganization`.
#' 
#' -   You can leave an organization as a member account only if the
#'     account is configured with the information required to operate as a
#'     standalone account. When you create an account in an organization
#'     using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI, the information
#'     required of standalone accounts is *not* automatically collected.
#'     For each account that you want to make standalone, you must accept
#'     the end user license agreement (EULA). You must also choose a
#'     support plan, provide and verify the required contact information,
#'     and provide a current payment method. AWS uses the payment method to
#'     charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS activity that occurs
#'     while the account isn\'t attached to an organization. Follow the
#'     steps at [To leave an organization when all required account
#'     information has not yet been
#'     provided](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info)
#'     in the *AWS Organizations User Guide.*
#' 
#' -   You can leave an organization only after you enable IAM user access
#'     to billing in your account. For more information, see [Activating
#'     Access to the Billing and Cost Management
#'     Console](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate)

#' instead.
#' 
#' You can remove an account from your organization only if the account is
#' configured with the information required to operate as a standalone
#' account. When you create an account in an organization using the AWS
#' Organizations console, API, or CLI, the information required of
#' standalone accounts is *not* automatically collected. For an account
#' that you want to make standalone, you must accept the end user license
#' agreement (EULA). You must also choose a support plan, provide and
#' verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment
#' method. AWS uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free
#' tier) AWS activity that occurs while the account isn\'t attached to an
#' organization. To remove an account that doesn\'t yet have this
#' information, you must sign in as the member account. Then follow the
#' steps at [To leave an organization when all required account information
#' has not yet been
#' provided](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info)
