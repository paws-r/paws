#' Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource
#'
#' @description
#' Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. *Tags* are metadata that you can assign to your automations, documents, managed nodes, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed nodes that helps you track each node's owner and stack level. For example:
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_add_tags_to_resource/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_add_tags_to_resource/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param ResourceType &#91;required&#93; Specifies the type of resource you are tagging.
#' 
#' The `ManagedInstance` type for this API operation is for on-premises
#' managed nodes. You must specify the name of the managed node in the
#' following format: `mi-ID_number `. For example, `mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f`.
#' @param ResourceId &#91;required&#93; The resource ID you want to tag.
#' 
#' Use the ID of the resource. Here are some examples:
#' 
#' `MaintenanceWindow`: `mw-012345abcde`
#' 
#' `PatchBaseline`: `pb-012345abcde`
#' 
#' `Automation`: `example-c160-4567-8519-012345abcde`
#' 
#' `OpsMetadata` object: `ResourceID` for tagging is created from the
#' Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the object. Specifically, `ResourceID` is
#' created from the strings that come after the word `opsmetadata` in the
#' ARN. For example, an OpsMetadata object with an ARN of
#' `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:1234567890:opsmetadata/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager`
#' has a `ResourceID` of either `aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager` or
#' `/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager`.
#' 
#' For the `Document` and `Parameter` values, use the name of the resource.
#' If you're tagging a shared document, you must use the full ARN of the
#' document.
#' 
#' `ManagedInstance`: `mi-012345abcde`
#' 
#' The `ManagedInstance` type for this API operation is only for
#' on-premises managed nodes. You must specify the name of the managed node
#' in the following format: `mi-ID_number `. For example,
#' `mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f`.
#' @param Tags &#91;required&#93; One or more tags. The value parameter is required.

#' Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
#'
#' @description
#' Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises servers, edge devices, or virtual machine (VM) with Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager tools. You use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing on-premises machines using Systems Manager, see [Using Amazon Web Services Systems Manager in hybrid and multicloud environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-hybrid-multicloud.html) in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_activation/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_activation/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Description A user-defined description of the resource that you want to register
#' with Systems Manager.
#' 
#' Don't enter personally identifiable information in this field.
#' @param DefaultInstanceName The name of the registered, managed node as it will appear in the Amazon
#' Web Services Systems Manager console or when you use the Amazon Web
#' Services command line tools to list Systems Manager resources.
#' 
#' Don't enter personally identifiable information in this field.
#' @param IamRole &#91;required&#93; The name of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you want
#' to assign to the managed node. This IAM role must provide AssumeRole
#' permissions for the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager service
#' principal `ssm.amazonaws.com`. For more information, see [Create the IAM
#' service role required for Systems Manager in a hybrid and multicloud
#' environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/hybrid-multicloud-service-role.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' 
#' You can't specify an IAM service-linked role for this parameter. You
#' must create a unique role.
#' @param RegistrationLimit Specify the maximum number of managed nodes you want to register. The
#' default value is `1`.
#' @param ExpirationDate The date by which this activation request should expire, in timestamp
#' format, such as "2024-07-07T00:00:00". You can specify a date up to 30
#' days in advance. If you don't provide an expiration date, the activation
#' code expires in 24 hours.
#' @param Tags Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to
#' categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or
#' environment. For example, you might want to tag an activation to
#' identify which servers or virtual machines (VMs) in your on-premises
#' environment you intend to activate. In this case, you could specify the
#' following key-value pairs:
#' 
#' -   `Key=OS,Value=Windows`
#' 
#' -   `Key=Environment,Value=Production`
#' 
#' When you install SSM Agent on your on-premises servers and VMs, you
#' specify an activation ID and code. When you specify the activation ID
#' and code, tags assigned to the activation are automatically applied to
#' the on-premises servers or VMs.
#' 
#' You can't add tags to or delete tags from an existing activation. You
#' can tag your on-premises servers, edge devices, and VMs after they
#' connect to Systems Manager for the first time and are assigned a managed
#' node ID. This means they are listed in the Amazon Web Services Systems
#' Manager console with an ID that is prefixed with "mi-". For information
#' about how to add tags to your managed nodes, see
#' [`add_tags_to_resource`][ssm_add_tags_to_resource]. For information

#' A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain
#' on your managed nodes
#'
#' @description
#' A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain on your managed nodes. For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and running on your managed nodes, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when new managed nodes are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_association/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_association/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains
#' the configuration information for the managed node.
#' 
#' You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you
#' created, or a document that is shared with you from another Amazon Web
#' Services account.
#' 
#' For Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that are shared with you
#' from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete
#' SSM document ARN, in the following format:
#' 
#' `arn:partition:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name `
#' 
#' For example:
#' 
#' `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document`
#' 
#' For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you
#' created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For
#' example, `AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline` or `My-Document`.
#' @param DocumentVersion The document version you want to associate with the targets. Can be a
#' specific version or the default version.
#' 
#' State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new
#' version of a document if that document is shared from another account.
#' State Manager always runs the `default` version of a document if shared
#' from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that
#' a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a
#' new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the
#' document version to `default`.
#' @param InstanceId The managed node ID.
#' 
#' `InstanceId` has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for an
#' association, use the `Targets` parameter. Requests that include the
#' parameter `InstanceID` with Systems Manager documents (SSM documents)
#' that use schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In addition, if you use
#' the parameter `InstanceId`, you can't use the parameters
#' `AssociationName`, `DocumentVersion`, `MaxErrors`, `MaxConcurrency`,
#' `OutputLocation`, or `ScheduleExpression`. To use these parameters, you
#' must use the `Targets` parameter.
#' @param Parameters The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document.
#' @param Targets The targets for the association. You can target managed nodes by using
#' tags, Amazon Web Services resource groups, all managed nodes in an
#' Amazon Web Services account, or individual managed node IDs. You can
#' target all managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account by specifying
#' the `InstanceIds` key with a value of `*`. For more information about
#' choosing targets for an association, see [Understanding targets and rate
#' controls in State Manager
#' associations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-state-manager-targets-and-rate-controls.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param ScheduleExpression A cron expression when the association will be applied to the targets.
#' @param OutputLocation An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where you want to
#' store the output details of the request.
#' @param AssociationName Specify a descriptive name for the association.
#' @param AutomationTargetParameterName Choose the parameter that will define how your automation will branch
#' out. This target is required for associations that use an Automation
#' runbook and target resources by using rate controls. Automation is a
#' tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.
#' @param MaxErrors The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending
#' requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify
#' either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of
#' the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the
#' system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you
#' specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error
#' is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set
#' `MaxError` to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the
#' sixth error is received.
#' 
#' Executions that are already running an association when `MaxErrors` is
#' reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail
#' as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors
#' failed executions, set `MaxConcurrency` to 1 so that executions proceed
#' one at a time.
#' @param MaxConcurrency The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same
#' time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the
#' target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all
#' targets run the association at the same time.
#' 
#' If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while
#' Systems Manager is running `MaxConcurrency` associations, the
#' association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the
#' new managed node will process its association within the limit specified
#' for `MaxConcurrency`.
#' @param ComplianceSeverity The severity level to assign to the association.
#' @param SyncCompliance The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify `AUTO`
#' or `MANUAL`. In `AUTO` mode, the system uses the status of the
#' association execution to determine the compliance status. If the
#' association execution runs successfully, then the association is
#' `COMPLIANT`. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the
#' association is `NON-COMPLIANT`.
#' 
#' In `MANUAL` mode, you must specify the `AssociationId` as a parameter
#' for the [`put_compliance_items`][ssm_put_compliance_items] API
#' operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager.
#' It is managed by your direct call to the
#' [`put_compliance_items`][ssm_put_compliance_items] API operation.
#' 
#' By default, all associations use `AUTO` mode.
#' @param ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval By default, when you create a new association, the system runs it
#' immediately after it is created and then according to the schedule you
#' specified and when target changes are detected. Specify `true` for
#' `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`if you want the association to run only
#' according to the schedule you specified.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Understanding when associations are applied
#' to
#' resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#state-manager-about-scheduling)
#' and [\>About target updates with Automation
#' runbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#runbook-target-updates)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.
#' @param CalendarNames The names of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar type
#' documents you want to gate your associations under. The associations
#' only run when that change calendar is open. For more information, see
#' [Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change
#' Calendar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param TargetLocations A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon
#' Web Services accounts where you want to run the association. Use this
#' action to create an association in multiple Regions and multiple
#' accounts.
#' 
#' The `IncludeChildOrganizationUnits` parameter is not supported by State
#' Manager.
#' @param ScheduleOffset Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association.
#' For example, if you specified a cron schedule of
#' `cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *)`, you could specify an offset of 3 to run the
#' association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more
#' information about cron schedules for associations, see [Reference: Cron
#' and rate expressions for Systems
#' Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/reference-cron-and-rate-expressions.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' 
#' To use offsets, you must specify the `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`
#' parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association
#' immediately after you create it.
#' @param Duration The number of hours the association can run before it is canceled.
#' Duration applies to associations that are currently running, and any
#' pending and in progress commands on all targets. If a target was taken
#' offline for the association to run, it is made available again
#' immediately, without a reboot.
#' 
#' The `Duration` parameter applies only when both these conditions are
#' true:
#' 
#' -   The association for which you specify a duration is cancelable
#'     according to the parameters of the SSM command document or
#'     Automation runbook associated with this execution.
#' 
#' -   The command specifies the ` ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval ` parameter,
#'     which means that the association doesn't run immediately after it is
#'     created, but only according to the specified schedule.
#' @param TargetMaps A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
#' Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.
#' @param Tags Adds or overwrites one or more tags for a State Manager association.
#' *Tags* are metadata that you can assign to your Amazon Web Services
#' resources. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different
#' ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists
#' of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

#' 
#' -   [Create an SSM document
#'     (API)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/documents-using.html#create-ssm-document-api)
#' @param Requires A list of SSM documents required by a document. This parameter is used
#' exclusively by AppConfig. When a user creates an AppConfig configuration
#' in an SSM document, the user must also specify a required document for
#' validation purposes. In this case, an `ApplicationConfiguration`
#' document requires an `ApplicationConfigurationSchema` document for
#' validation purposes. For more information, see [What is
#' AppConfig?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html)
#' in the *AppConfig User Guide*.
#' @param Attachments A list of key-value pairs that describe attachments to a version of a
#' document.
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; A name for the SSM document.
#' 
#' You can't use the following strings as document name prefixes. These are
#' reserved by Amazon Web Services for use as document name prefixes:
#' 
#' -   `aws`
#' 
#' -   `amazon`
#' 
#' -   `amzn`
#' 
#' -   `AWSEC2`
#' 
#' -   `AWSConfigRemediation`
#' 
#' -   `AWSSupport`
#' @param DisplayName An optional field where you can specify a friendly name for the SSM
#' document. This value can differ for each version of the document. You
#' can update this value at a later time using the
#' [`update_document`][ssm_update_document] operation.
#' @param VersionName An optional field specifying the version of the artifact you are
#' creating with the document. For example, `Release12.1`. This value is
#' unique across all versions of a document, and can't be changed.
#' @param DocumentType The type of document to create.
#' 
#' The `DeploymentStrategy` document type is an internal-use-only document
#' type reserved for AppConfig.
#' @param DocumentFormat Specify the document format for the request. The document format can be
#' JSON, YAML, or TEXT. JSON is the default format.
#' @param TargetType Specify a target type to define the kinds of resources the document can
#' run on. For example, to run a document on EC2 instances, specify the
#' following value: `/AWS::EC2::Instance`. If you specify a value of '/'
#' the document can run on all types of resources. If you don't specify a
#' value, the document can't run on any resources. For a list of valid
#' resource types, see [Amazon Web Services resource and property types
#' reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)
#' in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.
#' @param Tags Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to
#' categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or
#' environment. For example, you might want to tag an SSM document to
#' identify the types of targets or the environment where it will run. In
#' this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:
#' 
#' -   `Key=OS,Value=Windows`
#' 
#' -   `Key=Environment,Value=Production`
#' 
#' To add tags to an existing SSM document, use the

#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_maintenance_window/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_maintenance_window/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; The name of the maintenance window.
#' @param Description An optional description for the maintenance window. We recommend
#' specifying a description to help you organize your maintenance windows.
#' @param StartDate The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the
#' maintenance window to become active. `StartDate` allows you to delay
#' activation of the maintenance window until the specified future date.
#' 
#' When using a rate schedule, if you provide a start date that occurs in
#' the past, the current date and time are used as the start date.
#' @param EndDate The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the
#' maintenance window to become inactive. `EndDate` allows you to set a
#' date and time in the future when the maintenance window will no longer
#' run.
#' @param Schedule &#91;required&#93; The schedule of the maintenance window in the form of a cron or rate
#' expression.
#' @param ScheduleTimezone The time zone that the scheduled maintenance window executions are based
#' on, in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) format. For example:
#' "America/Los_Angeles", "UTC", or "Asia/Seoul". For more information, see
#' the [Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) on the IANA
#' website.
#' @param ScheduleOffset The number of days to wait after the date and time specified by a cron
#' expression before running the maintenance window.
#' 
#' For example, the following cron expression schedules a maintenance
#' window to run on the third Tuesday of every month at 11:30 PM.
#' 
#' `cron(30 23 ? * TUE#3 *)`
#' 
#' If the schedule offset is `2`, the maintenance window won't run until
#' two days later.
#' @param Duration &#91;required&#93; The duration of the maintenance window in hours.
#' @param Cutoff &#91;required&#93; The number of hours before the end of the maintenance window that Amazon
#' Web Services Systems Manager stops scheduling new tasks for execution.
#' @param AllowUnassociatedTargets &#91;required&#93; Enables a maintenance window task to run on managed nodes, even if you
#' haven't registered those nodes as targets. If enabled, then you must
#' specify the unregistered managed nodes (by node ID) when you register a
#' task with the maintenance window.
#' 
#' If you don't enable this option, then you must specify
#' previously-registered targets when you register a task with the
#' maintenance window.
#' @param ClientToken User-provided idempotency token.
#' @param Tags Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to
#' categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or
#' environment. For example, you might want to tag a maintenance window to
#' identify the type of tasks it will run, the types of targets, and the

#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_ops_item/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_ops_item/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Description &#91;required&#93; User-defined text that contains information about the OpsItem, in
#' Markdown format.
#' 
#' Provide enough information so that users viewing this OpsItem for the
#' first time understand the issue.
#' @param OpsItemType The type of OpsItem to create. Systems Manager supports the following
#' types of OpsItems:
#' 
#' -   `/aws/issue`
#' 
#'     This type of OpsItem is used for default OpsItems created by
#'     OpsCenter.
#' 
#' -   `/aws/insight`
#' 
#'     This type of OpsItem is used by OpsCenter for aggregating and
#'     reporting on duplicate OpsItems.
#' 
#' -   `/aws/changerequest`
#' 
#'     This type of OpsItem is used by Change Manager for reviewing and
#'     approving or rejecting change requests.
#' 
#'     Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Manager will no longer be
#'     open to new customers starting November 7, 2025. If you would like
#'     to use Change Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing
#'     customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more
#'     information, see [Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Manager

#' `amzn`, `ssm`, `/amazon`, `/aws`, `/amzn`, `/ssm`.
#' 
#' You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the account
#' or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that all users
#' with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the
#' [`describe_ops_items`][ssm_describe_ops_items] API operation) can view
#' and search on the specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable
#' is only viewable by users who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by
#' the [`get_ops_item`][ssm_get_ops_item] API operation).
#' 
#' Use the `/aws/resources` key in OperationalData to specify a related
#' resource in the request. Use the `/aws/automations` key in
#' OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To
#' view Amazon Web Services CLI example commands that use these keys, see
#' [Create OpsItems
#' manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-manually-create-OpsItems.html)

#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_patch_baseline/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_create_patch_baseline/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param OperatingSystem Defines the operating system the patch baseline applies to. The default
#' value is `WINDOWS`.
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; The name of the patch baseline.
#' @param GlobalFilters A set of global filters used to include patches in the baseline.
#' 
#' The `GlobalFilters` parameter can be configured only by using the CLI or
#' an Amazon Web Services SDK. It can't be configured from the Patch
#' Manager console, and its value isn't displayed in the console.
#' @param ApprovalRules A set of rules used to include patches in the baseline.
#' @param ApprovedPatches A list of explicitly approved patches for the baseline.
#' 
#' For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and
#' rejected patches, see [Package name formats for approved and rejected
#' patch
#' lists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-approved-rejected-package-name-formats.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param ApprovedPatchesComplianceLevel Defines the compliance level for approved patches. When an approved
#' patch is reported as missing, this value describes the severity of the
#' compliance violation. The default value is `UNSPECIFIED`.
#' @param ApprovedPatchesEnableNonSecurity Indicates whether the list of approved patches includes non-security
#' updates that should be applied to the managed nodes. The default value
#' is `false`. Applies to Linux managed nodes only.
#' @param RejectedPatches A list of explicitly rejected patches for the baseline.
#' 
#' For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and
#' rejected patches, see [Package name formats for approved and rejected
#' patch
#' lists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-approved-rejected-package-name-formats.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param RejectedPatchesAction The action for Patch Manager to take on patches included in the
#' `RejectedPackages` list.
#' 
#' **ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY**
#' 
#' **Linux and macOS**: A package in the rejected patches list is installed
#' only if it is a dependency of another package. It is considered
#' compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as
#' `INSTALLED_OTHER`. This is the default action if no option is specified.
#' 
#' **Windows Server**: Windows Server doesn't support the concept of
#' package dependencies. If a package in the rejected patches list and
#' already installed on the node, its status is reported as
#' `INSTALLED_OTHER`. Any package not already installed on the node is
#' skipped. This is the default action if no option is specified.
#' 
#' **BLOCK**
#' 
#' **All OSs**: Packages in the rejected patches list, and packages that
#' include them as dependencies, aren't installed by Patch Manager under
#' any circumstances.
#' 
#' State value assignment for patch compliance:
#' 
#' -   If a package was installed before it was added to the rejected
#'     patches list, or is installed outside of Patch Manager afterward,
#'     it's considered noncompliant with the patch baseline and its status
#'     is reported as `INSTALLED_REJECTED`.
#' 
#' -   If an update attempts to install a dependency package that is now
#'     rejected by the baseline, when previous versions of the package were
#'     not rejected, the package being updated is reported as `MISSING` for
#'     `SCAN` operations and as `FAILED` for `INSTALL` operations.
#' @param Description A description of the patch baseline.
#' @param Sources Information about the patches to use to update the managed nodes,
#' including target operating systems and source repositories. Applies to
#' Linux managed nodes only.
#' @param AvailableSecurityUpdatesComplianceStatus Indicates the status you want to assign to security patches that are
#' available but not approved because they don't meet the installation
#' criteria specified in the patch baseline.
#' 
#' Example scenario: Security patches that you might want installed can be
#' skipped if you have specified a long period to wait after a patch is
#' released before installation. If an update to the patch is released
#' during your specified waiting period, the waiting period for installing
#' the patch starts over. If the waiting period is too long, multiple
#' versions of the patch could be released but never installed.
#' 
#' Supported for Windows Server managed nodes only.
#' @param ClientToken User-provided idempotency token.
#' @param Tags Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to
#' categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or
#' environment. For example, you might want to tag a patch baseline to
#' identify the severity level of patches it specifies and the operating

#'
#' @param TypeName &#91;required&#93; The name of the custom inventory type for which you want to delete
#' either all previously collected data or the inventory type itself.
#' @param SchemaDeleteOption Use the `SchemaDeleteOption` to delete a custom inventory type (schema).
#' If you don't choose this option, the system only deletes existing
#' inventory data associated with the custom inventory type. Choose one of
#' the following options:
#' 
#' DisableSchema: If you choose this option, the system ignores all
#' inventory data for the specified version, and any earlier versions. To
#' enable this schema again, you must call the
#' [`put_inventory`][ssm_put_inventory] operation for a version greater
#' than the disabled version.
#' 
#' DeleteSchema: This option deletes the specified custom type from the
#' Inventory service. You can recreate the schema later, if you want.
#' @param DryRun Use this option to view a summary of the deletion request without
#' deleting any data or the data type. This option is useful when you only
#' want to understand what will be deleted. Once you validate that the data
#' to be deleted is what you intend to delete, you can run the same command
#' without specifying the `DryRun` option.

#' ServiceSetting is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services

#'
#' @description
#' `ServiceSetting` is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of `false`. This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to `true` and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.

#'
#' @param DocumentFilterList This data type is deprecated. Instead, use `Filters`.
#' @param Filters One or more `DocumentKeyValuesFilter` objects. Use a filter to return a

#' `Key=Owner,Values=Self`. To specify a custom key-value pair, use the
#' format `Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName`.
#' 
#' This API operation only supports filtering documents by using a single

#' Create or update a parameter in Parameter Store.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_put_parameter/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_put_parameter/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; The fully qualified name of the parameter that you want to create or
#' update.
#' 
#' You can't enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a parameter, only the
#' parameter name itself.
#' 
#' The fully qualified name includes the complete hierarchy of the
#' parameter path and name. For parameters in a hierarchy, you must include
#' a leading forward slash character (/) when you create or reference a
#' parameter. For example: `/Dev/DBServer/MySQL/db-string13`
#' 
#' Naming Constraints:
#' 
#' -   Parameter names are case sensitive.
#' 
#' -   A parameter name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region
#' 
#' -   A parameter name can't be prefixed with "`aws`" or "`ssm`"
#'     (case-insensitive).
#' 
#' -   Parameter names can include only the following symbols and letters:
#'     `a-zA-Z0-9_.-`
#' 
#'     In addition, the slash character ( / ) is used to delineate
#'     hierarchies in parameter names. For example:
#'     `/Dev/Production/East/Project-ABC/MyParameter`
#' 
#' -   Parameter names can't contain spaces. The service removes any spaces
#'     specified for the beginning or end of a parameter name. If the
#'     specified name for a parameter contains spaces between characters,
#'     the request fails with a `ValidationException` error.
#' 
#' -   Parameter hierarchies are limited to a maximum depth of fifteen
#'     levels.
#' 
#' For additional information about valid values for parameter names, see
#' [Creating Systems Manager
#' parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-su-create.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' 
#' The reported maximum length of 2048 characters for a parameter name
#' includes 1037 characters that are reserved for internal use by Systems
#' Manager. The maximum length for a parameter name that you specify is
#' 1011 characters.
#' 
#' This count of 1011 characters includes the characters in the ARN that
#' precede the name you specify. This ARN length will vary depending on
#' your partition and Region. For example, the following 45 characters
#' count toward the 1011 character maximum for a parameter created in the
#' US East (Ohio) Region: `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:parameter/`.
#' @param Description Information about the parameter that you want to add to the system.
#' Optional but recommended.
#' 
#' Don't enter personally identifiable information in this field.
#' @param Value &#91;required&#93; The parameter value that you want to add to the system. Standard
#' parameters have a value limit of 4 KB. Advanced parameters have a value
#' limit of 8 KB.
#' 
#' Parameters can't be referenced or nested in the values of other
#' parameters. You can't include values wrapped in double brackets `{{}}`
#' or `{{ssm:parameter-name}}` in a parameter value.
#' @param Type The type of parameter that you want to create.
#' 
#' `SecureString` isn't currently supported for CloudFormation templates.
#' 
#' Items in a `StringList` must be separated by a comma (,). You can't use
#' other punctuation or special character to escape items in the list. If
#' you have a parameter value that requires a comma, then use the `String`
#' data type.
#' 
#' Specifying a parameter type isn't required when updating a parameter.
#' You must specify a parameter type when creating a parameter.
#' @param KeyId The Key Management Service (KMS) ID that you want to use to encrypt a
#' parameter. Use a custom key for better security. Required for parameters
#' that use the `SecureString` data type.
#' 
#' If you don't specify a key ID, the system uses the default key
#' associated with your Amazon Web Services account, which is not as secure
#' as using a custom key.
#' 
#' -   To use a custom KMS key, choose the `SecureString` data type with
#'     the `Key ID` parameter.
#' @param Overwrite Overwrite an existing parameter. The default value is `false`.
#' @param AllowedPattern A regular expression used to validate the parameter value. For example,
#' for String types with values restricted to numbers, you can specify the
#' following: AllowedPattern=^\\d+$
#' @param Tags Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to
#' categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or
#' environment. For example, you might want to tag a Systems Manager
#' parameter to identify the type of resource to which it applies, the
#' environment, or the type of configuration data referenced by the
#' parameter. In this case, you could specify the following key-value
#' pairs:
#' 
#' -   `Key=Resource,Value=S3bucket`
#' 
#' -   `Key=OS,Value=Windows`
#' 
#' -   `Key=ParameterType,Value=LicenseKey`
#' 
#' To add tags to an existing Systems Manager parameter, use the
#' [`add_tags_to_resource`][ssm_add_tags_to_resource] operation.
#' @param Tier The parameter tier to assign to a parameter.
#' 
#' Parameter Store offers a standard tier and an advanced tier for
#' parameters. Standard parameters have a content size limit of 4 KB and
#' can't be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum
#' of 10,000 standard parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services
#' account. Standard parameters are offered at no additional cost.
#' 
#' Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be
#' configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of
#' 100,000 advanced parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services
#' account. Advanced parameters incur a charge. For more information, see
#' [Managing parameter
#' tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-advanced-parameters.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' 
#' You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any time.
#' But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter.
#' Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in
#' data loss because the system would truncate the size of the parameter
#' from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to
#' the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of
#' encryption than standard parameters.
#' 
#' If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to
#' incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate
#' it as a new standard parameter.
#' 
#' **Using the Default Tier Configuration**
#' 
#' In [`put_parameter`][ssm_put_parameter] requests, you can specify the
#' tier to create the parameter in. Whenever you specify a tier in the
#' request, Parameter Store creates or updates the parameter according to
#' that request. However, if you don't specify a tier in a request,
#' Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store
#' default tier configuration.
#' 
#' The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the
#' standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can
#' specify one of the following as the default:
#' 
#' -   **Advanced**: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all
#'     requests as advanced parameters.
#' 
#' -   **Intelligent-Tiering**: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates
#'     each request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced.
#' 
#'     If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced
#'     parameter, the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier.
#'     If one or more options requiring an advanced parameter are included
#'     in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in the
#'     advanced-parameter tier.
#' 
#'     This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always
#'     creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is
#'     necessary.
#' 
#' Options that require an advanced parameter include the following:
#' 
#' -   The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.
#' 
#' -   The parameter uses a parameter policy.
#' 
#' -   More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your Amazon Web
#'     Services account in the current Amazon Web Services Region.
#' 
#' For more information about configuring the default tier option, see
#' [Specifying a default parameter
#' tier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-advanced-parameters.html#ps-default-tier)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param Policies One or more policies to apply to a parameter. This operation takes a
#' JSON array. Parameter Store, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems
#' Manager supports the following policy types:
#' 
#' Expiration: This policy deletes the parameter after it expires. When you
#' create the policy, you specify the expiration date. You can update the
#' expiration date and time by updating the policy. Updating the
#' *parameter* doesn't affect the expiration date and time. When the
#' expiration time is reached, Parameter Store deletes the parameter.
#' 
#' ExpirationNotification: This policy initiates an event in Amazon
#' CloudWatch Events that notifies you about the expiration. By using this
#' policy, you can receive notification before or after the expiration time
#' is reached, in units of days or hours.
#' 
#' NoChangeNotification: This policy initiates a CloudWatch Events event if
#' a parameter hasn't been modified for a specified period of time. This
#' policy type is useful when, for example, a secret needs to be changed
#' within a period of time, but it hasn't been changed.
#' 
#' All existing policies are preserved until you send new policies or an
#' empty policy. For more information about parameter policies, see
#' [Assigning parameter
#' policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-policies.html).
#' @param DataType The data type for a `String` parameter. Supported data types include
#' plain text and Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs.
#' 
#' **The following data type values are supported.**
#' 
#' -   `text`
#' 
#' -   `aws:ec2:image`
#' 
#' -   `aws:ssm:integration`
#' 
#' When you create a `String` parameter and specify `aws:ec2:image`, Amazon
#' Web Services Systems Manager validates the parameter value is in the
#' required format, such as `ami-12345abcdeEXAMPLE`, and that the specified
#' AMI is available in your Amazon Web Services account.
#' 
#' If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response
#' which indicates a successful [`put_parameter`][ssm_put_parameter] call
#' for all cases except for data type `aws:ec2:image`. If you call
#' [`put_parameter`][ssm_put_parameter] with `aws:ec2:image` data type, a
#' successful HTTP 200 response does not guarantee that your parameter was
#' successfully created or updated. The `aws:ec2:image` value is validated
#' asynchronously, and the [`put_parameter`][ssm_put_parameter] call
#' returns before the validation is complete. If you submit an invalid AMI
#' value, the PutParameter operation will return success, but the
#' asynchronous validation will fail and the parameter will not be created
#' or updated. To monitor whether your `aws:ec2:image` parameters are
#' created successfully, see [Setting up notifications or trigger actions
#' based on Parameter Store
#' events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-cwe.html).
#' For more information about AMI format validation , see [Native parameter
#' support for Amazon Machine Image
#' IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-ec2-aliases.html).

#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_register_target_with_maintenance_window/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_register_target_with_maintenance_window/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param WindowId &#91;required&#93; The ID of the maintenance window the target should be registered with.
#' @param ResourceType &#91;required&#93; The type of target being registered with the maintenance window.
#' @param Targets &#91;required&#93; The targets to register with the maintenance window. In other words, the
#' managed nodes to run commands on when the maintenance window runs.
#' 
#' If a single maintenance window task is registered with multiple targets,
#' its task invocations occur sequentially and not in parallel. If your
#' task must run on multiple targets at the same time, register a task for
#' each target individually and assign each task the same priority level.
#' 
#' You can specify targets using managed node IDs, resource group names, or
#' tags that have been applied to managed nodes.
#' 
#' **Example 1**: Specify managed node IDs
#' 
#' `Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>`
#' 
#' **Example 2**: Use tag key-pairs applied to managed nodes
#' 
#' `Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>`
#' 
#' **Example 3**: Use tag-keys applied to managed nodes
#' 
#' `Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>`
#' 
#' **Example 4**: Use resource group names
#' 
#' `Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>`
#' 
#' **Example 5**: Use filters for resource group types
#' 
#' `Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>`
#' 
#' For `Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters`, specify resource types in
#' the following format
#' 
#' `Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC`
#'

#' @description
#' `ServiceSetting` is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.

#' Runs commands on one or more managed nodes
#'
#' @description
#' Runs commands on one or more managed nodes.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_send_command/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_send_command/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param InstanceIds The IDs of the managed nodes where the command should run. Specifying
#' managed node IDs is most useful when you are targeting a limited number
#' of managed nodes, though you can specify up to 50 IDs.
#' 
#' To target a larger number of managed nodes, or if you prefer not to list
#' individual node IDs, we recommend using the `Targets` option instead.
#' Using `Targets`, which accepts tag key-value pairs to identify the
#' managed nodes to send commands to, you can a send command to tens,
#' hundreds, or thousands of nodes at once.
#' 
#' For more information about how to use targets, see [Run commands at
#' scale](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param Targets An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
#' `Key,Value` combination that you specify. Specifying targets is most
#' useful when you want to send a command to a large number of managed
#' nodes at once. Using `Targets`, which accepts tag key-value pairs to
#' identify managed nodes, you can send a command to tens, hundreds, or
#' thousands of nodes at once.
#' 
#' To send a command to a smaller number of managed nodes, you can use the
#' `InstanceIds` option instead.
#' 
#' For more information about how to use targets, see [Run commands at
#' scale](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param DocumentName &#91;required&#93; The name of the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM
#' document) to run. This can be a public document or a custom document. To
#' run a shared document belonging to another account, specify the document
#' Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about how to use shared
#' documents, see [Sharing SSM
#' documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/documents-ssm-sharing.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' 
#' If you specify a document name or ARN that hasn't been shared with your
#' account, you receive an `InvalidDocument` error.
#' @param DocumentVersion The SSM document version to use in the request. You can specify
#' $DEFAULT, $LATEST, or a specific version number. If you run commands by
#' using the Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), then you
#' must escape the first two options by using a backslash. If you specify a
#' version number, then you don't need to use the backslash. For example:
#' 
#' --document-version "$DEFAULT"
#' 
#' --document-version "$LATEST"
#' 
#' --document-version "3"
#' @param DocumentHash The Sha256 or Sha1 hash created by the system when the document was
#' created.
#' 
#' Sha1 hashes have been deprecated.
#' @param DocumentHashType Sha256 or Sha1.
#' 
#' Sha1 hashes have been deprecated.
#' @param TimeoutSeconds If this time is reached and the command hasn't already started running,
#' it won't run.
#' @param Comment User-specified information about the command, such as a brief
#' description of what the command should do.
#' @param Parameters The required and optional parameters specified in the document being
#' run.
#' @param OutputS3Region (Deprecated) You can no longer specify this parameter. The system
#' ignores it. Instead, Systems Manager automatically determines the Amazon
#' Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.
#' @param OutputS3BucketName The name of the S3 bucket where command execution responses should be
#' stored.
#' @param OutputS3KeyPrefix The directory structure within the S3 bucket where the responses should
#' be stored.
#' @param MaxConcurrency (Optional) The maximum number of managed nodes that are allowed to run
#' the command at the same time. You can specify a number such as 10 or a
#' percentage such as 10%. The default value is `50`. For more information
#' about how to use `MaxConcurrency`, see [Using concurrency
#' controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-velocity)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param MaxErrors The maximum number of errors allowed without the command failing. When
#' the command fails one more time beyond the value of `MaxErrors`, the
#' systems stops sending the command to additional targets. You can specify
#' a number like 10 or a percentage like 10%. The default value is `0`. For
#' more information about how to use `MaxErrors`, see [Using error
#' controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-maxerrors)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param ServiceRoleArn The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role to use
#' to publish Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications
#' for Run Command commands.
#' 
#' This role must provide the `sns:Publish` permission for your
#' notification topic. For information about creating and using this

#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_start_automation_execution/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_start_automation_execution/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param DocumentName &#91;required&#93; The name of the SSM document to run. This can be a public document or a
#' custom document. To run a shared document belonging to another account,
#' specify the document ARN. For more information about how to use shared
#' documents, see [Sharing SSM
#' documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/documents-ssm-sharing.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param DocumentVersion The version of the Automation runbook to use for this execution.
#' @param Parameters A key-value map of execution parameters, which match the declared
#' parameters in the Automation runbook.
#' @param ClientToken User-provided idempotency token. The token must be unique, is case
#' insensitive, enforces the UUID format, and can't be reused.
#' @param Mode The execution mode of the automation. Valid modes include the following:
#' Auto and Interactive. The default mode is Auto.
#' @param TargetParameterName The name of the parameter used as the target resource for the
#' rate-controlled execution. Required if you specify targets.
#' @param Targets A key-value mapping to target resources. Required if you specify
#' TargetParameterName.
#' 
#' If both this parameter and the `TargetLocation:Targets` parameter are
#' supplied, `TargetLocation:Targets` takes precedence.
#' @param TargetMaps A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
#' Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.
#' @param MaxConcurrency The maximum number of targets allowed to run this task in parallel. You
#' can specify a number, such as 10, or a percentage, such as 10%. The
#' default value is `10`.
#' 
#' If both this parameter and the `TargetLocation:TargetsMaxConcurrency`
#' are supplied, `TargetLocation:TargetsMaxConcurrency` takes precedence.
#' @param MaxErrors The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops running
#' the automation on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute
#' number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for
#' example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops running the
#' automation when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the
#' system stops running the automation on additional targets after the
#' first error result is returned. If you run an automation on 50 resources
#' and set max-errors to 10%, then the system stops running the automation
#' on additional targets when the sixth error is received.
#' 
#' Executions that are already running an automation when max-errors is
#' reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail
#' as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors
#' failed executions, set max-concurrency to 1 so the executions proceed
#' one at a time.
#' 
#' If this parameter and the `TargetLocation:TargetsMaxErrors` parameter
#' are both supplied, `TargetLocation:TargetsMaxErrors` takes precedence.
#' @param TargetLocations A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and/or Amazon
#' Web Services accounts where you want to run the automation. Use this
#' operation to start an automation in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions
#' and multiple Amazon Web Services accounts. For more information, see
#' [Running automations in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions and
#' accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/running-automations-multiple-accounts-regions.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param Tags Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. You can specify a
#' maximum of five tags for an automation. Tags enable you to categorize a
#' resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment.
#' For example, you might want to tag an automation to identify an
#' environment or operating system. In this case, you could specify the
#' following key-value pairs:
#' 
#' -   `Key=environment,Value=test`
#' 
#' -   `Key=OS,Value=Windows`
#' 
#' The `Array Members` maximum value is reported as 1000. This number
#' includes capacity reserved for internal operations. When calling the
#' [`start_automation_execution`][ssm_start_automation_execution] action,
#' you can specify a maximum of 5 tags. You can, however, use the
#' [`add_tags_to_resource`][ssm_add_tags_to_resource] action to add up to a
#' total of 50 tags to an existing automation configuration.
#' @param AlarmConfiguration The CloudWatch alarm you want to apply to your automation.
#' @param TargetLocationsURL Specify a publicly accessible URL for a file that contains the
#' `TargetLocations` body. Currently, only files in presigned Amazon S3
#' buckets are supported.

#' @param ChangeRequestName The name of the change request associated with the runbook workflow to
#' be run.
#' @param ClientToken The user-provided idempotency token. The token must be unique, is case
#' insensitive, enforces the UUID format, and can't be reused.
#' @param AutoApprove Indicates whether the change request can be approved automatically
#' without the need for manual approvals.
#' 
#' If `AutoApprovable` is enabled in a change template, then setting
#' `AutoApprove` to `true` in
#' [`start_change_request_execution`][ssm_start_change_request_execution]
#' creates a change request that bypasses approver review.
#' 
#' Change Calendar restrictions are not bypassed in this scenario. If the
#' state of an associated calendar is `CLOSED`, change freeze approvers
#' must still grant permission for this change request to run. If they
#' don't, the change won't be processed until the calendar state is again
#' `OPEN`.
#' @param Runbooks &#91;required&#93; Information about the Automation runbooks that are run during the
#' runbook workflow.
#' 
#' The Automation runbooks specified for the runbook workflow can't run
#' until all required approvals for the change request have been received.
#' @param Tags Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. You can specify a
#' maximum of five tags for a change request. Tags enable you to categorize
#' a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment.
#' For example, you might want to tag a change request to identify an
#' environment or target Amazon Web Services Region. In this case, you
#' could specify the following key-value pairs:
#' 
#' -   `Key=Environment,Value=Production`
#' 
#' -   `Key=Region,Value=us-east-2`
#' 
#' The `Array Members` maximum value is reported as 1000. This number
#' includes capacity reserved for internal operations. When calling the
#' [`start_change_request_execution`][ssm_start_change_request_execution]
#' action, you can specify a maximum of 5 tags. You can, however, use the
#' [`add_tags_to_resource`][ssm_add_tags_to_resource] action to add up to a
#' total of 50 tags to an existing change request configuration.
#' @param ScheduledEndTime The time that the requester expects the runbook workflow related to the
#' change request to complete. The time is an estimate only that the
#' requester provides for reviewers.
#' @param ChangeDetails User-provided details about the change. If no details are provided,
#' content specified in the **Template information** section of the
#' associated change template is added.

#' Updates an association
#'
#' @description
#' Updates an association. You can update the association name and version, the document version, schedule, parameters, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) output. When you call [`update_association`][ssm_update_association], the system removes all optional parameters from the request and overwrites the association with null values for those parameters. This is by design. You must specify all optional parameters in the call, even if you are not changing the parameters. This includes the `Name` parameter. Before calling this API action, we recommend that you call the [`describe_association`][ssm_describe_association] API operation and make a note of all optional parameters required for your [`update_association`][ssm_update_association] call.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_update_association/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_update_association/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param AssociationId &#91;required&#93; The ID of the association you want to update.
#' @param Parameters The parameters you want to update for the association. If you create a
#' parameter using Parameter Store, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems
#' Manager, you can reference the parameter using `{{ssm:parameter-name}}`.
#' @param DocumentVersion The document version you want update for the association.
#' 
#' State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new
#' version of a document if that document is shared from another account.
#' State Manager always runs the `default` version of a document if shared
#' from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that
#' a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a
#' new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the
#' document version to `default`.
#' @param ScheduleExpression The cron expression used to schedule the association that you want to
#' update.
#' @param OutputLocation An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request.
#' @param Name The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains
#' the configuration information for the managed node.
#' 
#' You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you
#' created, or a document that is shared with you from another account.
#' 
#' For Systems Manager document (SSM document) that are shared with you
#' from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete
#' SSM document ARN, in the following format:
#' 
#' `arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name `
#' 
#' For example:
#' 
#' `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document`
#' 
#' For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you
#' created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For
#' example, `AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline` or `My-Document`.
#' @param Targets The targets of the association.
#' @param AssociationName The name of the association that you want to update.
#' @param AssociationVersion This parameter is provided for concurrency control purposes. You must
#' specify the latest association version in the service. If you want to
#' ensure that this request succeeds, either specify `$LATEST`, or omit
#' this parameter.
#' @param AutomationTargetParameterName Choose the parameter that will define how your automation will branch
#' out. This target is required for associations that use an Automation
#' runbook and target resources by using rate controls. Automation is a
#' tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.
#' @param MaxErrors The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending
#' requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify
#' either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of
#' the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the
#' system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you
#' specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error
#' is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set
#' `MaxError` to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the
#' sixth error is received.
#' 
#' Executions that are already running an association when `MaxErrors` is
#' reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail
#' as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors
#' failed executions, set `MaxConcurrency` to 1 so that executions proceed
#' one at a time.
#' @param MaxConcurrency The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same
#' time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the
#' target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all
#' targets run the association at the same time.
#' 
#' If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while
#' Systems Manager is running `MaxConcurrency` associations, the
#' association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the
#' new managed node will process its association within the limit specified
#' for `MaxConcurrency`.
#' @param ComplianceSeverity The severity level to assign to the association.
#' @param SyncCompliance The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify `AUTO`
#' or `MANUAL`. In `AUTO` mode, the system uses the status of the
#' association execution to determine the compliance status. If the
#' association execution runs successfully, then the association is
#' `COMPLIANT`. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the
#' association is `NON-COMPLIANT`.
#' 
#' In `MANUAL` mode, you must specify the `AssociationId` as a parameter
#' for the [`put_compliance_items`][ssm_put_compliance_items] API
#' operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager,
#' a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by your
#' direct call to the [`put_compliance_items`][ssm_put_compliance_items]
#' API operation.
#' 
#' By default, all associations use `AUTO` mode.
#' @param ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval By default, when you update an association, the system runs it
#' immediately after it is updated and then according to the schedule you
#' specified. Specify `true` for `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval` if you want the
#' association to run only according to the schedule you specified.
#' 
#' If you chose this option when you created an association and later you
#' edit that association or you make changes to the Automation runbook or
#' SSM document on which that association is based, State Manager applies
#' the association at the next specified cron interval. For example, if you
#' chose the `Latest` version of an SSM document when you created an
#' association and you edit the association by choosing a different
#' document version on the Documents page, State Manager applies the
#' association at the next specified cron interval if you previously set
#' `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval` to `true`. If this option wasn't selected,
#' State Manager immediately runs the association.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Understanding when associations are applied
#' to
#' resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#state-manager-about-scheduling)
#' and [About target updates with Automation
#' runbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#runbook-target-updates)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.
#' 
#' You can reset this parameter. To do so, specify the
#' `no-apply-only-at-cron-interval` parameter when you update the
#' association from the command line. This parameter forces the association
#' to run immediately after updating it and according to the interval
#' specified.
#' @param CalendarNames The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar type
#' documents you want to gate your associations under. The associations
#' only run when that change calendar is open. For more information, see
#' [Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change
#' Calendar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param TargetLocations A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon
#' Web Services accounts where you want to run the association. Use this
#' action to update an association in multiple Regions and multiple
#' accounts.
#' 
#' The `IncludeChildOrganizationUnits` parameter is not supported by State
#' Manager.
#' @param ScheduleOffset Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association.
#' For example, if you specified a cron schedule of
#' `cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *)`, you could specify an offset of 3 to run the
#' association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more
#' information about cron schedules for associations, see [Reference: Cron
#' and rate expressions for Systems
#' Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/reference-cron-and-rate-expressions.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' 
#' To use offsets, you must specify the `ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`
#' parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association
#' immediately after you create it.
#' @param Duration The number of hours the association can run before it is canceled.
#' Duration applies to associations that are currently running, and any
#' pending and in progress commands on all targets. If a target was taken
#' offline for the association to run, it is made available again
#' immediately, without a reboot.
#' 
#' The `Duration` parameter applies only when both these conditions are
#' true:
#' 
#' -   The association for which you specify a duration is cancelable
#'     according to the parameters of the SSM command document or
#'     Automation runbook associated with this execution.
#' 
#' -   The command specifies the ` ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval ` parameter,
#'     which means that the association doesn't run immediately after it is
#'     updated, but only according to the specified schedule.
#' @param TargetMaps A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
#' Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.
#' @param AlarmConfiguration

#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_update_maintenance_window/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_update_maintenance_window/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param WindowId &#91;required&#93; The ID of the maintenance window to update.
#' @param Name The name of the maintenance window.
#' @param Description An optional description for the update request.
#' @param StartDate The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the
#' maintenance window to become active. `StartDate` allows you to delay

#' 
#' When using a rate schedule, if you provide a start date that occurs in
#' the past, the current date and time are used as the start date.
#' @param EndDate The date and time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want the

#' Modifies a task assigned to a maintenance window

#' @description
#' Modifies a task assigned to a maintenance window. You can't change the task type, but you can change the following values:
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_update_maintenance_window_task/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_update_maintenance_window_task/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param WindowId &#91;required&#93; The maintenance window ID that contains the task to modify.
#' @param WindowTaskId &#91;required&#93; The task ID to modify.
#' @param Targets The targets (either managed nodes or tags) to modify. Managed nodes are
#' specified using the format
#' `Key=instanceids,Values=instanceID_1,instanceID_2`. Tags are specified
#' using the format ` Key=tag_name,Values=tag_value`.
#' 
#' One or more targets must be specified for maintenance window Run
#' Command-type tasks. Depending on the task, targets are optional for
#' other maintenance window task types (Automation, Lambda, and Step
#' Functions). For more information about running tasks that don't specify
#' targets, see [Registering maintenance window tasks without
#' targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/maintenance-windows-targetless-tasks.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param TaskArn The task ARN to modify.
#' @param ServiceRoleArn The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role for Amazon Web
#' Services Systems Manager to assume when running a maintenance window
#' task. If you do not specify a service role ARN, Systems Manager uses a
#' service-linked role in your account. If no appropriate service-linked
#' role for Systems Manager exists in your account, it is created when you
#' run
#' [`register_task_with_maintenance_window`][ssm_register_task_with_maintenance_window].
#' 
#' However, for an improved security posture, we strongly recommend
#' creating a custom policy and custom service role for running your
#' maintenance window tasks. The policy can be crafted to provide only the
#' permissions needed for your particular maintenance window tasks. For
#' more information, see [Setting up Maintenance
#' Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setting-up-maintenance-windows.html)
#' in the in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param TaskParameters The parameters to modify.
#' 
#' `TaskParameters` has been deprecated. To specify parameters to pass to a
#' task when it runs, instead use the `Parameters` option in the
#' `TaskInvocationParameters` structure. For information about how Systems
#' Manager handles these options for the supported maintenance window task
#' types, see MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters.
#' 
#' The map has the following format:
#' 
#' Key: string, between 1 and 255 characters
#' 
#' Value: an array of strings, each string is between 1 and 255 characters
#' @param TaskInvocationParameters The parameters that the task should use during execution. Populate only
#' the fields that match the task type. All other fields should be empty.
#' 
#' When you update a maintenance window task that has options specified in
#' `TaskInvocationParameters`, you must provide again all the
#' `TaskInvocationParameters` values that you want to retain. The values
#' you don't specify again are removed. For example, suppose that when you
#' registered a Run Command task, you specified `TaskInvocationParameters`
#' values for `Comment`, `NotificationConfig`, and `OutputS3BucketName`. If
#' you update the maintenance window task and specify only a different
#' `OutputS3BucketName` value, the values for `Comment` and
#' `NotificationConfig` are removed.
#' @param Priority The new task priority to specify. The lower the number, the higher the
#' priority. Tasks that have the same priority are scheduled in parallel.
#' @param MaxConcurrency The new `MaxConcurrency` value you want to specify. `MaxConcurrency` is
#' the number of targets that are allowed to run this task, in parallel.
#' 
#' Although this element is listed as "Required: No", a value can be
#' omitted only when you are registering or updating a [targetless
#' task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/maintenance-windows-targetless-tasks.html)
#' You must provide a value in all other cases.
#' 
#' For maintenance window tasks without a target specified, you can't
#' supply a value for this option. Instead, the system inserts a
#' placeholder value of `1`. This value doesn't affect the running of your
#' task.
#' @param MaxErrors The new `MaxErrors` value to specify. `MaxErrors` is the maximum number
#' of errors that are allowed before the task stops being scheduled.
#' 
#' Although this element is listed as "Required: No", a value can be
#' omitted only when you are registering or updating a [targetless
#' task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/maintenance-windows-targetless-tasks.html)

#' 
#' For maintenance window tasks without a target specified, you can't
#' supply a value for this option. Instead, the system inserts a
#' placeholder value of `1`. This value doesn't affect the running of your
#' task.
#' @param LoggingInfo The new logging location in Amazon S3 to specify.
#' 
#' `LoggingInfo` has been deprecated. To specify an Amazon Simple Storage
#' Service (Amazon S3) bucket to contain logs, instead use the
#' `OutputS3BucketName` and `OutputS3KeyPrefix` options in the
#' `TaskInvocationParameters` structure. For information about how Amazon
#' Web Services Systems Manager handles these options for the supported
#' maintenance window task types, see
#' MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters.
#' @param Name The new task name to specify.
#' @param Description The new task description to specify.
#' @param Replace If True, then all fields that are required by the
#' [`register_task_with_maintenance_window`][ssm_register_task_with_maintenance_window]
#' operation are also required for this API request. Optional fields that
#' aren't specified are set to null.
#' @param CutoffBehavior Indicates whether tasks should continue to run after the cutoff time
#' specified in the maintenance windows is reached.
#' 
#' -   `CONTINUE_TASK`: When the cutoff time is reached, any tasks that are
#'     running continue. The default value.
#' 
#' -   `CANCEL_TASK`:
#' 
#'     -   For Automation, Lambda, Step Functions tasks: When the cutoff
#'         time is reached, any task invocations that are already running
#'         continue, but no new task invocations are started.
#' 
#'     -   For Run Command tasks: When the cutoff time is reached, the
#'         system sends a [`cancel_command`][ssm_cancel_command] operation
#'         that attempts to cancel the command associated with the task.
#'         However, there is no guarantee that the command will be
#'         terminated and the underlying process stopped.
#' 
#'     The status for tasks that are not completed is `TIMED_OUT`.

#' @param ApprovedPatchesEnableNonSecurity Indicates whether the list of approved patches includes non-security
#' updates that should be applied to the managed nodes. The default value
#' is `false`. Applies to Linux managed nodes only.
#' @param RejectedPatches A list of explicitly rejected patches for the baseline.
#' 
#' For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and
#' rejected patches, see [Package name formats for approved and rejected
#' patch
#' lists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-approved-rejected-package-name-formats.html)
#' in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
#' @param RejectedPatchesAction The action for Patch Manager to take on patches included in the
#' `RejectedPackages` list.
#' 
#' **ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY**
#' 
#' **Linux and macOS**: A package in the rejected patches list is installed
#' only if it is a dependency of another package. It is considered
#' compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as
#' `INSTALLED_OTHER`. This is the default action if no option is specified.
#' 
#' **Windows Server**: Windows Server doesn't support the concept of
#' package dependencies. If a package in the rejected patches list and
#' already installed on the node, its status is reported as
#' `INSTALLED_OTHER`. Any package not already installed on the node is
#' skipped. This is the default action if no option is specified.
#' 
#' **BLOCK**
#' 
#' **All OSs**: Packages in the rejected patches list, and packages that
#' include them as dependencies, aren't installed by Patch Manager under
#' any circumstances.
#' 
#' State value assignment for patch compliance:
#' 
#' -   If a package was installed before it was added to the rejected
#'     patches list, or is installed outside of Patch Manager afterward,
#'     it's considered noncompliant with the patch baseline and its status
#'     is reported as `INSTALLED_REJECTED`.
#' 
#' -   If an update attempts to install a dependency package that is now
#'     rejected by the baseline, when previous versions of the package were
#'     not rejected, the package being updated is reported as `MISSING` for
#'     `SCAN` operations and as `FAILED` for `INSTALL` operations.
#' @param Description A description of the patch baseline.
#' @param Sources Information about the patches to use to update the managed nodes,
#' including target operating systems and source repositories. Applies to
#' Linux managed nodes only.
#' @param AvailableSecurityUpdatesComplianceStatus Indicates the status to be assigned to security patches that are
#' available but not approved because they don't meet the installation
#' criteria specified in the patch baseline.
#' 
#' Example scenario: Security patches that you might want installed can be
#' skipped if you have specified a long period to wait after a patch is
#' released before installation. If an update to the patch is released
#' during your specified waiting period, the waiting period for installing
#' the patch starts over. If the waiting period is too long, multiple
#' versions of the patch could be released but never installed.
#' 
#' Supported for Windows Server managed nodes only.
#' @param Replace If True, then all fields that are required by the
#' [`create_patch_baseline`][ssm_create_patch_baseline] operation are also
#' required for this API request. Optional fields that aren't specified are
#' set to null.

#' Update a resource data sync
#'
#' @description
#' Update a resource data sync. After you create a resource data sync for a Region, you can't change the account options for that sync. For example, if you create a sync in the us-east-2 (Ohio) Region and you choose the `Include only the current account` option, you can't edit that sync later and choose the `Include all accounts from my Organizations configuration` option. Instead, you must delete the first resource data sync, and create a new one.

#' ServiceSetting is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services
#' service
#'
#' @description
#' `ServiceSetting` is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_update_service_setting/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ssm_update_service_setting/) for full documentation.
