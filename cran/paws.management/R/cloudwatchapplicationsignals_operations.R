#' @description
#' Creates a service level objective (SLO), which can help you ensure that your critical business operations are meeting customer expectations. Use SLOs to set and track specific target levels for the reliability and availability of your applications and services. SLOs use service level indicators (SLIs) to calculate whether the application is performing at the level that you want.

#' Updates an existing service level objective (SLO)

#' @description
#' Updates an existing service level objective (SLO). If you omit parameters, the previous values of those parameters are retained.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudwatchapplicationsignals_update_service_level_objective/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/cloudwatchapplicationsignals_update_service_level_objective/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Id &#91;required&#93; The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of the service level objective
#' that you want to update.
#' @param Description An optional description for the SLO.
#' @param SliConfig If this SLO is a period-based SLO, this structure defines the
#' information about what performance metric this SLO will monitor.
#' @param RequestBasedSliConfig If this SLO is a request-based SLO, this structure defines the
#' information about what performance metric this SLO will monitor.
#' 
#' You can't specify both `SliConfig` and `RequestBasedSliConfig` in the
#' same operation.
#' @param Goal A structure that contains the attributes that determine the goal of the
#' SLO. This includes the time period for evaluation and the attainment
#' threshold.
#' @param BurnRateConfigurations Use this array to create *burn rates* for this SLO. Each burn rate is a
#' metric that indicates how fast the service is consuming the error
#' budget, relative to the attainment goal of the SLO.
