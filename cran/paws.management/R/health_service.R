#' AWS Health APIs and Notifications
#'
#' @description
#' AWS Health
#' 
#' The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health
#' information that appears in the [AWS Personal Health
#' Dashboard](https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/). You can use the API
#' operations to get information about AWS Health events that affect your
#' AWS services and resources.
#' 
#' -   You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan from [AWS
#'     Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/) to use the AWS
#'     Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account that
#'     doesn't have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a
#'     `SubscriptionRequiredException` error.
#' 
#' -   You can use the AWS Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
#'     (HTTPS) to call the AWS Health API operations. AWS Health supports a
#'     multi-Region application architecture and has two regional endpoints
#'     in an active-passive configuration. You can use the high
#'     availability endpoint example to determine which AWS Region is
#'     active, so that you can get the latest information from the API. For
#'     more information, see [Accessing the AWS Health
#'     API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html)
#'     in the *AWS Health User Guide*.
#' 
#' For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the [Signature Version 4
#' Signing
#' Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
#' 
#' If your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS
#' Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized
#' view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You
#' can aggregate AWS Health events in real time to identify accounts in
#' your organization that are affected by an operational event or get
#' notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API
#' operations to enable this feature and return event information. For more
#' information, see [Aggregating AWS Health
#' events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html)
#' in the *AWS Health User Guide*.
#' 
#' When you use the AWS Health API operations to return AWS Health events,
#' see the following recommendations:
#' 
#' -   Use the
#'     [eventScopeCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode)
#'     parameter to specify whether to return AWS Health events that are
#'     public or account-specific.
#' 
#' -   Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if
#'     you call the
#'     [`describe_events_for_organization`][health_describe_events_for_organization]
#'     operation to get all events in your organization, you might receive
#'     several page results. Specify the `nextToken` in the next request to
#'     return more results.
#'
#' @param
#' config
#' Optional configuration of credentials, endpoint, and/or region.
#'
#' @section Service syntax:
