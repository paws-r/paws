\arguments{
\item{ServerlessCacheName}{[required] User-provided identifier for the serverless cache. This parameter is
stored as a lowercase string.}

\item{Description}{User-provided description for the serverless cache. The default is NULL,
i.e. if no description is provided then an empty string will be
returned. The maximum length is 255 characters.}

\item{Engine}{[required] The name of the cache engine to be used for creating the serverless
cache.}

\item{MajorEngineVersion}{The version of the cache engine that will be used to create the
serverless cache.}

\item{CacheUsageLimits}{Sets the cache usage limits for storage and ElastiCache Processing Units
for the cache.}

\item{KmsKeyId}{ARN of the customer managed key for encrypting the data at rest. If no
KMS key is provided, a default service key is used.}

\item{SecurityGroupIds}{A list of the one or more VPC security groups to be associated with the
serverless cache. The security group will authorize traffic access for
the VPC end-point (private-link). If no other information is given this
will be the VPCâ€™s Default Security Group that is associated with the
cluster VPC end-point.}

\item{SnapshotArnsToRestore}{The ARN(s) of the snapshot that the new serverless cache will be created
from. Available for Valkey, Redis OSS and Serverless Memcached only.}

\item{Tags}{The list of tags (key, value) pairs to be added to the serverless cache
resource. Default is NULL.}

\item{UserGroupId}{The identifier of the UserGroup to be associated with the serverless
cache. Available for Valkey and Redis OSS only. Default is NULL.}

\item{SubnetIds}{A list of the identifiers of the subnets where the VPC endpoint for the
serverless cache will be deployed. All the subnetIds must belong to the
same VPC.}

\item{SnapshotRetentionLimit}{The number of snapshots that will be retained for the serverless cache
that is being created. As new snapshots beyond this limit are added, the
oldest snapshots will be deleted on a rolling basis. Available for
Valkey, Redis OSS and Serverless Memcached only.}

\item{DailySnapshotTime}{The daily time that snapshots will be created from the new serverless
cache. By default this number is populated with 0, i.e. no snapshots
will be created on an automatic daily basis. Available for Valkey, Redis
OSS and Serverless Memcached only.}
