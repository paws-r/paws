\title{The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or
more tables}
\usage{
dynamodb_batch_write_item(
  RequestItems,
  ReturnConsumedCapacity = NULL,
  ReturnItemCollectionMetrics = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{RequestItems}{[required] A map of one or more table names and, for each table, a list of
operations to be performed (\code{DeleteRequest} or \code{PutRequest}). Each
element in the map consists of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{DeleteRequest} - Perform a \code{\link[=dynamodb_delete_item]{delete_item}}
operation on the specified item. The item to be deleted is
identified by a \code{Key} subelement:
\itemize{
\item \code{Key} - A map of primary key attribute values that uniquely
identify the item. Each entry in this map consists of an
attribute name and an attribute value. For each primary key, you
must provide \emph{all} of the key attributes. For example, with a
simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the
partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide
values for \emph{both} the partition key and the sort key.
}
\item \code{PutRequest} - Perform a \code{\link[=dynamodb_put_item]{put_item}} operation
on the specified item. The item to be put is identified by an \code{Item}
subelement:
\itemize{
\item \code{Item} - A map of attributes and their values. Each entry in
this map consists of an attribute name and an attribute value.
Attribute values must not be null; string and binary type
attributes must have lengths greater than zero; and set type
attributes must not be empty. Requests that contain empty values
are rejected with a \code{ValidationException} exception.

If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key,
then the data types for those attributes must match those of the
schema in the table's attribute definition.
}
}}

\item{ReturnConsumedCapacity}{}

\item{ReturnItemCollectionMetrics}{Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to
\code{SIZE}, the response includes statistics about item collections, if any,
that were modified during the operation are returned in the response. If
set to \code{NONE} (the default), no statistics are returned.}
}
\description{
The \code{\link[=dynamodb_batch_write_item]{batch_write_item}} operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to \code{\link[=dynamodb_batch_write_item]{batch_write_item}} can transmit up to 16MB of data over the network, consisting of up to 25 item put or delete operations. While individual items can be up to 400 KB once stored, it's important to note that an item's representation might be greater than 400KB while being sent in DynamoDB's JSON format for the API call. For more details on this distinction, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html}{Naming Rules and Data Types}.
