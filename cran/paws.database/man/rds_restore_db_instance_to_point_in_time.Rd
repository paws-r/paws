Constraints:
\itemize{
\item The value must be \code{1150-65535}.
}}

\item{AvailabilityZone}{The Availability Zone (AZ) where the DB instance will be created.

controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't
permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't
permit it.
