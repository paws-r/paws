\item{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is
automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets
Manager.

This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS
in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different
Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

If you don't specify \code{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}, then the
\code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the
secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use
the \code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use
a customer managed KMS key.
