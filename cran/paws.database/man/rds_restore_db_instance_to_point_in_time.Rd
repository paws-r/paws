Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens
\item First character must be a letter
\item Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

latest backup time.

Constraints: Can't be specified if the \code{RestoreTime} parameter is
provided.}

\item{DBInstanceClass}{The compute and memory capacity of the Amazon RDS DB instance, for
example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all
Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full
list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html}{DB Instance Class}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

Default: The same DBInstanceClass as the original DB instance.}

\item{Port}{The port number on which the database accepts connections.

Constraints: Value must be \code{1150-65535}

Constraint: You can't specify the \code{AvailabilityZone} parameter if the DB
instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS)
endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's
virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from
outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately
controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't
permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't
permit it.

When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.
