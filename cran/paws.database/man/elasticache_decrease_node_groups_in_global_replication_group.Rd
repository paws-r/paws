\title{Decreases the number of node groups in a Global datastore}
\usage{
elasticache_decrease_node_groups_in_global_replication_group(
  GlobalReplicationGroupId,
  NodeGroupCount,
  GlobalNodeGroupsToRemove = NULL,
  GlobalNodeGroupsToRetain = NULL,
  ApplyImmediately
)
}
\arguments{
\item{GlobalReplicationGroupId}{[required] The name of the Global datastore}

\item{NodeGroupCount}{[required] The number of node groups (shards) that results from the modification of
the shard configuration}

\item{GlobalNodeGroupsToRemove}{If the value of NodeGroupCount is less than the current number of node
groups (shards), then either NodeGroupsToRemove or NodeGroupsToRetain is
required. GlobalNodeGroupsToRemove is a list of NodeGroupIds to remove
from the cluster. ElastiCache will attempt to remove all node groups
listed by GlobalNodeGroupsToRemove from the cluster.}

\item{GlobalNodeGroupsToRetain}{If the value of NodeGroupCount is less than the current number of node
groups (shards), then either NodeGroupsToRemove or NodeGroupsToRetain is
required. GlobalNodeGroupsToRetain is a list of NodeGroupIds to retain
from the cluster. ElastiCache will attempt to retain all node groups
listed by GlobalNodeGroupsToRetain from the cluster.}

\item{ApplyImmediately}{[required] Indicates that the shard reconfiguration process begins immediately. At
present, the only permitted value for this parameter is true.}
