\arguments{
\item{DBInstanceIdentifier}{[required] The identifier of DB instance to modify. This value is stored as a
lowercase string.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must match the identifier of an existing DB instance.
}}

\item{AllocatedStorage}{The new amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to allocate for the DB
instance.

For RDS for Db2, MariaDB, RDS for MySQL, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for
PostgreSQL, the value supplied must be at least 10\% greater than the
current value. Values that are not at least 10\% greater than the
existing value are rounded up so that they are 10\% greater than the
current value.

For the valid values for allocated storage for each engine, see
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance]{create_db_instance}}.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item When you increase the allocated storage for a DB instance that uses
Provisioned IOPS (\code{gp3}, \code{io1}, or \code{io2} storage type), you must
also specify the \code{Iops} parameter. You can use the current value for
\code{Iops}.
}}

\item{DBInstanceClass}{The new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance, for example
\code{db.m4.large}. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon
Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list of
DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html}{DB Instance Class}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide} or \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html}{Aurora DB instance classes}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide}. For RDS Custom, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-reqs-limits.html#custom-reqs-limits.instances}{DB instance class support for RDS Custom for Oracle}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-reqs-limits-MS.html#custom-reqs-limits.instancesMS}{DB instance class support for RDS Custom for SQL Server}.

If you modify the DB instance class, an outage occurs during the change.
The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you
specify \code{ApplyImmediately} in your request.

Default: Uses existing setting

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item If you are modifying the DB instance class and upgrading the engine
version at the same time, the currently running engine version must
be supported on the specified DB instance class. Otherwise, the
operation returns an error. In this case, first run the operation to
upgrade the engine version, and then run it again to modify the DB
instance class.
}}

\item{DBSubnetGroupName}{The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this parameter
to move your DB instance to a different VPC. If your DB instance isn't
in a VPC, you can also use this parameter to move your DB instance into
a VPC. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#USER_VPC.Non-VPC2VPC}{Working with a DB instance in a VPC}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

Changing the subnet group causes an outage during the change. The change
is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you enable
\code{ApplyImmediately}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item If supplied, must match existing DB subnet group.
}

Example: \code{mydbsubnetgroup}}

\item{DBSecurityGroups}{A list of DB security groups to authorize on this DB instance. Changing
this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is
asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item If supplied, must match existing DB security groups.
}}

\item{VpcSecurityGroupIds}{A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB
instance. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:
\itemize{
\item Amazon Aurora (The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is
managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see
\code{\link[=rds_modify_db_cluster]{modify_db_cluster}}.)
\item RDS Custom
}

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item If supplied, must match existing VPC security group IDs.
}}

\item{ApplyImmediately}{Specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending
modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless
of the \code{PreferredMaintenanceWindow} setting for the DB instance. By
default, this parameter is disabled.

If this parameter is disabled, changes to the DB instance are applied
during the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes can cause an
outage and are applied on the next call to
\code{\link[=rds_reboot_db_instance]{reboot_db_instance}}, or the next failure
reboot. Review the table of parameters in \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html}{Modifying a DB Instance}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide} to see the impact of enabling or
disabling \code{ApplyImmediately} for each modified parameter and to
determine when the changes are applied.}

\item{MasterUserPassword}{The new password for the master user.

Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is
asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the
request and the completion of the request, the \code{MasterUserPassword}
element exists in the \code{PendingModifiedValues} element of the operation
response.

Amazon RDS API operations never return the password, so this operation
provides a way to regain access to a primary instance user if the
password is lost. This includes restoring privileges that might have
been accidentally revoked.

This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:
\itemize{
\item Amazon Aurora (The password for the master user is managed by the DB
cluster. For more information, see
\code{\link[=rds_modify_db_cluster]{modify_db_cluster}}.)
\item RDS Custom
}

Default: Uses existing setting

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Can't be specified if \code{ManageMasterUserPassword} is turned on.
\item Can include any printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".
For RDS for Oracle, can't include the "&" (ampersand) or the "'"
(single quotes) character.
}

Length Constraints:
\itemize{
\item RDS for Db2 - Must contain from 8 to 255 characters.
\item RDS for MariaDB - Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.
\item RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - Must contain from 8 to 128
characters.
\item RDS for MySQL - Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.
\item RDS for Oracle - Must contain from 8 to 30 characters.
\item RDS for PostgreSQL - Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.
}}

\item{DBParameterGroupName}{The name of the DB parameter group to apply to the DB instance.

Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage. The parameter group
name itself is changed immediately, but the actual parameter changes are
not applied until you reboot the instance without failover. In this
case, the DB instance isn't rebooted automatically, and the parameter
changes aren't applied during the next maintenance window. However, if
you modify dynamic parameters in the newly associated DB parameter
group, these changes are applied immediately without a reboot.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Default: Uses existing setting

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be in the same DB parameter group family as the DB instance.
}}

\item{BackupRetentionPeriod}{The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter
to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0
disables automated backups.

Enabling and disabling backups can result in a brief I/O suspension that
lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size and
class of your DB instance.

These changes are applied during the next maintenance window unless the
\code{ApplyImmediately} parameter is enabled for this request. If you change
the parameter from one non-zero value to another non-zero value, the
change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The retention
period for automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more
information, see \code{\link[=rds_modify_db_cluster]{modify_db_cluster}}.

Default: Uses existing setting

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be a value from 0 to 35.
\item Can't be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to read replicas.
\item Can't be set to 0 for an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance.
}}

\item{PreferredBackupWindow}{The daily time range during which automated backups are created if
automated backups are enabled, as determined by the
\code{BackupRetentionPeriod} parameter. Changing this parameter doesn't
result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as
possible. The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an
8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.BackupWindow}{Backup window}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The daily time
range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For
more information, see \code{\link[=rds_modify_db_cluster]{modify_db_cluster}}.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be in the format \code{hh24:mi-hh24:mi}.
\item Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
\item Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.
\item Must be at least 30 minutes.
}}

\item{PreferredMaintenanceWindow}{The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, which
might result in an outage. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an
outage, except in the following situation, and the change is
asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions
that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include
the current time, then changing this parameter causes a reboot of the DB
instance. If you change this window to the current time, there must be
at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to
ensure pending changes are applied.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#Concepts.DBMaintenance}{Amazon RDS Maintenance Window}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

Default: Uses existing setting

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be in the format \code{ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi}.
\item The day values must be \code{mon | tue | wed | thu | fri | sat | sun}.
\item Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
\item Must not conflict with the preferred backup window.
\item Must be at least 30 minutes.
}}

\item{MultiAZ}{Specifies whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing
this parameter doesn't result in an outage. The change is applied during
the next maintenance window unless the \code{ApplyImmediately} parameter is
enabled for this request.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{EngineVersion}{The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing this
parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during the next
maintenance window unless the \code{ApplyImmediately} parameter is enabled
for this request.

For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB parameter group is
currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group
family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB
parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family.

If you specify only a major version, Amazon RDS updates the DB instance
to the default minor version if the current minor version is lower. For
information about valid engine versions, see
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance]{create_db_instance}}, or call
\code{\link[=rds_describe_db_engine_versions]{describe_db_engine_versions}}.

If the instance that you're modifying is acting as a read replica, the
engine version that you specify must be the same or higher than the
version that the source DB instance or cluster is running.

In RDS Custom for Oracle, this parameter is supported for read replicas
only if they are in the \code{PATCH_DB_FAILURE} lifecycle.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item If you are upgrading the engine version and modifying the DB
instance class at the same time, the currently running engine
version must be supported on the specified DB instance class.
Otherwise, the operation returns an error. In this case, first run
the operation to upgrade the engine version, and then run it again
to modify the DB instance class.
}}

\item{AllowMajorVersionUpgrade}{Specifies whether major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this
parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously
applied as soon as possible.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Major version upgrades must be allowed when specifying a value for
the \code{EngineVersion} parameter that's a different major version than
the DB instance's current version.
}}

\item{AutoMinorVersionUpgrade}{Specifies whether minor version upgrades are applied automatically to
the DB instance during the maintenance window. An outage occurs when all
the following conditions are met:
\itemize{
\item The automatic upgrade is enabled for the maintenance window.
\item A newer minor version is available.
\item RDS has enabled automatic patching for the engine version.
}

If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, Amazon RDS applies the
change as soon as possible and doesn't cause an outage.

For an RDS Custom DB instance, don't enable this setting. Otherwise, the
operation returns an error.}

\item{LicenseModel}{The license model for the DB instance.

This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.

Valid Values:
\itemize{
\item RDS for Db2 - \code{bring-your-own-license}
\item RDS for MariaDB - \code{general-public-license}
\item RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - \code{license-included}
\item RDS for MySQL - \code{general-public-license}
\item RDS for Oracle - \code{bring-your-own-license | license-included}
\item RDS for PostgreSQL - \code{postgresql-license}
}}

\item{Iops}{The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS
instance.

Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is
applied during the next maintenance window unless the \code{ApplyImmediately}
parameter is enabled for this request. If you are migrating from
Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0. The DB
instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to take
effect.

If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to
Provisioned IOPS (io1), or from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage,
the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on
several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type
(standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and
the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times
are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some
cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but
might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes
place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon
RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the
instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read
replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item For RDS for MariaDB, RDS for MySQL, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for
PostgreSQL - The value supplied must be at least 10\% greater than
the current value. Values that are not at least 10\% greater than the
existing value are rounded up so that they are 10\% greater than the
current value.
\item When you increase the Provisioned IOPS, you must also specify the
\code{AllocatedStorage} parameter. You can use the current value for
\code{AllocatedStorage}.
}

Default: Uses existing setting}

\item{OptionGroupName}{The option group to associate the DB instance with.

Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, with one exception.
If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, it
can cause a brief period, lasting less than a second, during which new
connections are rejected but existing connections aren't interrupted.

The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the
\code{ApplyImmediately} parameter is enabled for this request.

Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security
TDE, can't be removed from an option group, and that option group can't
be removed from a DB instance after it is associated with a DB instance.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{NewDBInstanceIdentifier}{The new identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB instance. When
you change the DB instance identifier, an instance reboot occurs
immediately if you enable \code{ApplyImmediately}, or will occur during the
next maintenance window if you disable \code{ApplyImmediately}. This value is
stored as a lowercase string.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
\item The first character must be a letter.
\item Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
}

Example: \code{mydbinstance}}

\item{StorageType}{The storage type to associate with the DB instance.

If you specify \code{io1}, \code{io2}, or \code{gp3} you must also include a value for
the \code{Iops} parameter.

If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to
gp2 (General Purpose SSD), gp3, or Provisioned IOPS (io1), or from these
storage types to standard storage, the process can take time. The
duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database
load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount
of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage
operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process
can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB
instance is available for use, but might experience performance
degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the
instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place
for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the
instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the
instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

Valid Values: \code{gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard}

Default: \code{io1}, if the \code{Iops} parameter is specified. Otherwise, \code{gp2}.}

\item{TdeCredentialArn}{The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for TDE
encryption.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{TdeCredentialPassword}{The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access the
device.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{CACertificateIdentifier}{The CA certificate identifier to use for the DB instance's server
certificate.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html}{Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide} and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html}{Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide}.}

\item{Domain}{The Active Directory directory ID to move the DB instance to. Specify
\code{none} to remove the instance from its current domain. You must create
the domain before this operation. Currently, you can create only Db2,
MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances in an
Active Directory Domain.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/database-authentication.html}{Kerberos Authentication}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DomainFqdn}{The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an Active Directory domain.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Can't be longer than 64 characters.
}

Example: \code{mymanagedADtest.mymanagedAD.mydomain}}

\item{DomainOu}{The Active Directory organizational unit for your DB instance to join.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be in the distinguished name format.
\item Can't be longer than 64 characters.
}

Example:
\verb{OU=mymanagedADtestOU,DC=mymanagedADtest,DC=mymanagedAD,DC=mydomain}}

\item{DomainAuthSecretArn}{The ARN for the Secrets Manager secret with the credentials for the user
joining the domain.

Example:
\code{arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-number:secret:myselfmanagedADtestsecret-123456}}

\item{DomainDnsIps}{The IPv4 DNS IP addresses of your primary and secondary Active Directory
domain controllers.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Two IP addresses must be provided. If there isn't a secondary domain
controller, use the IP address of the primary domain controller for
both entries in the list.
}

Example: \verb{123.124.125.126,234.235.236.237}}

\item{CopyTagsToSnapshot}{Specifies whether to copy all tags from the DB instance to snapshots of
the DB instance. By default, tags aren't copied.

This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Copying tags
to snapshots is managed by the DB cluster. Setting this value for an
Aurora DB instance has no effect on the DB cluster setting. For more
information, see \code{\link[=rds_modify_db_cluster]{modify_db_cluster}}.}

\item{MonitoringInterval}{The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of
Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify \code{0}.

If \code{MonitoringRoleArn} is specified, set \code{MonitoringInterval} to a value
other than \code{0}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Valid Values: \code{0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60}

Default: \code{0}}

\item{DBPortNumber}{The port number on which the database accepts connections.

The value of the \code{DBPortNumber} parameter must not match any of the port
values specified for options in the option group for the DB instance.

If you change the \code{DBPortNumber} value, your database restarts
regardless of the value of the \code{ApplyImmediately} parameter.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Valid Values: \code{1150-65535}

Default:
\itemize{
\item Amazon Aurora - \code{3306}
\item RDS for Db2 - \code{50000}
\item RDS for MariaDB - \code{3306}
\item RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - \code{1433}
\item RDS for MySQL - \code{3306}

\code{3260}, \code{3343}, \code{3389}, \code{47001}, or \code{49152-49156}.
}}

\item{PubliclyAccessible}{Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from outside
of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System
(DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from
within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the
private IP address. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled
by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

\code{PubliclyAccessible} only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB
instance must be part of a public subnet and \code{PubliclyAccessible} must
be enabled for it to be publicly accessible.

Changes to the \code{PubliclyAccessible} parameter are applied immediately
regardless of the value of the \code{ApplyImmediately} parameter.}

\item{MonitoringRoleArn}{The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring
metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example,
\code{arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess}. For information on creating a
monitoring role, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole}{To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

If \code{MonitoringInterval} is set to a value other than \code{0}, supply a
\code{MonitoringRoleArn} value.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DomainIAMRoleName}{The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the Directory
Service.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DisableDomain}{Specifies whether to remove the DB instance from the Active Directory
domain.}

\item{PromotionTier}{The order of priority in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the
primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.AuroraHighAvailability.html#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance}{Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Default: \code{1}

Valid Values: \code{0 - 15}}

\item{EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication}{Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and
Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By default,
mapping isn't enabled.

This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora. Mapping Amazon Web Services
IAM accounts to database accounts is managed by the DB cluster.

For more information about IAM database authentication, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html}{IAM Database Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DatabaseInsightsMode}{Specifies the mode of Database Insights to enable for the DB instance.

This setting only applies to Amazon Aurora DB instances.

Currently, this value is inherited from the DB cluster and can't be
changed.}

\item{EnablePerformanceInsights}{Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the DB instance.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html}{Using Amazon Performance Insights}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance
Insights data.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

If you don't specify a value for \code{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}, then
Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a
different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod}{The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Valid Values:
\itemize{
\item \code{7}
\item \emph{month} * 31, where \emph{month} is a number of months from 1-23.
Examples: \code{93} (3 months * 31), \code{341} (11 months * 31), \code{589} (19
months * 31)
\item \code{731}
}

Default: \code{7} days

If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as \code{94}, Amazon
RDS returns an error.}

\item{CloudwatchLogsExportConfiguration}{The log types to be enabled for export to CloudWatch Logs for a specific
DB instance.

A change to the \code{CloudwatchLogsExportConfiguration} parameter is always
applied to the DB instance immediately. Therefore, the
\code{ApplyImmediately} parameter has no effect.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

The following values are valid for each DB engine:
\itemize{
\item Aurora MySQL - \code{audit | error | general | slowquery}
\item Aurora PostgreSQL - \code{postgresql}
\item RDS for MySQL - \code{error | general | slowquery}

\item{ProcessorFeatures}{The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB
instance class of the DB instance.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{UseDefaultProcessorFeatures}{Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its
default processor features.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DeletionProtection}{Specifies whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The
database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By
default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html}{Deleting a DB Instance}.

This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. You can enable
or disable deletion protection for the DB cluster. For more information,
see \code{\link[=rds_modify_db_cluster]{modify_db_cluster}}. DB instances in a DB
cluster can be deleted even when deletion protection is enabled for the
DB cluster.}

\item{MaxAllocatedStorage}{The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically
scale the storage of the DB instance.

For more information about this setting, including limitations that
apply to it, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling}{Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{CertificateRotationRestart}{Specifies whether the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your
SSL/TLS certificate.

By default, the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your SSL/TLS
certificate. The certificate is not updated until the DB instance is
restarted.

Set this parameter only if you are \emph{not} using SSL/TLS to connect to the
DB instance.

If you are using SSL/TLS to connect to the DB instance, follow the
appropriate instructions for your DB engine to rotate your SSL/TLS
certificate:
\itemize{
\item For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS
DB engines, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html}{Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate.}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}
\item For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for
Aurora DB engines, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html}{Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide}.
}

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{ReplicaMode}{A value that sets the open mode of a replica database to either mounted
or read-only.

Currently, this parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Enterprise Edition. The main
use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The
primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information
to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a
mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html}{Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{EnableCustomerOwnedIp}{Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) for an
RDS on Outposts DB instance.

A \emph{CoIP} provides local or external connectivity to resources in your
Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a
CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from
outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network.

For more information about RDS on Outposts, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html}{Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

For more information about CoIPs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/routing.html#ip-addressing}{Customer-owned IP addresses}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide}.}

\item{AwsBackupRecoveryPointArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point in Amazon Web
Services Backup.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{AutomationMode}{The automation mode of the RDS Custom DB instance. If \code{full}, the DB
instance automates monitoring and instance recovery. If \verb{all paused},
the instance pauses automation for the duration set by
\code{ResumeFullAutomationModeMinutes}.}

\item{ResumeFullAutomationModeMinutes}{The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time period
ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation.

Default: \code{60}

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be at least 60.
\item Must be no more than 1,440.
}}

\item{NetworkType}{The network type of the DB instance.

The network type is determined by the \code{DBSubnetGroup} specified for the
DB instance. A \code{DBSubnetGroup} can support only the IPv4 protocol or the
IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (\code{DUAL}).

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html}{Working with a DB instance in a VPC}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

Valid Values: \code{IPV4 | DUAL}}

\item{StorageThroughput}{The storage throughput value for the DB instance.

This setting applies only to the \code{gp3} storage type.

This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{ManageMasterUserPassword}{Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web
Services Secrets Manager.

If the DB instance doesn't manage the master user password with Amazon
Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn on this management. In this
case, you can't specify \code{MasterUserPassword}.

If the DB instance already manages the master user password with Amazon
Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify that the master user
password is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, then
you must specify \code{MasterUserPassword}. In this case, Amazon RDS deletes
the secret and uses the new password for the master user specified by
\code{MasterUserPassword}.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html}{Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services
Secrets Manager if \code{MasterUserPassword} is specified.
}}

\item{RotateMasterUserPassword}{Specifies whether to rotate the secret managed by Amazon Web Services
Secrets Manager for the master user password.

This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS
in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB cluster. The secret
value contains the updated password.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html}{Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item You must apply the change immediately when rotating the master user
password.
}}

\item{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is
automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets
Manager.

This setting is valid only if both of the following conditions are met:
\itemize{
\item The DB instance doesn't manage the master user password in Amazon
Web Services Secrets Manager.

If the DB instance already manages the master user password in
Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can't change the KMS key
used to encrypt the secret.
\item You are turning on \code{ManageMasterUserPassword} to manage the master
user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

If you are turning on \code{ManageMasterUserPassword} and don't specify
\code{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}, then the \code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key is
used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon
Web Services account, then you can't use the \code{aws/secretsmanager}
KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed
KMS key.
}

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different
Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your
Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each
Amazon Web Services Region.}

\item{Engine}{The target Oracle DB engine when you convert a non-CDB to a CDB. This
intermediate step is necessary to upgrade an Oracle Database 19c non-CDB
to an Oracle Database 21c CDB.

Note the following requirements:
\itemize{
\item Make sure that you specify \code{oracle-ee-cdb} or \code{oracle-se2-cdb}.
\item Make sure that your DB engine runs Oracle Database 19c with an April
2021 or later RU.
}

Note the following limitations:
\itemize{
\item You can't convert a CDB to a non-CDB.
\item You can't convert a replica database.
\item You can't convert a non-CDB to a CDB and upgrade the engine version
in the same command.
\item You can't convert the existing custom parameter or option group when
it has options or parameters that are permanent or persistent. In
this situation, the DB instance reverts to the default option and
parameter group. To avoid reverting to the default, specify a new
parameter group with \code{--db-parameter-group-name} and a new option
group with \code{--option-group-name}.
}}

\item{DedicatedLogVolume}{Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume (DLV)
enabled.}

\item{MultiTenant}{Specifies whether the to convert your DB instance from the single-tenant
configuration to the multi-tenant configuration. This parameter is
supported only for RDS for Oracle CDB instances.

During the conversion, RDS creates an initial tenant database and
associates the DB name, master user name, character set, and national
character set metadata with this database. The tags associated with the
instance also propagate to the initial tenant database. You can add more
tenant databases to your DB instance by using the
\code{\link[=rds_create_tenant_database]{create_tenant_database}} operation.

The conversion to the multi-tenant configuration is permanent and
irreversible, so you can't later convert back to the single-tenant
configuration. When you specify this parameter, you must also specify
\code{ApplyImmediately}.}
}
