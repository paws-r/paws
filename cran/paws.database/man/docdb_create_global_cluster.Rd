global cluster. This parameter is optional.}

\item{Engine}{The name of the database engine to be used for this cluster.}

\description{
Creates an Amazon DocumentDB global cluster that can span multiple multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. The global cluster contains one primary cluster with read-write capability, and up-to give read-only secondary clusters. Global clusters uses storage-based fast replication across regions with latencies less than one second, using dedicated infrastructure with no impact to your workloadâ€™s performance.
