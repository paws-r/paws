\arguments{
\item{DBInstanceIdentifier}{[required] Name of the DB instance to create from the DB snapshot. This parameter
isn't case-sensitive.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must contain from 1 to 63 numbers, letters, or hyphens
\item First character must be a letter
\item Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens
}

Example: \code{my-snapshot-id}}

\item{DBSnapshotIdentifier}{[required] The identifier for the DB snapshot to restore from.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must match the identifier of an existing DBSnapshot.
\item If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the
\code{DBSnapshotIdentifier} must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.
}}

\item{DBInstanceClass}{The compute and memory capacity of the Amazon RDS DB instance, for
example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all
Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full
list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html}{DB Instance Class}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

Default: The same DBInstanceClass as the original DB instance.}

\item{Port}{The port number on which the database accepts connections.

Default: The same port as the original DB instance

Constraints: Value must be \code{1150-65535}}

\item{AvailabilityZone}{The Availability Zone (AZ) where the DB instance will be created.

Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone.

Constraint: You can't specify the \code{AvailabilityZone} parameter if the DB
instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

Example: \verb{us-east-1a}}

\item{DBSubnetGroupName}{The DB subnet group name to use for the new instance.

Constraints: If supplied, must match the name of an existing
DBSubnetGroup.

Example: \code{mydbsubnetgroup}}

\item{MultiAZ}{A value that indicates whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

Constraint: You can't specify the \code{AvailabilityZone} parameter if the DB
instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.}

\item{PubliclyAccessible}{A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
(DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance
is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public
access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB
instance doesn't permit it.

When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

For more information, see
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance]{create_db_instance}}.}

\item{AutoMinorVersionUpgrade}{A value that indicates whether minor version upgrades are applied
automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window.

If you restore an RDS Custom DB instance, you must disable this
parameter.}

\item{LicenseModel}{License model information for the restored DB instance.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

Default: Same as source.

Valid values: \code{license-included} | \code{bring-your-own-license} |
\code{general-public-license}}

\item{DBName}{The database name for the restored DB instance.

This parameter doesn't apply to the MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB
engines. It also doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{Engine}{The database engine to use for the new instance.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

Default: The same as source

Constraint: Must be compatible with the engine of the source. For
example, you can restore a MariaDB 10.1 DB instance from a MySQL 5.6
snapshot.

Valid Values:
\itemize{
\item \code{mariadb}
\item \code{mysql}
\item \code{oracle-ee}

\item \code{oracle-se2-cdb}
\item \code{postgres}
\item \code{sqlserver-ee}
\item \code{sqlserver-se}
\item \code{sqlserver-ex}
\item \code{sqlserver-web}
}}

\item{Iops}{Specifies the amount of provisioned IOPS for the DB instance, expressed
in I/O operations per second. If this parameter isn't specified, the
IOPS value is taken from the backup. If this parameter is set to 0, the
new instance is converted to a non-PIOPS instance. The conversion takes
additional time, though your DB instance is available for connections
before the conversion starts.

The provisioned IOPS value must follow the requirements for your
database engine. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS}{Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS Storage to Improve Performance}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

Constraints: Must be an integer greater than 1000.}

\item{OptionGroupName}{The name of the option group to be used for the restored DB instance.

Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security
TDE, can't be removed from an option group, and that option group can't
be removed from a DB instance after it is associated with a DB instance.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{Tags}{}

\item{StorageType}{Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance.

Valid values: \code{standard | gp2 | io1}

If you specify \code{io1}, you must also include a value for the \code{Iops}
parameter.

Default: \code{io1} if the \code{Iops} parameter is specified, otherwise \code{gp2}}

\item{TdeCredentialArn}{The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for TDE
encryption.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{TdeCredentialPassword}{The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access the
device.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{VpcSecurityGroupIds}{A list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB instance.

Default: The default EC2 VPC security group for the DB subnet group's
VPC.}

\item{Domain}{Specify the Active Directory directory ID to restore the DB instance in.
The domain/ must be created prior to this operation. Currently, you can
create only MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB
instances in an Active Directory Domain.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/database-authentication.html}{Kerberos Authentication}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{CopyTagsToSnapshot}{A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the restored DB
instance to snapshots of the DB instance.

In most cases, tags aren't copied by default. However, when you restore
a DB instance from a DB snapshot, RDS checks whether you specify new
tags. If yes, the new tags are added to the restored DB instance. If
there are no new tags, RDS looks for the tags from the source DB
instance for the DB snapshot, and then adds those tags to the restored
DB instance.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html#USER_Tagging.CopyTags}{Copying tags to DB instance snapshots}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.}

\item{DomainIAMRoleName}{Specify the name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls to the
Directory Service.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication}{A value that indicates whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services
Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By
default, mapping is disabled.

For more information about IAM database authentication, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html}{IAM Database Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{EnableCloudwatchLogsExports}{The list of logs that the restored DB instance is to export to
CloudWatch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being
used. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html#USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch}{Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{ProcessorFeatures}{The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB
instance class of the DB instance.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{UseDefaultProcessorFeatures}{A value that indicates whether the DB instance class of the DB instance
uses its default processor features.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{DBParameterGroupName}{The name of the DB parameter group to associate with this DB instance.

If you don't specify a value for \code{DBParameterGroupName}, then RDS uses
the default \code{DBParameterGroup} for the specified DB engine.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBParameterGroup.
\item Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
\item First character must be a letter.
\item Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

\item{DeletionProtection}{A value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion protection
enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is
enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html}{Deleting a DB Instance}.}

\item{EnableCustomerOwnedIp}{A value that indicates whether to enable a customer-owned IP address
(CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

A \emph{CoIP} provides local or external connectivity to resources in your
Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a
CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from
outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

For more information about RDS on Outposts, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html}{Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

For more information about CoIPs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/#ip-addressing}{Customer-owned IP addresses}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide}.}

\item{CustomIamInstanceProfile}{The instance profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 instance
of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must meet the
following requirements:
\itemize{
\item The profile must exist in your account.
\item The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions to
assume.
\item The instance profile name and the associated IAM role name must
start with the prefix \code{AWSRDSCustom}.

This setting is required for RDS Custom.}

\item{BackupTarget}{Specifies where automated backups and manual snapshots are stored for
the restored DB instance.

Possible values are \code{outposts} (Amazon Web Services Outposts) and
\code{region} (Amazon Web Services Region). The default is \code{region}.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html}{Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.}

\item{NetworkType}{The network type of the DB instance.

Valid values:
\itemize{
\item \code{IPV4}
\item \code{DUAL}
}

The network type is determined by the \code{DBSubnetGroup} specified for the
DB instance. A \code{DBSubnetGroup} can support only the IPv4 protocol or the
IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (\code{DUAL}).

\description{
Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with most of the source's original configuration, including the default security group and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this case, the instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment.
