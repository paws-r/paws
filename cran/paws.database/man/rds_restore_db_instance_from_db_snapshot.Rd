\arguments{
\item{DBInstanceIdentifier}{[required] The name of the DB instance to create from the DB snapshot. This
parameter isn't case-sensitive.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must contain from 1 to 63 numbers, letters, or hyphens.
\item First character must be a letter.
\item Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
}

Example: \code{my-snapshot-id}}

\item{DBSnapshotIdentifier}{The identifier for the DB snapshot to restore from.

specified.
\item If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the
\code{DBSnapshotIdentifier} must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.
}}

\item{DBInstanceClass}{The compute and memory capacity of the Amazon RDS DB instance, for
example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all
Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full
list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html}{DB Instance Class}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

Default: The same DBInstanceClass as the original DB instance.}

\item{Port}{The port number on which the database accepts connections.

Default: The same port as the original DB instance

Constraints: Value must be \code{1150-65535}}

\item{AvailabilityZone}{The Availability Zone (AZ) where the DB instance will be created.

Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone.

Constraint: You can't specify the \code{AvailabilityZone} parameter if the DB
instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

Example: \verb{us-east-1a}}

\item{DBSubnetGroupName}{The name of the DB subnet group to use for the new instance.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item If supplied, must match the name of an existing DB subnet group.
}

Example: \code{mydbsubnetgroup}}

\item{MultiAZ}{Specifies whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

Constraint: You can't specify the \code{AvailabilityZone} parameter if the DB
instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.}

\item{PubliclyAccessible}{Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
(DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance
is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public
access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB
instance doesn't permit it.

When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

For more information, see
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance]{create_db_instance}}.}

\item{AutoMinorVersionUpgrade}{Specifies whether to automatically apply minor version upgrades to the
DB instance during the maintenance window.

If you restore an RDS Custom DB instance, you must disable this
parameter.}

\item{LicenseModel}{License model information for the restored DB instance.

License models for RDS for Db2 require additional configuration. The
Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model requires a custom parameter group
and an Amazon Web Services License Manager self-managed license. The Db2
license through Amazon Web Services Marketplace model requires an Amazon
Web Services Marketplace subscription. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html}{Amazon RDS for Db2 licensing options}

\item \code{sqlserver-web}
}}

\item{Iops}{Specifies the amount of provisioned IOPS for the DB instance, expressed
in I/O operations per second. If this parameter isn't specified, the
IOPS value is taken from the backup. If this parameter is set to 0, the
new instance is converted to a non-PIOPS instance. The conversion takes
additional time, though your DB instance is available for connections
before the conversion starts.

The provisioned IOPS value must follow the requirements for your
database engine. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS}{Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS storage}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

Constraints: Must be an integer greater than 1000.}

\item{OptionGroupName}{The name of the option group to be used for the restored DB instance.

\item{CopyTagsToSnapshot}{Specifies whether to copy all tags from the restored DB instance to
snapshots of the DB instance.

In most cases, tags aren't copied by default. However, when you restore
a DB instance from a DB snapshot, RDS checks whether you specify new
tags. If yes, the new tags are added to the restored DB instance. If
there are no new tags, RDS looks for the tags from the source DB
instance for the DB snapshot, and then adds those tags to the restored
DB instance.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html#USER_Tagging.CopyTags}{Copying tags to DB instance snapshots}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.}

\item{DomainIAMRoleName}{The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the Directory
Service.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication}{Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and
Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By default,
mapping is disabled.

For more information about IAM database authentication, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html}{IAM Database Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.}

\item{EnableCloudwatchLogsExports}{The list of logs for the restored DB instance to export to CloudWatch
Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html#USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch}{Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

\item{NetworkType}{The network type of the DB instance.

Valid Values:
\itemize{
\item \code{IPV4}
\item \code{DUAL}
}

The network type is determined by the \code{DBSubnetGroup} specified for the
DB instance. A \code{DBSubnetGroup} can support only the IPv4 protocol or the
IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (\code{DUAL}).

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html}{Working with a DB instance in a VPC}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}}

\item{StorageThroughput}{Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.}

in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide}.}

\item{EngineLifecycleSupport}{The life cycle type for this DB instance.

By default, this value is set to \code{open-source-rds-extended-support},
which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the
end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by
setting the value to \code{open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled}. In
this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB instance to a
higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of
standard support date.

You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS
Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected
major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard
support for that engine version. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/extended-support.html}{Using Amazon RDS Extended Support}

This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL. For
Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB
cluster.

Valid Values:
\code{open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled}

Default: \code{open-source-rds-extended-support}}
}
\description{
Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with most of the source's original configuration, including the default security group and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this case, the instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment.
