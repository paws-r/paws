\description{
Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series
database service that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of
time series data points per day. With Timestream, you can easily store
and analyze IoT sensor data to derive insights from your IoT
applications. You can analyze industrial telemetry to streamline
equipment management and maintenance. You can also store and analyze log
data and metrics to improve the performance and availability of your
applications. Timestream is built from the ground up to effectively
ingest, process, and store time series data. It organizes data to
optimize query processing. It automatically scales based on the volume
of data ingested and on the query volume to ensure you receive optimal
performance while inserting and querying data. As your data grows over
time, Timestreamâ€™s adaptive query processing engine spans across storage
tiers to provide fast analysis while reducing costs.
