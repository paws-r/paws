\arguments{
\item{DBInstanceIdentifier}{[required] The DB instance identifier of the read replica. This identifier is the
unique key that identifies a DB instance. This parameter is stored as a
lowercase string.}

\item{SourceDBInstanceIdentifier}{The identifier of the DB instance that will act as the source for the
read replica. Each DB instance can have up to 15 read replicas, with the
exception of Oracle and SQL Server, which can have up to five.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be the identifier of an existing Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle,
PostgreSQL, or SQL Server DB instance.
\item Can't be specified if the \code{SourceDBClusterIdentifier} parameter is
also specified.
\item For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.limitations.html#oracle-read-replicas.limitations.versions-and-licenses}{Version and licensing considerations for RDS for Oracle replicas}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.
\item For the limitations of SQL Server read replicas, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.ReadReplicas.html#SQLServer.ReadReplicas.Limitations}{Read replica limitations with SQL Server}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.
\item The specified DB instance must have automatic backups enabled, that
is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.
\item If the source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Region
as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier.
\item If the source DB instance is in a different Amazon Web Services
Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.ARN.html#USER_Tagging.ARN.Constructing}{Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}. This doesn't apply to SQL Server or
RDS Custom, which don't support cross-Region replicas.
}}

\item{DBInstanceClass}{The compute and memory capacity of the read replica, for example
db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon Web
Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list of DB
instance classes, and availability for your engine, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html}{DB Instance Class}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.}

\item{AvailabilityZone}{The Availability Zone (AZ) where the read replica will be created.

Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's
Amazon Web Services Region.

Example: \verb{us-east-1d}}

\item{Port}{The port number that the DB instance uses for connections.

Valid Values: \code{1150-65535}

Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.}

\item{MultiAZ}{Specifies whether the read replica is in a Multi-AZ deployment.

You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates a
standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for failover
support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB
instance is independent of whether the source is a Multi-AZ DB instance
or a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{AutoMinorVersionUpgrade}{Specifies whether to automatically apply minor engine upgrades to the
read replica during the maintenance window.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.}

\item{Iops}{The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to
initially allocate for the DB instance.}

\item{OptionGroupName}{The option group to associate the DB instance with. If not specified,
RDS uses the option group associated with the source DB instance or
cluster.

For SQL Server, you must use the option group associated with the
source.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DBParameterGroupName}{The name of the DB parameter group to associate with this read replica
DB instance.

For Single-AZ or Multi-AZ DB instance read replica instances, if you
don't specify a value for \code{DBParameterGroupName}, then Amazon RDS uses
the \code{DBParameterGroup} of the source DB instance for a same Region read
replica, or the default \code{DBParameterGroup} for the specified DB engine
for a cross-Region read replica.

For Multi-AZ DB cluster same Region read replica instances, if you don't
specify a value for \code{DBParameterGroupName}, then Amazon RDS uses the
default \code{DBParameterGroup}.

Specifying a parameter group for this operation is only supported for
MySQL DB instances for cross-Region read replicas, for Multi-AZ DB
cluster read replica instances, and for Oracle DB instances. It isn't
supported for MySQL DB instances for same Region read replicas or for
RDS Custom.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
\item First character must be a letter.
\item Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
}}

\item{PubliclyAccessible}{Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS)
endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's
virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from
outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately
controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't
permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't
permit it.

When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

For more information, see
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance]{create_db_instance}}.}

\item{Tags}{}

\item{DBSubnetGroupName}{A DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance is created in
the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If no DB subnet group is
specified, then the new DB instance isn't created in a VPC.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item If supplied, must match the name of an existing DB subnet group.
\item The specified DB subnet group must be in the same Amazon Web
Services Region in which the operation is running.
\item All read replicas in one Amazon Web Services Region that are created
from the same source DB instance must either:
\itemize{
\item Specify DB subnet groups from the same VPC. All these read
replicas are created in the same VPC.
\item Not specify a DB subnet group. All these read replicas are
created outside of any VPC.
}
}

Example: \code{mydbsubnetgroup}}

\item{VpcSecurityGroupIds}{A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with the read
replica.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Default: The default EC2 VPC security group for the DB subnet group's
VPC.}

\item{StorageType}{The storage type to associate with the read replica.

If you specify \code{io1}, \code{io2}, or \code{gp3}, you must also include a value for
the \code{Iops} parameter.

Valid Values: \code{gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard}

Default: \code{io1} if the \code{Iops} parameter is specified. Otherwise, \code{gp2}.}

\item{CopyTagsToSnapshot}{Specifies whether to copy all tags from the read replica to snapshots of
the read replica. By default, tags aren't copied.}

\item{MonitoringInterval}{The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collection of
Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify \code{0}. The default is \code{0}.

If \code{MonitoringRoleArn} is specified, then you must set
\code{MonitoringInterval} to a value other than \code{0}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Valid Values: \verb{0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60}

Default: \code{0}}

\item{MonitoringRoleArn}{The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring
metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example,
\code{arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess}. For information on creating a
monitoring role, go to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole}{To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

If \code{MonitoringInterval} is set to a value other than 0, then you must
supply a \code{MonitoringRoleArn} value.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{KmsKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted read
replica.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services
Region as the source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, don't specify a
value for this parameter. A read replica in the same Amazon Web Services
Region is always encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB
instance or cluster.

If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web
Services Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the
destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the
Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use
KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web
Services Region.

You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB
instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses the same KMS key as
the primary replica.}

\item{PreSignedUrl}{When you are creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services
GovCloud (US) Region to another or from one China Amazon Web Services
Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed
request for the
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance_read_replica]{create_db_instance_read_replica}}
API operation in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the
source DB instance.

This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions
and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web
Services Regions.

This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB \emph{instance}.
Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions.

You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read
replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS
API. Don't specify \code{PreSignedUrl} when you are creating an encrypted
read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

The presigned URL must be a valid request for the
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance_read_replica]{create_db_instance_read_replica}}
API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that
contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request
must contain the following parameter values:
\itemize{
\item \code{DestinationRegion} - The Amazon Web Services Region that the
encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services
Region is the same one where the
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance_read_replica]{create_db_instance_read_replica}}
operation is called that contains this presigned URL.

For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1
Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the
us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance_read_replica]{create_db_instance_read_replica}}
operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a
presigned URL that contains a call to the
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance_read_replica]{create_db_instance_read_replica}}
operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this
example, the \code{DestinationRegion} in the presigned URL must be set to
the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.
\item \code{KmsKeyId} - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt
the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This
is the same identifier for both the
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance_read_replica]{create_db_instance_read_replica}}
operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services
Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.
\item \code{SourceDBInstanceIdentifier} - The DB instance identifier for the
encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in
the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web
Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read
replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services
Region, then your \code{SourceDBInstanceIdentifier} looks like the
following example:
\code{arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115}.
}

To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html}{Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html}{Signature Version 4 Signing Process}.

If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
specify \code{SourceRegion} (or \code{--source-region} for the CLI) instead of
specifying \code{PreSignedUrl} manually. Specifying \code{SourceRegion}
autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation
that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication}{Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and
Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By default,
mapping isn't enabled.

For more information about IAM database authentication, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html}{IAM Database Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DatabaseInsightsMode}{The mode of Database Insights to enable for the read replica.

Currently, this setting is not supported.}

\item{EnablePerformanceInsights}{Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the read replica.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html}{Using Amazon Performance Insights}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance
Insights data.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

If you do not specify a value for \code{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}, then
Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a
different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod}{The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

Valid Values:
\itemize{
\item \code{7}
\item \emph{month} * 31, where \emph{month} is a number of months from 1-23.
Examples: \code{93} (3 months * 31), \code{341} (11 months * 31), \code{589} (19
months * 31)
\item \code{731}
}

Default: \code{7} days

If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as \code{94}, Amazon
RDS returns an error.}

\item{EnableCloudwatchLogsExports}{The list of logs that the new DB instance is to export to CloudWatch
Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html#USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch}{Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{ProcessorFeatures}{The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB
instance class of the DB instance.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{UseDefaultProcessorFeatures}{Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its
default processor features.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DeletionProtection}{Specifies whether to enable deletion protection for the DB instance. The
database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By
default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html}{Deleting a DB Instance}.}

\item{Domain}{The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in.
Currently, only MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB
instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/database-authentication.html}{Kerberos Authentication}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DomainIAMRoleName}{The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the Directory
Service.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{DomainFqdn}{The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an Active Directory domain.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Can't be longer than 64 characters.
}

Example: \code{mymanagedADtest.mymanagedAD.mydomain}}

\item{DomainOu}{The Active Directory organizational unit for your DB instance to join.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be in the distinguished name format.
\item Can't be longer than 64 characters.
}

Example:
\verb{OU=mymanagedADtestOU,DC=mymanagedADtest,DC=mymanagedAD,DC=mydomain}}

\item{DomainAuthSecretArn}{The ARN for the Secrets Manager secret with the credentials for the user
joining the domain.

Example:
\code{arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-number:secret:myselfmanagedADtestsecret-123456}}

\item{DomainDnsIps}{The IPv4 DNS IP addresses of your primary and secondary Active Directory
domain controllers.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Two IP addresses must be provided. If there isn't a secondary domain
controller, use the IP address of the primary domain controller for
both entries in the list.
}

Example: \verb{123.124.125.126,234.235.236.237}}

\item{ReplicaMode}{The open mode of the replica database: mounted or read-only.

This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition.
The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster
recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit
information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user
connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload.

You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for
the same primary DB instance. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html}{Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to \code{mounted}.
The value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can
manage the open mode manually.}

\item{MaxAllocatedStorage}{The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically
scale the storage of the DB instance.

For more information about this setting, including limitations that
apply to it, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling}{Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.}

\item{CustomIamInstanceProfile}{The instance profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 instance
of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must meet the
following requirements:
\itemize{
\item The profile must exist in your account.
\item The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions to
assume.
\item The instance profile name and the associated IAM role name must
start with the prefix \code{AWSRDSCustom}.
}

For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-setup-orcl.html#custom-setup-orcl.iam-vpc}{Configure IAM and your VPC}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting is required for RDS Custom DB instances.}

\item{NetworkType}{The network type of the DB instance.

Valid Values:
\itemize{
\item \code{IPV4}
\item \code{DUAL}
}

The network type is determined by the \code{DBSubnetGroup} specified for read
replica. A \code{DBSubnetGroup} can support only the IPv4 protocol or the
IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (\code{DUAL}).

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html}{Working with a DB instance in a VPC}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}}

\item{StorageThroughput}{Specifies the storage throughput value for the read replica.

This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora DB instances.}

\item{EnableCustomerOwnedIp}{Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) for an
RDS on Outposts read replica.

A \emph{CoIP} provides local or external connectivity to resources in your
Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a
CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the read replica from
outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network.

For more information about RDS on Outposts, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html}{Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

For more information about CoIPs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/routing.html#ip-addressing}{Customer-owned IP addresses}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide}.}

\item{AllocatedStorage}{The amount of storage (in gibibytes) to allocate initially for the read
replica. Follow the allocation rules specified in
\code{\link[=rds_create_db_instance]{create_db_instance}}.

This setting isn't valid for RDS for SQL Server.

Be sure to allocate enough storage for your read replica so that the
create operation can succeed. You can also allocate additional storage
for future growth.}

\item{SourceDBClusterIdentifier}{The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB cluster that will act as the source
for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read replicas.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be the identifier of an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster.
