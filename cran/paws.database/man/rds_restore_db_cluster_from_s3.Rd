more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/database-authentication.html}{Kerberos Authentication}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide}.}

\item{DomainIAMRoleName}{Specify the name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls to the

Secrets Manager if \code{MasterUserPassword} is specified.
}}

\item{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is
automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets
Manager.

This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS
in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB cluster.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different
Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

If you don't specify \code{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}, then the
\code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the
secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use
the \code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use
a customer managed KMS key.

There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your
Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each
Amazon Web Services Region.}

Valid Values: \code{aurora}, \code{aurora-iopt1}

Default: \code{aurora}

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{EngineLifecycleSupport}{The life cycle type for this DB cluster.

By default, this value is set to \code{open-source-rds-extended-support},
which enrolls your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the
end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by
setting the value to \code{open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled}. In
this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB cluster to a
higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of
standard support date.

You can use this setting to enroll your DB cluster into Amazon RDS
Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected
major engine version on your DB cluster past the end of standard support
for that engine version. For more information, see the following
