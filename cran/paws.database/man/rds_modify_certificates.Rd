\title{Override the system-default Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer
Security (SSL/TLS) certificate for Amazon RDS for new DB instances, or
remove the override}
\usage{
rds_modify_certificates(CertificateIdentifier, RemoveCustomerOverride)
}
\arguments{
\item{CertificateIdentifier}{The new default certificate identifier to override the current one with.

To determine the valid values, use the \code{describe-certificates} AWS CLI
command or the \code{DescribeCertificates} API operation.}

\item{RemoveCustomerOverride}{A value that indicates whether to remove the override for the default
certificate. If the override is removed, the default certificate is the
system default.}
}
\description{
Override the system-default Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer
Security (SSL/TLS) certificate for Amazon RDS for new DB instances, or
remove the override.
}
\details{
By using this operation, you can specify an RDS-approved SSL/TLS
certificate for new DB instances that is different from the default
certificate provided by RDS. You can also use this operation to remove
the override, so that new DB instances use the default certificate
provided by RDS.

You might need to override the default certificate in the following
situations:
\itemize{
\item You already migrated your applications to support the latest
certificate authority (CA) certificate, but the new CA certificate
is not yet the RDS default CA certificate for the specified AWS
Region.
\item RDS has already moved to a new default CA certificate for the
specified AWS Region, but you are still in the process of supporting
the new CA certificate. In this case, you temporarily need
additional time to finish your application changes.
}
