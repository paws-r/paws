\description{
Used to failover a shard. This API is designed for testing the behavior of your application in case of MemoryDB failover. It is not designed to be used as a production-level tool for initiating a failover to overcome a problem you may have with the cluster. Moreover, in certain conditions such as large scale operational events, Amazon may block this API.
