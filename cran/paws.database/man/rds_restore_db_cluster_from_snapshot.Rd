\item{PubliclyAccessible}{A value that indicates whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS)
endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's
virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from
outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately
controlled by the security group it uses. That public access is not
permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't
permit it.

When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether
\code{DBSubnetGroupName} is specified.

If \code{DBSubnetGroupName} isn't specified, and \code{PubliclyAccessible} isn't
specified, the following applies:
\itemize{
\item If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet
gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
\item If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway
attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
}

If \code{DBSubnetGroupName} is specified, and \code{PubliclyAccessible} isn't
specified, the following applies:
\itemize{
\item If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet
gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
\item If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway
attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
}

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters}

\item{ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration}{}
