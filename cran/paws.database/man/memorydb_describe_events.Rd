\arguments{
\item{SourceName}{The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If not
specified, all sources are included in the response.}

\item{SourceType}{The event source to retrieve events for. If no value is specified, all
events are returned.}

\item{StartTime}{The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified in
ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z}

\item{EndTime}{The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified in
ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z}

\item{Duration}{The number of minutes worth of events to retrieve.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more
records exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included
in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.}

\item{NextToken}{An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records exceeds
the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are more
results available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagination token
for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve

\description{
Returns events related to clusters, security groups, and parameter groups. You can obtain events specific to a particular cluster, security group, or parameter group by providing the name as a parameter. By default, only the events occurring within the last hour are returned; however, you can retrieve up to 14 days' worth of events if necessary.
