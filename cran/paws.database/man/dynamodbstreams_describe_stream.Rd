\title{Returns information about a stream, including the current status of the
stream, its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the composition of its shards,
and its corresponding DynamoDB table}
\usage{
dynamodbstreams_describe_stream(StreamArn, Limit, ExclusiveStartShardId)
}
\arguments{
\item{StreamArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the stream.}

\item{Limit}{The maximum number of shard objects to return. The upper limit is 100.}

\item{ExclusiveStartShardId}{The shard ID of the first item that this operation will evaluate. Use
the value that was returned for \code{LastEvaluatedShardId} in the previous
operation.}
}

and its corresponding DynamoDB table.

\details{
You can call \code{DescribeStream} at a maximum rate of 10 times per second.

Each shard in the stream has a \code{SequenceNumberRange} associated with it.
If the \code{SequenceNumberRange} has a \code{StartingSequenceNumber} but no
\code{EndingSequenceNumber}, then the shard is still open (able to receive
more stream records). If both \code{StartingSequenceNumber} and
\code{EndingSequenceNumber} are present, then that shard is closed and can no
longer receive more data.
