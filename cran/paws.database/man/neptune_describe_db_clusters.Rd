\title{Returns information about provisioned DB clusters, and supports
pagination}
\usage{
neptune_describe_db_clusters(
  DBClusterIdentifier = NULL,
  Filters = NULL,
  MaxRecords = NULL,
  Marker = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DBClusterIdentifier}{The user-supplied DB cluster identifier. If this parameter is specified,
information from only the specific DB cluster is returned. This
parameter isn't case-sensitive.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item If supplied, must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier.
}}

\item{Filters}{A filter that specifies one or more DB clusters to describe.

Supported filters:
\itemize{
\item \code{db-cluster-id} - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster
Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list will only include
information about the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.
\item \code{engine} - Accepts an engine name (such as \code{neptune}), and restricts
the results list to DB clusters created by that engine.
}

For example, to invoke this API from the Amazon CLI and filter so that
only Neptune DB clusters are returned, you could use the following
command:}

\item{MaxRecords}{The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more
records exist than the specified \code{MaxRecords} value, a pagination token
called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining
results can be retrieved.

Default: 100

Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.}

\item{Marker}{An optional pagination token provided by a previous
\code{\link[=neptune_describe_db_clusters]{describe_db_clusters}} request. If this
parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the
marker, up to the value specified by \code{MaxRecords}.}
}
\description{
Returns information about provisioned DB clusters, and supports pagination.
