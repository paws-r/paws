When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
(DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance
is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public
access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB
instance doesn't permit it.

When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

\item{StorageEncrypted}{Specifies whether the new DB instance is encrypted or not.}

\item{KmsKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB instance.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different
Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

If the \code{StorageEncrypted} parameter is enabled, and you do not specify a
value for the \code{KmsKeyId} parameter, then Amazon RDS will use your
default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services
account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS
key for each Amazon Web Services Region.}

\item{CopyTagsToSnapshot}{Specifies whether to copy all tags from the DB instance to snapshots of
the DB instance. By default, tags are not copied.}

\item{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance
Insights data.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

If you do not specify a value for \code{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}, then
Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a

\item{NetworkType}{The network type of the DB instance.

Valid Values:
\itemize{
\item \code{IPV4}
\item \code{DUAL}
}

The network type is determined by the \code{DBSubnetGroup} specified for the
DB instance. A \code{DBSubnetGroup} can support only the IPv4 protocol or the
IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (\code{DUAL}).

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html}{Working with a DB instance in a VPC}

automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets
Manager.

This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS
in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different
Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

If you don't specify \code{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}, then the
\code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the
secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use
the \code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use
a customer managed KMS key.

There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your
Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each

\item{EngineLifecycleSupport}{The life cycle type for this DB instance.

By default, this value is set to \code{open-source-rds-extended-support},
which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the
end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by
setting the value to \code{open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled}. In
this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB instance to a
higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of
standard support date.

You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS
Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected
major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard
support for that engine version. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/extended-support.html}{Using Amazon RDS Extended Support}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL. For
Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB
cluster.

Valid Values:
\code{open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled}

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) supports importing MySQL databases by using backup files. You can create a backup of your on-premises database, store it on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and then restore the backup file onto a new Amazon RDS DB instance running MySQL.
