\arguments{
\item{DBInstanceIdentifier}{[required] The instance identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
\item The first character must be a letter.
\item Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

Example: \code{mydbinstance}}

\item{DBInstanceClass}{[required] The compute and memory capacity of the instance; for example,
\code{db.r5.large}.}

\item{Engine}{[required] The name of the database engine to be used for this instance.

Valid value: \code{docdb}}

\item{AvailabilityZone}{The Amazon EC2 Availability Zone that the instance is created in.

Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's
Amazon Web Services Region.

Example: \verb{us-east-1d}}

\item{PreferredMaintenanceWindow}{The time range each week during which system maintenance can occur, in
Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

Format: \code{ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi}

The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a random
day of the week.

Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.}

\item{AutoMinorVersionUpgrade}{This parameter does not apply to Amazon DocumentDB. Amazon DocumentDB
does not perform minor version upgrades regardless of the value set.

Default: \code{false}}

\item{Tags}{The tags to be assigned to the instance. You can assign up to 10 tags to
an instance.}

\item{DBClusterIdentifier}{[required] The identifier of the cluster that the instance will belong to.}

\item{CopyTagsToSnapshot}{A value that indicates whether to copy tags from the DB instance to
snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags are not copied.}

\item{PromotionTier}{A value that specifies the order in which an Amazon DocumentDB replica
is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing
primary instance.

Default: 1

Valid values: 0-15}

\item{EnablePerformanceInsights}{A value that indicates whether to enable Performance Insights for the DB
Instance. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/performance-insights.html}{Using Amazon Performance Insights}.}

\item{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}{The KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.

The KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name
for the KMS key.

If you do not specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId, then
Amazon DocumentDB uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key
for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account
has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services region.}
