When you apply a parameter group using the
\code{DBInstanceParameterGroupName} parameter, the DB cluster isn't rebooted
automatically. Also, parameter changes are applied immediately rather
than during the next maintenance window.

Default: The existing name setting

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter group family
as this DB cluster.
\item The \code{DBInstanceParameterGroupName} parameter is valid in combination
with the \code{AllowMajorVersionUpgrade} parameter for a major version

\item{EnableHttpEndpoint}{Specifies whether to enable the HTTP endpoint for an Aurora Serverless
v1 DB cluster. By default, the HTTP endpoint isn't enabled.

When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web service
API (RDS Data API) for running SQL queries on the Aurora Serverless v1
DB cluster. You can also query your database from inside the RDS console
with the RDS query editor.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html}{Using RDS Data API}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide}.

This parameter applies only to Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters. To
enable or disable the HTTP endpoint for an Aurora Serverless v2 or
provisioned DB cluster, use the
\code{\link[=rds_enable_http_endpoint]{enable_http_endpoint}} and
\code{\link[=rds_disable_http_endpoint]{disable_http_endpoint}} operations.

to the primary cluster of a global cluster (Aurora global database). By
default, write operations are not allowed on Aurora DB clusters that are
secondary clusters in an Aurora global database.

You can set this value only on Aurora DB clusters that are members of an
Aurora global database. With this parameter enabled, a secondary cluster
can forward writes to the current primary cluster, and the resulting
changes are replicated back to this cluster. For the primary DB cluster
of an Aurora global database, this value is used immediately if the
primary is demoted by a global cluster API operation, but it does
nothing until then.

Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{DBClusterInstanceClass}{The compute and memory capacity of each DB instance in the Multi-AZ DB
cluster, for example \code{db.m6gd.xlarge}. Not all DB instance classes are

Default: \code{0}}

\item{MonitoringRoleArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that permits RDS to send
Enhanced Monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. An example is

Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters}

\item{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance
Insights data.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

If you don't specify a value for \code{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}, then
Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a
different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as \code{94}, Amazon
RDS issues an error.}

\item{ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration}{}

\item{NetworkType}{The network type of the DB cluster.

The network type is determined by the \code{DBSubnetGroup} specified for the
DB cluster. A \code{DBSubnetGroup} can support only the IPv4 protocol or the
IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (\code{DUAL}).

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html}{Working with a DB instance in a VPC}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide.}

\item{ManageMasterUserPassword}{Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web
Services Secrets Manager.

If the DB cluster doesn't manage the master user password with Amazon
Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn on this management. In this
case, you can't specify \code{MasterUserPassword}.

If the DB cluster already manages the master user password with Amazon
Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify that the master user
password is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, then
you must specify \code{MasterUserPassword}. In this case, RDS deletes the
secret and uses the new password for the master user specified by
\code{MasterUserPassword}.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html}{Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager}

in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide.}

Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item You must apply the change immediately when rotating the master user
password.
}}

\item{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is
automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets
Manager.

This setting is valid only if both of the following conditions are met:
\itemize{
\item The DB cluster doesn't manage the master user password in Amazon Web
Services Secrets Manager.

If the DB cluster already manages the master user password in Amazon
Web Services Secrets Manager, you can't change the KMS key that is
used to encrypt the secret.
\item You are turning on \code{ManageMasterUserPassword} to manage the master
user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

If you are turning on \code{ManageMasterUserPassword} and don't specify
\code{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}, then the \code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key is
used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon
Web Services account, then you can't use the \code{aws/secretsmanager}
KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed
KMS key.
}

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different
