isn't case-sensitive.

Constraints: This identifier must match the identifier of an existing DB
cluster.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters}

\item{NewDBClusterIdentifier}{The new DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster when renaming a DB
cluster. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

Constraints:
\itemize{

applied during the next maintenance window.

The \code{ApplyImmediately} parameter only affects the
\code{EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication}, \code{MasterUserPassword}, and
\code{NewDBClusterIdentifier} values. If the \code{ApplyImmediately} parameter is

immediately, regardless of the value of the \code{ApplyImmediately}
parameter.

DB clusters are associated with a default option group that can't be
modified.}

\item{PreferredBackupWindow}{The daily time range during which automated backups are created if
automated backups are enabled, using the \code{BackupRetentionPeriod}

value for the \code{EngineVersion} parameter that is a different major
version than the DB cluster's current version.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{DBInstanceParameterGroupName}{The name of the DB parameter group to apply to all instances of the DB
cluster.

When you apply a parameter group using the
\code{DBInstanceParameterGroupName} parameter, the DB cluster isn't rebooted
automatically. Also, parameter changes are applied immediately rather
than during the next maintenance window.

Default: The existing name setting

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter group family
as this DB cluster.
\item The \code{DBInstanceParameterGroupName} parameter is valid in combination
with the \code{AllowMajorVersionUpgrade} parameter for a major version
upgrade only.
}

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{Domain}{The Active Directory directory ID to move the DB cluster to. Specify
\code{none} to remove the cluster from its current domain. The domain must be
created prior to this operation.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/database-authentication.html}{Kerberos Authentication}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide}.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{DomainIAMRoleName}{Specify the name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls to the
Directory Service.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{ScalingConfiguration}{The scaling properties of the DB cluster. You can only modify scaling
properties for DB clusters in \code{serverless} DB engine mode.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{DeletionProtection}{A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has deletion protection
enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is
enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters}

\item{EnableHttpEndpoint}{A value that indicates whether to enable the HTTP endpoint for an Aurora
Serverless v1 DB cluster. By default, the HTTP endpoint is disabled.

When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web service
API for running SQL queries on the Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. You
can also query your database from inside the RDS console with the query
editor.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html}{Using the Data API for Aurora Serverless v1}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide}.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{CopyTagsToSnapshot}{A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the DB cluster to
snapshots of the DB cluster. The default is not to copy them.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters}

\item{EnableGlobalWriteForwarding}{A value that indicates whether to enable this DB cluster to forward
write operations to the primary cluster of an Aurora global database
(GlobalCluster). By default, write operations are not allowed on Aurora
DB clusters that are secondary clusters in an Aurora global database.

You can set this value only on Aurora DB clusters that are members of an
Aurora global database. With this parameter enabled, a secondary cluster
can forward writes to the current primary cluster and the resulting
changes are replicated back to this cluster. For the primary DB cluster
of an Aurora global database, this value is used immediately if the
primary is demoted by the
\code{\link[=rds_failover_global_cluster]{failover_global_cluster}} API operation,
but it does nothing until then.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{DBClusterInstanceClass}{The compute and memory capacity of each DB instance in the Multi-AZ DB
cluster, for example db.m6g.xlarge. Not all DB instance classes are
available in all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database
engines.

For the full list of DB instance classes and availability for your
engine, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html}{DB Instance Class}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{AllocatedStorage}{The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to allocate to each DB instance
in the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

Type: Integer

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{StorageType}{Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB cluster.

Valid values: \code{io1}

When specified, a value for the \code{Iops} parameter is required.

Default: \code{io1}

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{Iops}{The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to
be initially allocated for each DB instance in the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

For information about valid Iops values, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS}{Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS Storage to Improve Performance}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

Constraints: Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount
for the DB cluster.

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{AutoMinorVersionUpgrade}{A value that indicates whether minor engine upgrades are applied
automatically to the DB cluster during the maintenance window. By
default, minor engine upgrades are applied automatically.

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{MonitoringInterval}{The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
metrics are collected for the DB cluster. To turn off collecting
Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

If \code{MonitoringRoleArn} is specified, also set \code{MonitoringInterval} to a
value other than 0.

Valid Values: \verb{0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60}

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{MonitoringRoleArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that permits RDS to send
Enhanced Monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. An example is
\code{arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess}. For information on creating a
monitoring role, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole}{To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}

If \code{MonitoringInterval} is set to a value other than 0, supply a
\code{MonitoringRoleArn} value.

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{EnablePerformanceInsights}{A value that indicates whether to turn on Performance Insights for the
DB cluster.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html}{Using Amazon Performance Insights}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance
Insights data.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

If you don't specify a value for \code{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}, then
Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a
different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod}{The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. The default is 7
days. The following values are valid:
\itemize{
\item 7
\item \emph{month} * 31, where \emph{month} is a number of months from 1-23
\item 731
}

For example, the following values are valid:
\itemize{
\item 93 (3 months * 31)
\item 341 (11 months * 31)
\item 589 (19 months * 31)
\item 731
}

If you specify a retention period such as 94, which isn't a valid value,
RDS issues an error.

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration}{}
