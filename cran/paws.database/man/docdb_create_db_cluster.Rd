\arguments{
\item{AvailabilityZones}{A list of Amazon EC2 Availability Zones that instances in the cluster
can be created in.}

\item{BackupRetentionPeriod}{The number of days for which automated backups are retained. You must
specify a minimum value of 1.

Default: 1

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be a value from 1 to 35.
}}

\item{DBClusterIdentifier}{[required] The cluster identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
\item The first character must be a letter.
\item Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
}

Example: \code{my-cluster}}

\item{DBClusterParameterGroupName}{The name of the cluster parameter group to associate with this cluster.}

\item{VpcSecurityGroupIds}{A list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this cluster.}

\item{DBSubnetGroupName}{A subnet group to associate with this cluster.

Constraints: Must match the name of an existing \code{DBSubnetGroup}. Must
not be default.

Example: \code{mySubnetgroup}}

\item{Engine}{[required] The name of the database engine to be used for this cluster.

Valid values: \code{docdb}}

\item{EngineVersion}{The version number of the database engine to use. The \code{--engine-version}
will default to the latest major engine version. For production
workloads, we recommend explicitly declaring this parameter with the
intended major engine version.}

\item{Port}{The port number on which the instances in the cluster accept
connections.}

\item{MasterUsername}{The name of the master user for the cluster.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be from 1 to 63 letters or numbers.
\item The first character must be a letter.
\item Cannot be a reserved word for the chosen database engine.
}}

\item{MasterUserPassword}{The password for the master database user. This password can contain any
printable ASCII character except forward slash (/), double quote ("), or
the "at" symbol (@).

Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 100 characters.}

\item{PreferredBackupWindow}{The daily time range during which automated backups are created if
automated backups are enabled using the \code{BackupRetentionPeriod}
parameter.

The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be in the format \code{hh24:mi-hh24:mi}.
\item Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
\item Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.
\item Must be at least 30 minutes.
}}

\item{PreferredMaintenanceWindow}{The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in
Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

Format: \code{ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi}

The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a random
day of the week.

Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.}

\item{Tags}{The tags to be assigned to the cluster.}

\item{StorageEncrypted}{Specifies whether the cluster is encrypted.}

\item{KmsKeyId}{The KMS key identifier for an encrypted cluster.

The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
encryption key. If you are creating a cluster using the same Amazon Web
Services account that owns the KMS encryption key that is used to
encrypt the new cluster, you can use the KMS key alias instead of the
ARN for the KMS encryption key.

If an encryption key is not specified in \code{KmsKeyId}:
\itemize{
\item If the \code{StorageEncrypted} parameter is \code{true}, Amazon DocumentDB
uses your default encryption key.
}

KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services
account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default
encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Regions.}

\item{PreSignedUrl}{Not currently supported.}

\item{EnableCloudwatchLogsExports}{A list of log types that need to be enabled for exporting to Amazon
CloudWatch Logs. You can enable audit logs or profiler logs. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/event-auditing.html}{Auditing Amazon DocumentDB Events}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/profiling.html}{Profiling Amazon DocumentDB Operations}.}

\item{DeletionProtection}{Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted. If \code{DeletionProtection}
is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is modified and
\code{DeletionProtection} is disabled. \code{DeletionProtection} protects clusters
from being accidentally deleted.}

\item{GlobalClusterIdentifier}{The cluster identifier of the new global cluster.}

\item{StorageType}{The storage type to associate with the DB cluster.

For information on storage types for Amazon DocumentDB clusters, see
Cluster storage configurations in the \emph{Amazon DocumentDB Developer
Guide}.

Valid values for storage type - \code{standard | iopt1}

Default value is \code{standard }

When you create a DocumentDB DB cluster with the storage type set to
\code{iopt1}, the storage type is returned in the response. The storage type
isn't returned when you set it to \code{standard}.}

\item{ManageMasterUserPassword}{Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web
Services Secrets Manager.

Constraint: You can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web
Services Secrets Manager if \code{MasterUserPassword} is specified.}

\item{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is
automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets
Manager. This setting is valid only if the master user password is
managed by Amazon DocumentDB in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for
the DB cluster.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different
Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

If you don't specify \code{MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId}, then the
\code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the
secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use
the \code{aws/secretsmanager} KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use
a customer managed KMS key.

There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your
Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each
Amazon Web Services Region.}
