provision the cluster. For example, if you have several EC2 instances
running in a specific Availability Zone, then you might want the cluster
to be provisioned in the same zone in order to decrease network latency.

disabled, you can still create manual snapshots when you want with
\code{\link[=redshift_create_cluster_snapshot]{create_cluster_snapshot}}.

You can't disable automated snapshots for RA3 node types. Set the
automated retention period from 1-35 days.

Default: \code{1}

Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35.}

\item{ManualSnapshotRetentionPeriod}{The default number of days to retain a manual snapshot. If the value is
-1, the snapshot is retained indefinitely. This setting doesn't change
the retention period of existing snapshots.

The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.}

\item{Port}{The port number on which the cluster accepts incoming connections.

The cluster is accessible only via the JDBC and ODBC connection strings.
Part of the connection string requires the port on which the cluster
will listen for incoming connections.

\item For clusters with ra3 nodes - Select a port within the ranges
\code{5431-5455} or \code{8191-8215}. (If you have an existing cluster with

\item{AllowVersionUpgrade}{If \code{true}, major version upgrades can be applied during the maintenance
window to the Amazon Redshift engine that is running on the cluster.

can request that the service automatically apply upgrades during the
maintenance window to the Amazon Redshift engine that is running on your
cluster.

Default: \code{true}}

\item{NumberOfNodes}{The number of compute nodes in the cluster. This parameter is required
when the \strong{ClusterType} parameter is specified as \code{multi-node}.

For information about determining how many nodes you need, go to
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#how-many-nodes}{Working with Clusters}
in the \emph{Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide}.

If you don't specify this parameter, you get a single-node cluster. When
requesting a multi-node cluster, you must specify the number of nodes
that you want in the cluster.

Default: \code{1}

Constraints: Value must be at least 1 and no more than 100.}

\item{PubliclyAccessible}{If \code{true}, the cluster can be accessed from a public network.

Default: false}

information the Amazon Redshift cluster can use to retrieve and store
keys in an HSM.}

\item{ElasticIp}{The Elastic IP (EIP) address for the cluster.

Constraints: The cluster must be provisioned in EC2-VPC and
publicly-accessible through an Internet gateway. Don't specify the
Elastic IP address for a publicly accessible cluster with availability
zone relocation turned on. For more information about provisioning
clusters in EC2-VPC, go to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#cluster-platforms}{Supported Platforms to Launch Your Cluster}

\item{KmsKeyId}{The Key Management Service (KMS) key ID of the encryption key that you
want to use to encrypt data in the cluster.}

\item{EnhancedVpcRouting}{An option that specifies whether to create the cluster with enhanced VPC
routing enabled. To create a cluster that uses enhanced VPC routing, the
cluster must be in a VPC. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/enhanced-vpc-routing.html}{Enhanced VPC Routing}
in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

If this option is \code{true}, enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

Default: false}

\item{AvailabilityZoneRelocation}{The option to enable relocation for an Amazon Redshift cluster between
Availability Zones after the cluster is created.}

\item{AquaConfigurationStatus}{This parameter is retired. It does not set the AQUA configuration
status. Amazon Redshift automatically determines whether to use AQUA
(Advanced Query Accelerator).}

\item{DefaultIamRoleArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that was set as default
for the cluster when the cluster was created.}

\item{LoadSampleData}{A flag that specifies whether to load sample data once the cluster is
created.}

\item{ManageMasterPassword}{If \code{true}, Amazon Redshift uses Secrets Manager to manage this cluster's
admin credentials. You can't use \code{MasterUserPassword} if
\code{ManageMasterPassword} is true. If \code{ManageMasterPassword} is false or
not set, Amazon Redshift uses \code{MasterUserPassword} for the admin user
account's password.}
