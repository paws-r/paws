disabled, you can still create manual snapshots when you want with
CreateClusterSnapshot.

Default: \code{1}

Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35.}

\item{ManualSnapshotRetentionPeriod}{The default number of days to retain a manual snapshot. If the value is
-1, the snapshot is retained indefinitely. This setting doesn\'t change
the retention period of existing snapshots.

The value must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653.}

\item{Port}{The port number on which the cluster accepts incoming connections.

The cluster is accessible only via the JDBC and ODBC connection strings.

\item{Tags}{A list of tag instances.}

\item{KmsKeyId}{The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key ID of the encryption key that
you want to use to encrypt data in the cluster.}

\item{EnhancedVpcRouting}{An option that specifies whether to create the cluster with enhanced VPC
routing enabled. To create a cluster that uses enhanced VPC routing, the
cluster must be in a VPC. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/enhanced-vpc-routing.html}{Enhanced VPC Routing}
in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

If this option is \code{true}, enhanced VPC routing is enabled.

Default: false}

\item{AdditionalInfo}{Reserved.}

\item{IamRoles}{A list of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that can be
used by the cluster to access other AWS services. You must supply the
IAM roles in their Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format. You can supply up
to 10 IAM roles in a single request.

A cluster can have up to 10 IAM roles associated with it at any time.}

cluster. If you don\'t provide a maintenance track name, the cluster is
assigned to the \code{current} track.}

\description{
Creates a new cluster.

\details{
To create a cluster in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you must provide a
cluster subnet group name. The cluster subnet group identifies the
subnets of your VPC that Amazon Redshift uses when creating the cluster.
