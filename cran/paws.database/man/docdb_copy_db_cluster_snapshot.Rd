\usage{
docdb_copy_db_cluster_snapshot(
  SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier,
  TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier,
  KmsKeyId = NULL,
  PreSignedUrl = NULL,
  CopyTags = NULL,
  Tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier}{[required] The identifier of the cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is not
case sensitive.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must specify a valid system snapshot in the \emph{available} state.
\item If the source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as
the copy, specify a valid snapshot identifier.
\item If the source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services Region
than the copy, specify a valid cluster snapshot ARN.
}

Example: \code{my-cluster-snapshot1}}

\item{TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier}{[required] The identifier of the new cluster snapshot to create from the source
cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case sensitive.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
\item The first character must be a letter.
\item Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
}

Example: \code{my-cluster-snapshot2}}

\item{KmsKeyId}{The KMS key ID for an encrypted cluster snapshot. The KMS key ID is the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for
the KMS encryption key.

If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web Services
account, you can specify a value for \code{KmsKeyId} to encrypt the copy with
a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for \code{KmsKeyId},
then the copy of the cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key
as the source cluster snapshot.

If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot that is shared from another
Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify a value for
\code{KmsKeyId}.

To copy an encrypted cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Services
Region, set \code{KmsKeyId} to the KMS key ID that you want to use to encrypt
the copy of the cluster snapshot in the destination Region. KMS
encryption keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they
are created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one Amazon Web
Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region.

If you copy an unencrypted cluster snapshot and specify a value for the
\code{KmsKeyId} parameter, an error is returned.}

\item{PreSignedUrl}{The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for
the\code{\link[=docdb_copy_db_cluster_snapshot]{copy_db_cluster_snapshot}} API
action in the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source
cluster snapshot to copy. You must use the \code{PreSignedUrl} parameter when
copying a cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region.

If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
specify \code{SourceRegion} (or \code{--source-region} for the CLI) instead of
specifying \code{PreSignedUrl} manually. Specifying \code{SourceRegion}
autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation
that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

The presigned URL must be a valid request for the
\code{\link[=docdb_copy_db_cluster_snapshot]{copy_db_cluster_snapshot}} API action
that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that
contains the cluster snapshot to be copied. The presigned URL request
must contain the following parameter values:
\itemize{
\item \code{SourceRegion} - The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to
be copied.
\item \code{SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier} - The identifier for the the
encrypted cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in
the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web
Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted
cluster snapshot from the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, then
your \code{SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier} looks something like the
following:
\code{arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:12345678012:sample-cluster:sample-cluster-snapshot}.
\item \code{TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier} - The identifier for the new
cluster snapshot to be created. This parameter isn't case sensitive.
}}

\item{CopyTags}{Set to \code{true} to copy all tags from the source cluster snapshot to the
target cluster snapshot, and otherwise \code{false}. The default is \code{false}.}

\item{Tags}{The tags to be assigned to the cluster snapshot.}
