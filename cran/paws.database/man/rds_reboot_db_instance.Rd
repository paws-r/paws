You might need to reboot your DB instance, usually for maintenance
reasons. For example, if you make certain modifications, or if you
change the DB parameter group associated with the DB instance, you must
reboot the instance for the changes to take effect.
}
\details{
Rebooting a DB instance restarts the database engine service. Rebooting
a DB instance results in a momentary outage, during which the DB
instance status is set to rebooting.

For more information about rebooting, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RebootInstance.html}{Rebooting a DB Instance}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide.}
