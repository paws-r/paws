\description{
Creates an event notification subscription. This action requires a topic ARN (Amazon Resource Name) created by either the Neptune console, the SNS console, or the SNS API. To obtain an ARN with SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS console.
