\usage{
dynamodb_describe_limits()
}
\description{
Returns the current provisioned-capacity limits for your AWS account in
a Region, both for the Region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table
that you create there.
}
\details{
When you establish an AWS account, the account has initial limits on the
maximum read capacity units and write capacity units that you can
provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given Region. Also,
there are per-table limits that apply when you create a table there. For
more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html}{Limits}
page in the \emph{Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide}.

Although you can increase these limits by filing a case at \href{https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/}{AWS Support Center}, obtaining the
increase is not instantaneous. The \code{DescribeLimits} action lets you
write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those
limits imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for
an increase before you hit a limit.

For example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to do the following:
\enumerate{
\item Call \code{DescribeLimits} for a particular Region to obtain your current
account limits on provisioned capacity there.
\item Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units
provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the
aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.
\item Call \code{ListTables} to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.
\item For each table name listed by \code{ListTables}, do the following:
\itemize{
\item Call \code{DescribeTable} with the table name.
\item Use the data returned by \code{DescribeTable} to add the read
capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the
table itself to your variables.
\item If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs),
loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values
to your variables as well.
}
\item Report the account limits for that Region returned by
\code{DescribeLimits}, along with the total current provisioned capacity
levels you have calculated.
}

This will let you see whether you are getting close to your
account-level limits.

The per-table limits apply only when you are creating a new table. They
restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and
all its global secondary indexes.

For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn\'t let you increase
provisioned capacity extremely rapidly. But the only upper limit that
applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables
and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account limits.

\code{DescribeLimits} should only be called periodically. You can expect
throttling errors if you call it more than once in a minute.

The \code{DescribeLimits} Request element has no content.
