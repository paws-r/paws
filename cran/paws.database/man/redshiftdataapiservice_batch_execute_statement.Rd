\arguments{
\item{ClientToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request.}

\item{ClusterIdentifier}{The cluster identifier. This parameter is required when connecting to a
cluster and authenticating using either Secrets Manager or temporary
credentials.}

\item{Database}{The name of the database. This parameter is required when authenticating
using either Secrets Manager or temporary credentials.}

\item{DbUser}{The database user name. This parameter is required when connecting to a
cluster as a database user and authenticating using temporary
credentials.}

\item{ResultFormat}{The data format of the result of the SQL statement. If no format is
specified, the default is JSON.}

\item{SecretArn}{The name or ARN of the secret that enables access to the database. This
parameter is required when authenticating using Secrets Manager.}

\item{SessionId}{The session identifier of the query.}

\item{SessionKeepAliveSeconds}{The number of seconds to keep the session alive after the query
finishes. The maximum time a session can keep alive is 24 hours. After
24 hours, the session is forced closed and the query is terminated.}

\item{Sqls}{[required] One or more SQL statements to run.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ The SQL statements are run as a single transaction. They run serially in the order of the array. Subsequent SQL statements don\\'t start until the previous statement in the array completes. If any SQL statement fails, then because they are run as one transaction, all work is rolled back.</p>
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}}

\item{StatementName}{The name of the SQL statements. You can name the SQL statements when you
create them to identify the query.}

\item{WithEvent}{A value that indicates whether to send an event to the Amazon
EventBridge event bus after the SQL statements run.}

\item{WorkgroupName}{The serverless workgroup name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This
parameter is required when connecting to a serverless workgroup and
