Default: \code{aurora} (Aurora DB clusters); \code{io1} (Multi-AZ DB clusters)

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters}

\item{PubliclyAccessible}{Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS)
endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's
virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from
outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately
controlled by the security group it uses. That public access is not
permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't
permit it.

When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether
\code{DBSubnetGroupName} is specified.

If \code{DBSubnetGroupName} isn't specified, and \code{PubliclyAccessible} isn't
specified, the following applies:
\itemize{
\item If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet
gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
\item If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway
attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
}

If \code{DBSubnetGroupName} is specified, and \code{PubliclyAccessible} isn't
specified, the following applies:
\itemize{
\item If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet
gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
\item If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway
attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
}

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{Iops}{The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to
be initially allocated for each DB instance in the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

For information about valid IOPS values, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS}{Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS storage}
in the \emph{Amazon RDS User Guide}.

Constraints: Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount
for the DB instance.

Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only}

\item{ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration}{}

\item{NetworkType}{The network type of the DB cluster.

Valid Values:
\itemize{
\item \code{IPV4}
\item \code{DUAL}
}

The network type is determined by the \code{DBSubnetGroup} specified for the
DB cluster. A \code{DBSubnetGroup} can support only the IPv4 protocol or the
IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (\code{DUAL}).

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html}{Working with a DB instance in a VPC}
in the \emph{Amazon Aurora User Guide.}

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only}

\item{RdsCustomClusterConfiguration}{Reserved for future use.}

\item{MonitoringInterval}{The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
metrics are collected for the DB cluster. To turn off collecting
Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify \code{0}.

If \code{MonitoringRoleArn} is specified, also set \code{MonitoringInterval} to a
value other than \code{0}.

Valid Values: \code{0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60}

Default: \code{0}}

\item{MonitoringRoleArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that permits RDS to send
Enhanced Monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. An example is
\code{arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess}.

If \code{MonitoringInterval} is set to a value other than \code{0}, supply a
\code{MonitoringRoleArn} value.}

\item{EnablePerformanceInsights}{Specifies whether to turn on Performance Insights for the DB cluster.}

\item{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}{The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance
Insights data.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias
ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

If you don't specify a value for \code{PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId}, then
Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a
different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.}

\item{PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod}{The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

Valid Values:
\itemize{
\item \code{7}
\item \emph{month} * 31, where \emph{month} is a number of months from 1-23.
Examples: \code{93} (3 months * 31), \code{341} (11 months * 31), \code{589} (19
months * 31)
\item \code{731}
}

Default: \code{7} days

If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as \code{94}, Amazon
RDS issues an error.}

\item{EngineLifecycleSupport}{The life cycle type for this DB cluster.

By default, this value is set to \code{open-source-rds-extended-support},
which enrolls your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the
end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by
setting the value to \code{open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled}. In
this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB cluster to a
higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of
standard support date.

You can use this setting to enroll your DB cluster into Amazon RDS
Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected
major engine version on your DB cluster past the end of standard support
for that engine version. For more information, see the following
sections:
