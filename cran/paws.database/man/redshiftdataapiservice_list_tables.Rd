\arguments{
\item{ClusterIdentifier}{The cluster identifier. This parameter is required when connecting to a
cluster and authenticating using either Secrets Manager or temporary
credentials.}

\item{ConnectedDatabase}{A database name. The connected database is specified when you connect
with your authentication credentials.}

\item{Database}{[required] The name of the database that contains the tables to list. If
\code{ConnectedDatabase} is not specified, this is also the database to
connect to with your authentication credentials.}

\item{DbUser}{The database user name. This parameter is required when connecting to a
cluster and authenticating using temporary credentials.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of tables to return in the response. If more tables
exist than fit in one response, then \code{NextToken} is returned to page
through the results.}

\item{NextToken}{A value that indicates the starting point for the next set of response
records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a response,
you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this returned
NextToken value in the next NextToken parameter and retrying the
command. If the NextToken field is empty, all response records have been
retrieved for the request.}

\item{SchemaPattern}{A pattern to filter results by schema name. Within a schema pattern, "\%"
means match any substring of 0 or more characters and "_" means match
any one character. Only schema name entries matching the search pattern
are returned. If \code{SchemaPattern} is not specified, then all tables that
match \code{TablePattern} are returned. If neither \code{SchemaPattern} or
\code{TablePattern} are specified, then all tables are returned.}

\item{SecretArn}{The name or ARN of the secret that enables access to the database. This
parameter is required when authenticating using Secrets Manager.}

\item{TablePattern}{A pattern to filter results by table name. Within a table pattern, "\%"
means match any substring of 0 or more characters and "_" means match
any one character. Only table name entries matching the search pattern
are returned. If \code{TablePattern} is not specified, then all tables that
match \code{SchemaPattern}are returned. If neither \code{SchemaPattern} or
\code{TablePattern} are specified, then all tables are returned.}

\item{WorkgroupName}{The serverless workgroup name. This parameter is required when
connecting to a serverless workgroup and authenticating using either
Secrets Manager or temporary credentials.}
}
\description{
List the tables in a database. If neither \code{SchemaPattern} nor \code{TablePattern} are specified, then all tables in the database are returned. A token is returned to page through the table list. Depending on the authorization method, use one of the following combinations of request parameters:
