\usage{
rds_modify_db_proxy(
  DBProxyName,
  NewDBProxyName = NULL,
  DefaultAuthScheme = NULL,
  Auth = NULL,
  RequireTLS = NULL,
  IdleClientTimeout = NULL,
  DebugLogging = NULL,
  RoleArn = NULL,
  SecurityGroups = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DBProxyName}{[required] The identifier for the \code{DBProxy} to modify.}

\item{NewDBProxyName}{The new identifier for the \code{DBProxy}. An identifier must begin with a
letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it
can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.}

\item{DefaultAuthScheme}{The default authentication scheme that the proxy uses for client
connections to the proxy and connections from the proxy to the
underlying database. Valid values are \code{NONE} and \code{IAM_AUTH}. When set to
\code{IAM_AUTH}, the proxy uses end-to-end IAM authentication to connect to
the database.}

\item{Auth}{The new authentication settings for the \code{DBProxy}.}

\item{RequireTLS}{Whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for
connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce
encrypted TLS connections to the proxy, even if the associated database
doesn't use TLS.}

\item{IdleClientTimeout}{The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive
before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower
than the connection timeout limit for the associated database.}

\item{DebugLogging}{Specifies whether the proxy logs detailed connection and query
information. When you enable \code{DebugLogging}, the proxy captures
connection details and connection pool behavior from your queries. Debug
logging increases CloudWatch costs and can impact proxy performance.
Enable this option only when you need to troubleshoot connection or
performance issues.}

\item{RoleArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the proxy uses to
access secrets in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.}

\item{SecurityGroups}{The new list of security groups for the \code{DBProxy}.}
