iam_set_security_token_service_preferences(GlobalEndpointTokenVersion)

\arguments{
\item{GlobalEndpointTokenVersion}{[required] The version of the global endpoint token. Version 1 tokens are valid
only in AWS Regions that are available by default. These tokens do not
work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong).
Version 2 tokens are valid in all Regions. However, version 2 tokens are
longer and might affect systems where you temporarily store tokens.

\description{
Sets the specified version of the global endpoint token as the token
version used for the AWS account.
}
\details{
By default, AWS Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global
service, and all STS requests go to a single endpoint at
\verb{https://sts.amazonaws.com}. AWS recommends using Regional STS endpoints
to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token
availability. For information about Regional endpoints for STS, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region}{AWS Regions and Endpoints}
in the \emph{AWS General Reference}.

If you make an STS call to the global endpoint, the resulting session
tokens might be valid in some Regions but not others. It depends on the
version that is set in this operation. Version 1 tokens are valid only
in AWS Regions that are available by default. These tokens do not work
in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). Version 2
tokens are valid in all Regions. However, version 2 tokens are longer
and might affect systems where you temporarily store tokens. For
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html}{Activating and Deactivating STS in an AWS Region}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

To view the current session token version, see the
\code{GlobalEndpointTokenVersion} entry in the response of the
GetAccountSummary operation.
