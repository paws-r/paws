in the \emph{CodeBuild user guide}.}

\item{computeType}{[required] Information about the compute resources the compute fleet uses.
Available values include:
\itemize{
\item \code{ATTRIBUTE_BASED_COMPUTE}: Specify the amount of vCPUs, memory, disk
space, and the type of machine.

If you use \code{ATTRIBUTE_BASED_COMPUTE}, you must define your
attributes by using \code{computeConfiguration}. CodeBuild will select
the cheapest instance that satisfies your specified attributes. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html#environment-reserved-capacity.types}{Reserved capacity environment types}
in the \emph{CodeBuild User Guide}.
\item \code{BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL}: Use up to 4 GiB memory and 2 vCPUs for
builds.
\item \code{BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM}: Use up to 8 GiB memory and 4 vCPUs for
builds.
\item \code{BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE}: Use up to 16 GiB memory and 8 vCPUs for
builds, depending on your environment type.
\item \code{BUILD_GENERAL1_XLARGE}: Use up to 72 GiB memory and 36 vCPUs for
builds, depending on your environment type.
\item \code{BUILD_GENERAL1_2XLARGE}: Use up to 144 GiB memory, 72 vCPUs, and
824 GB of SSD storage for builds. This compute type supports Docker
images up to 100 GB uncompressed.
\item \code{BUILD_LAMBDA_1GB}: Use up to 1 GiB memory for builds. Only
available for environment type \code{LINUX_LAMBDA_CONTAINER} and
\code{ARM_LAMBDA_CONTAINER}.
\item \code{BUILD_LAMBDA_2GB}: Use up to 2 GiB memory for builds. Only
available for environment type \code{LINUX_LAMBDA_CONTAINER} and
\code{ARM_LAMBDA_CONTAINER}.
\item \code{BUILD_LAMBDA_4GB}: Use up to 4 GiB memory for builds. Only
available for environment type \code{LINUX_LAMBDA_CONTAINER} and
\code{ARM_LAMBDA_CONTAINER}.
\item \code{BUILD_LAMBDA_8GB}: Use up to 8 GiB memory for builds. Only
available for environment type \code{LINUX_LAMBDA_CONTAINER} and

in the \emph{CodeBuild User Guide.}}

\item{computeConfiguration}{The compute configuration of the compute fleet. This is only required if
\code{computeType} is set to \code{ATTRIBUTE_BASED_COMPUTE}.}

\item{scalingConfiguration}{The scaling configuration of the compute fleet.}

\item{overflowBehavior}{The compute fleet overflow behavior.
\itemize{
\item For overflow behavior \code{QUEUE}, your overflow builds need to wait on
the existing fleet instance to become available.
\item For overflow behavior \code{ON_DEMAND}, your overflow builds run on
CodeBuild on-demand.

If you choose to set your overflow behavior to on-demand while
creating a VPC-connected fleet, make sure that you add the required
VPC permissions to your project service role. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-iam-identity-based-access-control.html#customer-managed-policies-example-create-vpc-network-interface}{Example policy statement to allow CodeBuild access to Amazon Web Services services required to create a VPC network interface}.

\item{vpcConfig}{}

\item{proxyConfiguration}{The proxy configuration of the compute fleet.}

\item{imageId}{The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of the compute fleet.}

\item{fleetServiceRole}{The service role associated with the compute fleet. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-iam-identity-based-access-control.html#customer-managed-policies-example-permission-policy-fleet-service-role.html}{Allow a user to add a permission policy for a fleet service role}

These tags are available for use by Amazon Web Services services that
support CodeBuild build project tags.}
