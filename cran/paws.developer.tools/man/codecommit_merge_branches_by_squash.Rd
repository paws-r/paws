codecommit_merge_branches_by_squash(
  repositoryName,
  sourceCommitSpecifier,
  destinationCommitSpecifier,
  targetBranch = NULL,
  conflictDetailLevel = NULL,
  conflictResolutionStrategy = NULL,
  authorName = NULL,
  email = NULL,
  commitMessage = NULL,
  keepEmptyFolders = NULL,
  conflictResolution = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{repositoryName}{[required] The name of the repository where you want to merge two branches.}

\item{sourceCommitSpecifier}{[required] The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).}

\item{destinationCommitSpecifier}{[required] The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).}

\item{targetBranch}{The branch where the merge is applied.}

\item{conflictDetailLevel}{The level of conflict detail to use. If unspecified, the default
FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
conflict is considered not mergeable if the same file in both branches
has differences on the same line.}

\item{conflictResolutionStrategy}{Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts, or whether to
attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default is
NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before the
merge operation is successful.}

\item{authorName}{The name of the author who created the commit. This information is used
as both the author and committer for the commit.}

\item{email}{The email address of the person merging the branches. This information
is used in the commit information for the merge.}

\item{commitMessage}{The commit message for the merge.}

\item{keepEmptyFolders}{If the commit contains deletions, whether to keep a folder or folder
structure if the changes leave the folders empty. If this is specified
as true, a .gitkeep file is created for empty folders. The default is
false.}

\item{conflictResolution}{If AUTOMERGE is the conflict resolution strategy, a list of inputs to
use when resolving conflicts during a merge.}
