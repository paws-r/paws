Uploads segment documents to Amazon Web Services X-Ray. The \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/index.html}{X-Ray SDK} generates segment documents and sends them to the X-Ray daemon, which uploads them in batches. A segment document can be a completed segment, an in-progress segment, or an array of subsegments.
