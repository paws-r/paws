\arguments{
\item{domain}{[required] The name of the domain that contains the repository that contains the

\item{repository}{[required] The name of the repository that contains the package.}

\item{format}{[required] A format that specifies the type of the package to be updated.}

\item{namespace}{The namespace of the package to be updated. The package component that
specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:
\itemize{
\item The namespace of a Maven package is its \code{groupId}.
\item The namespace of an npm package is its \code{scope}.
\item Python and NuGet packages do not contain a corresponding component,
packages of those formats do not have a namespace.

\item{package}{[required] The name of the package to be updated.}

\item{restrictions}{[required] A
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/APIReference/API_PackageOriginRestrictions.html}{PackageOriginRestrictions}
object that contains information about the \code{upstream} and \code{publish}
package origin restrictions. The \code{upstream} restriction determines if
new package versions can be ingested or retained from external
connections or upstream repositories. The \code{publish} restriction
determines if new package versions can be published directly to the
repository.

You must include both the desired \code{upstream} and \code{publish} restrictions.}
