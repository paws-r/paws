codebuild_list_shared_report_groups(sortOrder, sortBy, nextToken,

\itemize{
\item \code{ASCENDING}: List in ascending order.
\item \code{DESCENDING}: List in descending order.

\item \code{MODIFIED_TIME}: List based on when information about the shared

\item{nextToken}{During a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be returned
is the value specified in \code{maxResults}. If there more items in the list,
then a unique string called a \emph{nextToken} is returned. To get the next

token to the call. To get all of the items in the list, keep calling
this operation with each subsequent next token that is returned, until
no more next tokens are returned.}
