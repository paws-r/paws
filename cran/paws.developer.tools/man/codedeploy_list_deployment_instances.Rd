\usage{
codedeploy_list_deployment_instances(
  deploymentId,
  nextToken = NULL,
  instanceStatusFilter = NULL,
  instanceTypeFilter = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deploymentId}{[required] The unique ID of a deployment.}

\item{nextToken}{An identifier returned from the previous list deployment instances call.
It can be used to return the next set of deployment instances in the
list.}

\item{instanceStatusFilter}{A subset of instances to list by status:
\itemize{
\item \code{Pending}: Include those instances with pending deployments.
\item \code{InProgress}: Include those instances where deployments are still in
progress.
\item \code{Succeeded}: Include those instances with successful deployments.
\item \code{Failed}: Include those instances with failed deployments.
\item \code{Skipped}: Include those instances with skipped deployments.
\item \code{Unknown}: Include those instances with deployments in an unknown
state.
}}

\item{instanceTypeFilter}{The set of instances in a blue/green deployment, either those in the
original environment ("BLUE") or those in the replacement environment
("GREEN"), for which you want to view instance information.}
}
\description{
The newer \code{\link[=codedeploy_batch_get_deployment_targets]{batch_get_deployment_targets}} should be used instead because it works with all compute types. \code{\link[=codedeploy_list_deployment_instances]{list_deployment_instances}} throws an exception if it is used with a compute platform other than EC2/On-premises or AWS Lambda.
