Returns a list of Jobs. Use the JobsID and fromDate and toDate filters to limit which jobs are returned. The response is sorted by creationDataTime - latest date first. Jobs are created by the StartRecovery, TerminateRecoveryInstances and StartFailbackLaunch APIs. Jobs are also created by DiagnosticLaunch and TerminateDiagnosticInstances, which are APIs available only to \emph{Support} and only used in response to relevant support tickets.
