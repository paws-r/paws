\title{Creates an approval rule for a pull request}
\usage{
codecommit_create_pull_request_approval_rule(pullRequestId,
  approvalRuleName, approvalRuleContent)
}
\arguments{
\item{pullRequestId}{[required] The system-generated ID of the pull request for which you want to create
the approval rule.}

\item{approvalRuleName}{[required] The name for the approval rule.}

\item{approvalRuleContent}{[required] The content of the approval rule, including the number of approvals
needed and the structure of an approval pool defined for approvals, if
any. For more information about approval pools, see the AWS CodeCommit
User Guide.

When you create the content of the approval rule, you can specify
approvers in an approval pool in one of two ways:
\itemize{
\item \strong{CodeCommitApprovers}: This option only requires an AWS account
and a resource. It can be used for both IAM users and federated
access users whose name matches the provided resource name. This is
a very powerful option that offers a great deal of flexibility. For
example, if you specify the AWS account \emph{123456789012} and
\emph{Mary\\_Major}, all of the following would be counted as approvals
coming from that user:
\itemize{
\item An IAM user in the account
(arn:aws:iam::\emph{123456789012}:user/\emph{Mary\\_Major})
\item A federated user identified in IAM as Mary\\_Major
(arn:aws:sts::\emph{123456789012}:federated-user/\emph{Mary\\_Major})
}

This option does not recognize an active session of someone assuming
the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name of
\emph{Mary\\_Major}
(arn:aws:sts::\emph{123456789012}:assumed-role/CodeCommitReview/\emph{Mary\\_Major})
unless you include a wildcard (*Mary\\_Major).
\item \strong{Fully qualified ARN}: This option allows you to specify the fully
qualified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or role.
}

For more information about IAM ARNs, wildcards, and formats, see IAM
Identifiers in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.}
