\usage{
codepipeline_delete_custom_action_type(category, provider, version)
}
\arguments{
\item{category}{[required] The category of the custom action that you want to delete, such as
source or deploy.}

\item{provider}{[required] The provider of the service used in the custom action, such as AWS
CodeDeploy.}

\item{version}{[required] The version of the custom action to delete.}

\description{
Marks a custom action as deleted. \code{PollForJobs} for the custom action
fails after the action is marked for deletion. Used for custom actions
only.
}
\details{
To re-create a custom action after it has been deleted you must use a
string in the version field that has never been used before. This string
can be an incremented version number, for example. To restore a deleted
custom action, use a JSON file that is identical to the deleted action,
including the original string in the version field.
