\usage{
codepipeline_put_approval_result(
  pipelineName,
  stageName,
  actionName,
  result,
  token
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pipelineName}{[required] The name of the pipeline that contains the action.}

\item{stageName}{[required] The name of the stage that contains the action.}

\item{actionName}{[required] The name of the action for which approval is requested.}

\item{result}{[required] Represents information about the result of the approval request.}

\item{token}{[required] The system-generated token used to identify a unique approval request.
The token for each open approval request can be obtained using the
\code{\link[=codepipeline_get_pipeline_state]{get_pipeline_state}} action. It is
used to validate that the approval request corresponding to this token
is still valid.

For a pipeline where the execution mode is set to PARALLEL, the token
required to approve/reject approval request as detailed above is not
available. Instead, use the \code{externalExecutionId} from the
\code{\link[=codepipeline_get_pipeline_state]{get_pipeline_state}} action as the
token in the approval request.}
