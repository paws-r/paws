codestar_disassociate_team_member(projectId, userArn)

member.}

\description{
Removes a user from a project. Removing a user from a project also
removes the IAM policies from that user that allowed access to the
project and its resources. Disassociating a team member does not remove
that user\'s profile from AWS CodeStar. It does not remove the user from
IAM.
