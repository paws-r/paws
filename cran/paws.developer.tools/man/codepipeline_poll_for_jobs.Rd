}
\arguments{
\item{actionTypeId}{[required] Represents information about an action type.}

\item{maxBatchSize}{The maximum number of jobs to return in a poll for jobs call.}

\item{queryParam}{A map of property names and values. For an action type with no queryable

\description{
Returns information about any jobs for AWS CodePipeline to act on.
\code{PollForJobs} is valid only for action types with \"Custom\" in the
owner field. If the action type contains \"AWS\" or \"ThirdParty\" in
the owner field, the \code{PollForJobs} action returns an error.
}
\details{
When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary credentials
for the Amazon S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if
the action requires access to that Amazon S3 bucket for input or output
artifacts. This API also returns any secret values defined for the
action.
