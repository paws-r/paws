\description{
For a blue/green deployment, starts the process of rerouting traffic
from instances in the original environment to instances in the
replacement environment without waiting for a specified wait time to
elapse. (Traffic rerouting, which is achieved by registering instances
in the replacement environment with the load balancer, can start as soon
as all instances have a status of Ready.)
