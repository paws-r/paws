#' @description
#' CodePipeline
#' 
#' **Overview**
#' 
#' This is the CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions
#' of the actions and data types for CodePipeline. Some functionality for
#' your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more
#' information, see the [CodePipeline User
#' Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
#' 
#' You can use the CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages,
#' actions, and transitions.
#' 
#' *Pipelines* are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is
#' uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions.
#' 
#' You can work with pipelines by calling:
#' 
#' -   [`create_pipeline`][codepipeline_create_pipeline], which creates a
#'     uniquely named pipeline.
#' 
#' -   [`delete_pipeline`][codepipeline_delete_pipeline], which deletes the
#'     specified pipeline.
#' 
#' -   [`get_pipeline`][codepipeline_get_pipeline], which returns
#'     information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata,
#'     including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
#' 
#' -   [`get_pipeline_execution`][codepipeline_get_pipeline_execution],
#'     which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline.
#' 
#' -   [`get_pipeline_state`][codepipeline_get_pipeline_state], which
#'     returns information about the current state of the stages and
#'     actions of a pipeline.
#' 
#' -   [`list_action_executions`][codepipeline_list_action_executions],
#'     which returns action-level details for past executions. The details
#'     include full stage and action-level details, including individual
#'     action duration, status, any errors that occurred during the
#'     execution, and input and output artifact location details.
#' 
#' -   [`list_pipelines`][codepipeline_list_pipelines], which gets a
#'     summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account.
#' 
#' -   [`list_pipeline_executions`][codepipeline_list_pipeline_executions],
#'     which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline.
#' 
#' -   [`start_pipeline_execution`][codepipeline_start_pipeline_execution],
#'     which runs the most recent revision of an artifact through the
#'     pipeline.
#' 
#' -   [`stop_pipeline_execution`][codepipeline_stop_pipeline_execution],
#'     which stops the specified pipeline execution from continuing through
#'     the pipeline.
#' 
#' -   [`update_pipeline`][codepipeline_update_pipeline], which updates a
#'     pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline.
#' 
#' Pipelines include *stages*. Each stage contains one or more actions that
#' must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success
#' or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and
#' remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the
#' source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent
#' artifact through the pipeline. You can call
#' [`get_pipeline_state`][codepipeline_get_pipeline_state], which displays
#' the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the
#' pipeline, or [`get_pipeline`][codepipeline_get_pipeline], which returns
#' the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that
#' pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and
#' actions, see [CodePipeline Pipeline Structure
#' Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html).
#' 
#' Pipeline stages include *actions* that are categorized into categories
#' such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For
#' example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline
#' from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with
#' actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with
#' actions when working with pipeline operations such as
#' [`create_pipeline`][codepipeline_create_pipeline] and
#' [`get_pipeline_state`][codepipeline_get_pipeline_state]. Valid action
#' categories are:
#' 
#' -   Source
#' 
#' -   Build
#' 
#' -   Test
#' 
#' -   Deploy
#' 
#' -   Approval
#' 
#' -   Invoke
#' 
#' -   Compute
#' 
#' Pipelines also include *transitions*, which allow the transition of
#' artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in
#' one stage complete.
#' 
#' You can work with transitions by calling:
#' 
#' -   [`disable_stage_transition`][codepipeline_disable_stage_transition],
#'     which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a
#'     pipeline.
#' 
#' -   [`enable_stage_transition`][codepipeline_enable_stage_transition],
#'     which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline.
#' 
#' **Using the API to integrate with CodePipeline**
#' 
#' For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own
#' integrations with CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the
#' standard API user. To integrate with CodePipeline, developers need to
#' work with the following items:
#' 
#' **Jobs**, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a
#' source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source.
#' 
#' You can work with jobs by calling:
#' 
#' -   [`acknowledge_job`][codepipeline_acknowledge_job], which confirms
#'     whether a job worker has received the specified job.
#' 
#' -   [`get_job_details`][codepipeline_get_job_details], which returns the
#'     details of a job.
#' 
#' -   [`poll_for_jobs`][codepipeline_poll_for_jobs], which determines
#'     whether there are any jobs to act on.
#' 
#' -   [`put_job_failure_result`][codepipeline_put_job_failure_result],
#'     which provides details of a job failure.
#' 
#' -   [`put_job_success_result`][codepipeline_put_job_success_result],
#'     which provides details of a job success.
#' 
#' **Third party jobs**, which are instances of an action created by a
#' partner action and integrated into CodePipeline. Partner actions are
#' created by members of the Amazon Web Services Partner Network.
#' 
#' You can work with third party jobs by calling:
#' 
#' -   [`acknowledge_third_party_job`][codepipeline_acknowledge_third_party_job],
#'     which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.
#' 
#' -   [`get_third_party_job_details`][codepipeline_get_third_party_job_details],
#'     which requests the details of a job for a partner action.
#' 
#' -   [`poll_for_third_party_jobs`][codepipeline_poll_for_third_party_jobs],
#'     which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.
#' 
#' -   [`put_third_party_job_failure_result`][codepipeline_put_third_party_job_failure_result],
#'     which provides details of a job failure.
#' 
#' -   [`put_third_party_job_success_result`][codepipeline_put_third_party_job_success_result],
#'     which provides details of a job success.
