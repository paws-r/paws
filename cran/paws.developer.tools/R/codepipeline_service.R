#'
#' @description
#' **Overview**
#' 
#' This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides
#' descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some
#' functionality for your pipeline can only be configured through the API.
#' For more information, see the [AWS CodePipeline User
#' Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
#' 
#' You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages,
#' actions, and transitions.
#' 
#' *Pipelines* are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is
#' uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions.
#' 
#' You can work with pipelines by calling:
#' 
#' -   CreatePipeline, which creates a uniquely named pipeline.
#' 
#' -   DeletePipeline, which deletes the specified pipeline.
#' 
#' -   GetPipeline, which returns information about the pipeline structure
#'     and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name
#'     (ARN).
#' 
#' -   GetPipelineExecution, which returns information about a specific
#'     execution of a pipeline.
#' 
#' -   GetPipelineState, which returns information about the current state
#'     of the stages and actions of a pipeline.
#' 
#' -   ListActionExecutions, which returns action-level details for past
#'     executions. The details include full stage and action-level details,
#'     including individual action duration, status, any errors that
#'     occurred during the execution, and input and output artifact
#'     location details.
#' 
#' -   ListPipelines, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines
#'     associated with your account.
#' 
#' -   ListPipelineExecutions, which gets a summary of the most recent
#'     executions for a pipeline.
#' 
#' -   StartPipelineExecution, which runs the most recent revision of an
#'     artifact through the pipeline.
#' 
#' -   UpdatePipeline, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to
#'     the structure of the pipeline.
#' 
#' Pipelines include *stages*. Each stage contains one or more actions that
#' must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success
#' or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and
#' remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the
#' source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent
#' artifact through the pipeline. You can call GetPipelineState, which
#' displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the
#' pipeline, or GetPipeline, which returns the entire structure of the
#' pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information
#' about the structure of stages and actions, see [AWS CodePipeline
#' Pipeline Structure
#' Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html).
#' 
#' Pipeline stages include *actions* that are categorized into categories
#' such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For
#' example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline
#' from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with
#' actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with
#' actions when working with pipeline operations such as CreatePipeline and
#' GetPipelineState. Valid action categories are:
#' 
#' -   Source
#' 
#' -   Build
#' 
#' -   Test
#' 
#' -   Deploy
#' 
#' -   Approval
#' 
#' -   Invoke
#' 
#' Pipelines also include *transitions*, which allow the transition of
#' artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in
#' one stage complete.
#' 
#' You can work with transitions by calling:
#' 
#' -   DisableStageTransition, which prevents artifacts from transitioning
#'     to the next stage in a pipeline.
#' 
#' -   EnableStageTransition, which enables transition of artifacts between
#'     stages in a pipeline.
#' 
#' **Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline**
#' 
#' For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own
#' integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from
#' the standard API user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers
#' need to work with the following items:
#' 
#' **Jobs**, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a
#' source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source.
#' 
#' You can work with jobs by calling:
#' 
#' -   AcknowledgeJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the
#'     specified job.
#' 
#' -   GetJobDetails, which returns the details of a job.
#' 
#' -   PollForJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.
#' 
#' -   PutJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure.
#' 
#' -   PutJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success.
#' 
#' **Third party jobs**, which are instances of an action created by a
#' partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are
#' created by members of the AWS Partner Network.
#' 
#' You can work with third party jobs by calling:
#' 
#' -   AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob, which confirms whether a job worker has
#'     received the specified job.
#' 
#' -   GetThirdPartyJobDetails, which requests the details of a job for a
#'     partner action.
#' 
#' -   PollForThirdPartyJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs
#'     to act on.
#' 
#' -   PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job
#'     failure.
#' 
#' -   PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job
#'     success.
#'
#' @param
#' config
#' Optional configuration of credentials, endpoint, and/or region.
#'
#' @section Service syntax:
#' ```
#' svc <- codepipeline(
#'   config = list(

#'       creds = list(
#'         access_key_id = "string",
