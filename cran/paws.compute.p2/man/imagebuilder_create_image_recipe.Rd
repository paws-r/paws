\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] The name of the image recipe.}

\item{description}{The description of the image recipe.}

\item{semanticVersion}{[required] The semantic version of the image recipe. This version follows the
semantic version syntax.

The semantic version has four nodes:
\<major\>.\<minor\>.\<patch\>/\<build\>. You can assign values for the
first three, and can filter on all of them.

\strong{Assignment:} For the first three nodes you can assign any positive
integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or
1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically assigns the build
number to the fourth node.

\strong{Patterns:} You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For example,
you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date,
such as 2021.01.01.}

\item{components}{[required] The components of the image recipe.}

\item{parentImage}{[required] The base image of the image recipe. The value of the string can be the
ARN of the base image or an AMI ID. The format for the ARN follows this
example:
\code{arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:aws:image/windows-server-2016-english-full-base-x86/x.x.x}.
You can provide the specific version that you want to use, or you can
use a wildcard in all of the fields. If you enter an AMI ID for the
string value, you must have access to the AMI, and the AMI must be in
the same Region in which you are using Image Builder.}

\item{blockDeviceMappings}{The block device mappings of the image recipe.}

\item{tags}{The tags of the image recipe.}

\item{workingDirectory}{The working directory used during build and test workflows.}

\item{additionalInstanceConfiguration}{Specify additional settings and launch scripts for your build instances.}

\item{clientToken}{[required] The idempotency token used to make this request idempotent.}
