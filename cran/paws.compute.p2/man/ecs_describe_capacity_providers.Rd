\usage{
ecs_describe_capacity_providers(
  capacityProviders = NULL,
  include = NULL,
  maxResults = NULL,
  nextToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{capacityProviders}{The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of one or more
capacity providers. Up to \code{100} capacity providers can be described in
an action.}

\item{include}{Specifies whether or not you want to see the resource tags for the
capacity provider. If \code{TAGS} is specified, the tags are included in the
response. If this field is omitted, tags aren't included in the
response.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of account setting results returned by
\code{\link[=ecs_describe_capacity_providers]{describe_capacity_providers}} in
paginated output. When this parameter is used,
\code{\link[=ecs_describe_capacity_providers]{describe_capacity_providers}} only
returns \code{maxResults} results in a single page along with a \code{nextToken}
response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be
seen by sending another
\code{\link[=ecs_describe_capacity_providers]{describe_capacity_providers}} request
with the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1 and 10.
If this parameter is not used, then
\code{\link[=ecs_describe_capacity_providers]{describe_capacity_providers}} returns
up to 10 results and a \code{nextToken} value if applicable.}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=ecs_describe_capacity_providers]{describe_capacity_providers}} request
where \code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value of that
parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results
that returned the \code{nextToken} value.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used
to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
purposes.}
