\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] The name of the component.}

\item{semanticVersion}{[required] The semantic version of the component. This version follows the semantic
version syntax.

The semantic version has four nodes:
\<major\>.\<minor\>.\<patch\>/\<build\>. You can assign values for the
first three, and can filter on all of them.

\strong{Assignment:} For the first three nodes you can assign any positive
integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or
1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically assigns the build
number to the fourth node.

\strong{Patterns:} You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For example,
you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date,
such as 2021.01.01.}

\item{description}{The description of the component. Describes the contents of the
component.}

\item{changeDescription}{The change description of the component. Describes what change has been
made in this version, or what makes this version different from other
versions of this component.}

\item{platform}{[required] The platform of the component.}

\item{supportedOsVersions}{The operating system (OS) version supported by the component. If the OS
information is available, a prefix match is performed against the base
image OS version during image recipe creation.}

\item{data}{Component \code{data} contains inline YAML document content for the
component. Alternatively, you can specify the \code{uri} of a YAML document
file stored in Amazon S3. However, you cannot specify both properties.}

\item{uri}{The \code{uri} of a YAML component document file. This must be an S3 URL
(\verb{s3://bucket/key}), and the requester must have permission to access
the S3 bucket it points to. If you use Amazon S3, you can specify
component content up to your service quota.

Alternatively, you can specify the YAML document inline, using the
component \code{data} property. You cannot specify both properties.}

\item{kmsKeyId}{The ID of the KMS key that should be used to encrypt this component.}

\item{tags}{The tags of the component.}

\item{clientToken}{[required] The idempotency token of the component.}
}
\description{
Creates a new component that can be used to build, validate, test, and assess your image. The component is based on a YAML document that you specify using exactly one of the following methods:
