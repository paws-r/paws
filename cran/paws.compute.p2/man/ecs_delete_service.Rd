ecs_delete_service(cluster = NULL, service, force = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster}{The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that
hosts the service to delete. If you do not specify a cluster, the
default cluster is assumed.}

\item{service}{[required] The name of the service to delete.}

\description{
Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the service is actively maintaining tasks, you can't delete it, and you must update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information, see \code{\link[=ecs_update_service]{update_service}}.
