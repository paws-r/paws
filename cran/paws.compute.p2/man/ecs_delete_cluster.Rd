\description{
Deletes the specified cluster. The cluster transitions to the \code{INACTIVE} state. Clusters with an \code{INACTIVE} status might remain discoverable in your account for a period of time. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future. We don't recommend that you rely on \code{INACTIVE} clusters persisting.
