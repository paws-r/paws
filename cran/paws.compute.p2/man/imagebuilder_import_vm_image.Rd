)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] The name of the base image that is created by the import process.}

\item{semanticVersion}{[required] The semantic version to attach to the base image that was created during
the import process. This version follows the semantic version syntax.

The semantic version has four nodes:
\<major\>.\<minor\>.\<patch\>/\<build\>. You can assign values for the
first three, and can filter on all of them.

\strong{Assignment:} For the first three nodes you can assign any positive
integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or
1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically assigns the build
number to the fourth node.

\strong{Patterns:} You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For example,
you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date,
such as 2021.01.01.}

\item{description}{The description for the base image that is created by the import
process.}

\item{platform}{[required] The operating system platform for the imported VM.}

\item{osVersion}{The operating system version for the imported VM.}

\item{vmImportTaskId}{[required] The \code{importTaskId} (API) or \code{ImportTaskId} (CLI) from the Amazon EC2 VM
import process. Image Builder retrieves information from the import
process to pull in the AMI that is created from the VM source as the
base image for your recipe.}

\item{tags}{Tags that are attached to the import resources.}

\item{clientToken}{[required] Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency of
the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html}{Ensuring idempotency}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 API Reference}.}

\description{
When you export your virtual machine (VM) from its virtualization environment, that process creates a set of one or more disk container files that act as snapshots of your VM’s environment, settings, and data. The Amazon EC2 API \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ImportImage.html}{ImportImage} action uses those files to import your VM and create an AMI. To import using the CLI command, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/import-image.html}{import-image}
