\description{
Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help
you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web
Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically
extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and
network traffic from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon
VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.

The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of
behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set
of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator
account.

To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account
sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the
invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.

Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization
management account designates the Detective administrator account for
the organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the
organization behavior graph. The Detective administrator account is also
the delegated administrator account for Detective in Organizations.

The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account
as a member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization
accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account
can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.

Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API
to manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated
with the currently selected endpoint.

The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API
to do the following:
\itemize{
\item Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
behavior graph.
\item View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.
\item Add member accounts to a behavior graph.
\item Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.
\item Apply tags to a behavior graph.
}

The organization management account can use the Detective API to select
the delegated administrator for Detective.

The Detective administrator account for an organization can use the
Detective API to do the following:
\itemize{
\item Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.
\item Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts
as member accounts in the organization behavior graph.
}

An invited member account can use the Detective API to do the following:
\itemize{
\item View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.
\item Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
\item Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
\item Remove their account from a behavior graph.
}

All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html}{Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail}.

We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator
account." An administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple
accounts. In the case of Detective, the administrator account manages
the accounts in their behavior graph.
