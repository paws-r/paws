\item{filter}{You can use this parameter to specify a subset of data to be included in
the action's response.

the values can match.}

with the value of \strong{NextToken} from the previous response to continue
listing data.}

\item{maxResults}{You can use this parameter to indicate the maximum number of items you
want in the response. The default value is 10. The maximum value is 500.}
