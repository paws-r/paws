\title{Adds the specified list of principals and list of resources to a
resource share}
\usage{
ram_associate_resource_share(
  resourceShareArn,
  resourceArns = NULL,
  principals = NULL,
  clientToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{resourceShareArn}{[required] Specifies the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html}{Amazon Resoure Name (ARN)}
of the resource share that you want to add principals or resources to.}

\item{resourceArns}{Specifies a list of \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html}{Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)}
of the resources that you want to share. This can be \code{null} if you want
to add only principals.}

\item{principals}{Specifies a list of principals to whom you want to the resource share.
This can be \code{null} if you want to add only resources.

What the principals can do with the resources in the share is determined
by the RAM permissions that you associate with the resource share. See
\code{\link[=ram_associate_resource_share_permission]{associate_resource_share_permission}}.

You can include the following values:
\itemize{
\item An Amazon Web Services account ID, for example: \code{123456789012}
\item An \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html}{Amazon Resoure Name (ARN)}
of an organization in Organizations, for example:
\verb{organizations::123456789012:organization/o-exampleorgid}
\item An ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations, for example:
\verb{organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-examplerootid-exampleouid123}
\item An ARN of an IAM role, for example:
\verb{iam::123456789012:role/rolename}
\item An ARN of an IAM user, for example: \verb{iam::123456789012user/username}
}

Not all resource types can be shared with IAM roles and users. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/#permissions-rbp-supported-resource-types}{Sharing with IAM roles and users}
in the \emph{Resource Access Manager User Guide}.}

\item{clientToken}{Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request
without accidentally performing the same operation a second time.
Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you
also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you
use a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier}{UUID type of value.}.

If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a
random one for you.}
