\title{Deletes all rule groups that are managed by Firewall Manager for the
specified web ACL}
\usage{
wafv2_delete_firewall_manager_rule_groups(WebACLArn, WebACLLockToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{WebACLArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL.}

\item{WebACLLockToken}{[required] A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your \code{get}
and \code{list} requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the
request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you
provide the token to operations like \code{update} and \code{delete}. WAF uses the
token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you
last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a
\code{WAFOptimisticLockException}. If this happens, perform another \code{get},
and use the new token returned by that operation.}
