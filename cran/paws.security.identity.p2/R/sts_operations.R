#' @description
#' Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html) and [Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison) in the *IAM User Guide*.

#' See [https://paws-r.github.io/docs/sts/assume_role.html](https://paws-r.github.io/docs/sts/assume_role.html) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param RoleArn &#91;required&#93; The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.
#' @param RoleSessionName &#91;required&#93; An identifier for the assumed role session.
#' 
#' Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same
#' role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In
#' cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be
#' logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also
#' used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that
#' subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security
#' credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in
#' their CloudTrail logs.
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: =,.@@-
#' @param PolicyArns The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
#' want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the
#' same account as the role.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy
#' ARNs. However, the plaintext that you use for both inline and managed
#' session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information
#' about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services
#' Service
#' Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
#' in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
#' 
#' An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies
#' and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.
#' Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the
#' other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' 
#' Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
#' The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's
#' identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's
#' temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to
#' access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use
#' session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
#' identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
#' information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param Policy An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session
#' policy.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns
#' new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the
#' intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session
#' policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent
#' Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that
#' owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions
#' than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is
#' being assumed. For more information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies
#' can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
#' ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid
#' character list (`U+0020` through `U+00FF`). It can also include the tab
#' (`U+0009`), linefeed (`U+000A`), and carriage return (`U+000D`) characters.
#' 
#' An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies
#' and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.
#' Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the
#' other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' @param DurationSeconds The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can
#' range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
#' set for the role. The maximum session duration setting can have a value
#' from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting
#' or the administrator setting (whichever is lower), the operation fails.
#' For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your
#' administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your
#' operation fails.
#' 
#' Role chaining limits your Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services
#' API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the
#' [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] API operation to assume a role, you can
#' specify the duration of your role session with the `DurationSeconds`
#' parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12
#' hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role.
#' However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a
#' `DurationSeconds` parameter value greater than one hour, the operation
#' fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [View
#' the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a
#' Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' By default, the value is set to `3600` seconds.
#' 
#' The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a
#' console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
#' The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes
#' a `SessionDuration` parameter that specifies the maximum length of the
#' console session. For more information, see [Creating a URL that Enables
#' Federated Users to Access the Amazon Web Services Management
#' Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param Tags A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists
#' of a key name and an associated value. For more information about
#' session tags, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services STS
#' Sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The
#' plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters, and the values
#' can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see [IAM
#' and STS Character
#' Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies
#' and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.
#' Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the
#' other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' 
#' You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already
#' attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with
#' the same key.
#' 
#' Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
#' means that you cannot have separate `Department` and `department` tag
#' keys. Assume that the role has the `Department`=`Marketing` tag and you
#' pass the `department`=`engineering` session tag. `Department` and
#' `department` are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed
#' in the request takes precedence over the role tag.
#' 
#' Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this
#' operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from the
#' calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an
#' inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a
#' session, see the CloudTrail logs. For more information, see [Viewing
#' Session Tags in
#' CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_ctlogs)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param TransitiveTagKeys A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If
#' you set a tag key as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes
#' to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see
#' [Chaining Roles with Session
#' Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. When you set session tags as transitive, the
#' session policy and session tags packed binary limit is not affected.
#' 
#' If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are
#' passed from this session to any subsequent sessions.
#' @param ExternalId A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in
#' another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role
#' belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the
#' `ExternalId` parameter. This value can be any string, such as a
#' passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to
#' trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the
#' trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the
#' trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role,
#' rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the
#' external ID, see [How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your
#' Amazon Web Services Resources to a Third
#' Party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: =,.@@:/-
#' @param SerialNumber The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the
#' user who is making the [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] call. Specify
#' this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a
#' condition that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the
#' serial number for a hardware device (such as `GAHT12345678`) or an
#' Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as
#' `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`).
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: =,.@@-
#' @param TokenCode The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role
#' being assumed requires MFA. (In other words, if the policy includes a
#' condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA
#' and if the `TokenCode` value is missing or expired, the
#' [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] call returns an "access denied" error.
#' 
#' The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
#' sequence of six numeric digits.
#' @param SourceIdentity The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the
#' [`assume_role`][sts_assume_role] operation.
#' 
#' You can require users to specify a source identity when they assume a
#' role. You do this by using the `sts:SourceIdentity` condition key in a
#' role trust policy. You can use source identity information in CloudTrail
#' logs to determine who took actions with a role. You can use the
#' `aws:SourceIdentity` condition key to further control access to Amazon
#' Web Services resources based on the value of source identity. For more
#' information about using source identity, see [Monitor and control
#' actions taken with assumed
#' roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: =,.@@-. You cannot use a value that begins with the text
#' `aws:`. This prefix is reserved for Amazon Web Services internal use.

#'
#' @description
#' Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. You must call the [`get_federation_token`][sts_get_federation_token] operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of [`get_federation_token`][sts_get_federation_token] with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html) and [Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison) in the *IAM User Guide*.
#'
#' See [https://paws-r.github.io/docs/sts/get_federation_token.html](https://paws-r.github.io/docs/sts/get_federation_token.html) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; The name of the federated user. The name is used as an identifier for
#' the temporary security credentials (such as `Bob`). For example, you can
#' reference the federated user name in a resource-based policy, such as in
#' an Amazon S3 bucket policy.
#' 
#' The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
#' consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
#' spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
#' characters: =,.@@-
#' @param Policy An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session
#' policy.
#' 
#' You must pass an inline or managed [session
#' policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
#' an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
#' to use as managed session policies.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. However, if you do not pass any session
#' policies, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions.
#' 
#' When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the
#' intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you
#' pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a
#' federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more
#' permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the
#' IAM user. For more information, see [Session
#' Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' The resulting credentials can be used to access a resource that has a
#' resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the
#' federated user session in the `Principal` element of the policy, the
#' session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are
#' granted in addition to the permissions that are granted by the session
#' policies.
#' 
#' The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies
#' can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any
#' ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid
#' character list (`U+0020` through `U+00FF`). It can also include the tab
#' (`U+0009`), linefeed (`U+000A`), and carriage return (`U+000D`) characters.
#' 
#' An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies
#' and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit.
#' Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the
#' other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' @param PolicyArns The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
#' want to use as a managed session policy. The policies must exist in the
#' same account as the IAM user that is requesting federated access.
#' 
#' You must pass an inline or managed [session
#' policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session)
#' to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
#' an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
#' to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both
#' inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. You
#' can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs. For more information about
#' ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service
#' Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
#' in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. However, if you do not pass any session
#' policies, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions.

#' other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by
#' percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the
#' upper size limit.
#' @param DurationSeconds The duration, in seconds, that the session should last. Acceptable
#' durations for federation sessions range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to
#' 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12 hours) as the
#' default. Sessions obtained using Amazon Web Services account root user
#' credentials are restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If
#' the specified duration is longer than one hour, the session obtained by
#' using root user credentials defaults to one hour.
#' @param Tags A list of session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an
#' associated value. For more information about session tags, see [Passing
#' Session Tags in
#' STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The
#' plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters and the values
#' can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see [IAM
#' and STS Character
#' Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length)

#' 
#' You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already
#' attached to the user you are federating. When you do, session tags
#' override a user tag with the same key.
#' 
#' Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
#' means that you cannot have separate `Department` and `department` tag
#' keys. Assume that the role has the `Department`=`Marketing` tag and you
#' pass the `department`=`engineering` session tag. `Department` and
#' `department` are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed
#' in the request takes precedence over the role tag.

#' Returns a set of temporary credentials for an Amazon Web Services
#' account or IAM user
#'
#' @description
#' Returns a set of temporary credentials for an Amazon Web Services account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use [`get_session_token`][sts_get_session_token] if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific Amazon Web Services API operations like Amazon EC2 `StopInstances`. MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call [`get_session_token`][sts_get_session_token] and submit an MFA code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error. For a comparison of [`get_session_token`][sts_get_session_token] with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html) and [Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison) in the *IAM User Guide*.

#' Acceptable durations for IAM user sessions range from 900 seconds (15

#' as the default. Sessions for Amazon Web Services account owners are
#' restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If the duration is
#' longer than one hour, the session for Amazon Web Services account owners
#' defaults to one hour.
#' @param SerialNumber The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the
#' IAM user who is making the [`get_session_token`][sts_get_session_token]
#' call. Specify this value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA
#' authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware
#' device (such as `GAHT12345678`) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
#' virtual device (such as `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`). You can
#' find the device for an IAM user by going to the Amazon Web Services
#' Management Console and viewing the user's security credentials.
