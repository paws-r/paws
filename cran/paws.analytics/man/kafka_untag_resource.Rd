\usage{
kafka_untag_resource(ResourceArn, TagKeys)
}
\arguments{
\item{ResourceArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the resource
that's associated with the tags.}

\item{TagKeys}{[required] Tag keys must be unique for a given cluster. In addition, the following
restrictions apply:
\itemize{
\item Each tag key must be unique. If you add a tag with a key that's
already in use, your new tag overwrites the existing key-value pair.
\item You can't start a tag key with aws: because this prefix is reserved
for use by AWS. AWS creates tags that begin with this prefix on your
behalf, but you can't edit or delete them.
\item Tag keys must be between 1 and 128 Unicode characters in length.
\item Tag keys must consist of the following characters: Unicode letters,
digits, white space, and the following special characters: _ . /
= + - @.
}}
