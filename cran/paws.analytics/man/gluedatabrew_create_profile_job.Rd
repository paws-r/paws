  Name,
  LogSubscription = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{DatasetName}{[required] The name of the dataset that this job is to act upon.}

\item{EncryptionKeyArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an encryption key that is used to
protect the job.}

\item{EncryptionMode}{The encryption mode for the job, which can be one of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{SSE-KMS} - \code{SSE-KMS} - Server-side encryption with KMS-managed
keys.
\item \code{SSE-S3} - Server-side encryption with keys managed by Amazon S3.
}}

\item{Name}{[required] The name of the job to be created. Valid characters are alphanumeric
(A-Z, a-z, 0-9), hyphen (-), period (.), and space.}

\item{LogSubscription}{Enables or disables Amazon CloudWatch logging for the job. If logging is
enabled, CloudWatch writes one log stream for each job run.}

\item{MaxCapacity}{The maximum number of nodes that DataBrew can use when the job processes
data.}

\item{MaxRetries}{The maximum number of times to retry the job after a job run fails.}

\item{OutputLocation}{[required]}

\item{Configuration}{Configuration for profile jobs. Used to select columns, do evaluations,
and override default parameters of evaluations. When configuration is
null, the profile job will run with default settings.}

\item{ValidationConfigurations}{List of validation configurations that are applied to the profile job.}

\item{RoleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role to be assumed when DataBrew runs the job.}

\item{Tags}{Metadata tags to apply to this job.}

\item{Timeout}{The job's timeout in minutes. A job that attempts to run longer than
this timeout period ends with a status of \code{TIMEOUT}.}

\item{JobSample}{Sample configuration for profile jobs only. Determines the number of
rows on which the profile job will be executed. If a JobSample value is
not provided, the default value will be used. The default value is
CUSTOM_ROWS for the mode parameter and 20000 for the size parameter.}
