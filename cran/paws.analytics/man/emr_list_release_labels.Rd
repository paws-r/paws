\title{Retrieves release labels of EMR services in the region where the API is
called}
\usage{
emr_list_release_labels(Filters = NULL, NextToken = NULL, MaxResults = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Filters}{Filters the results of the request. \code{Prefix} specifies the prefix of
release labels to return. \code{Application} specifies the application
(with/without version) of release labels to return.}

\item{NextToken}{Specifies the next page of results. If \code{NextToken} is not specified,
which is usually the case for the first request of ListReleaseLabels,
the first page of results are determined by other filtering parameters
or by the latest version. The
\code{\link[=emr_list_release_labels]{list_release_labels}} request fails if the
identity (Amazon Web Services account ID) and all filtering parameters
are different from the original request, or if the \code{NextToken} is
expired or tampered with.}

\item{MaxResults}{Defines the maximum number of release labels to return in a single
response. The default is \code{100}.}
