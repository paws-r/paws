\description{
Gets a sortable, filterable list of existing Glue machine learning transforms. Machine learning transforms are a special type of transform that use machine learning to learn the details of the transformation to be performed by learning from examples provided by humans. These transformations are then saved by Glue, and you can retrieve their metadata by calling \code{\link[=glue_get_ml_transforms]{get_ml_transforms}}.

See \url{https://paws-r.github.io/docs/glue/get_ml_transforms.html} for full documentation.
