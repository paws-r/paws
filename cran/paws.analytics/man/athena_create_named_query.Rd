\title{Creates a named query in the specified workgroup}
\usage{
athena_create_named_query(Name, Description, Database, QueryString,
  ClientRequestToken, WorkGroup)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The query name.}

\item{Description}{The query description.}

\item{Database}{[required] The database to which the query belongs.}

\item{QueryString}{[required] The contents of the query with all query statements.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to create the
query is idempotent (executes only once). If another \code{CreateNamedQuery}
request is received, the same response is returned and another query is
not created. If a parameter has changed, for example, the \code{QueryString},
an error is returned.

This token is listed as not required because AWS SDKs (for example the
AWS SDK for Java) auto-generate the token for users. If you are not
using the AWS SDK or the AWS CLI, you must provide this token or the
action will fail.}

\item{WorkGroup}{The name of the workgroup in which the named query is being created.}
}
\description{
Creates a named query in the specified workgroup. Requires that you have
access to the workgroup.
}
