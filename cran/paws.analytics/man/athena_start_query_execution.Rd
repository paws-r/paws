\title{Runs the SQL query statements contained in the Query}
\usage{
athena_start_query_execution(
  QueryString,
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  QueryExecutionContext = NULL,
  ResultConfiguration = NULL,
  WorkGroup = NULL,
  ExecutionParameters = NULL,
  ResultReuseConfiguration = NULL,
  EngineConfiguration = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{QueryString}{[required] The SQL query statements to be executed.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to create the
query is idempotent (executes only once). If another
\code{\link[=athena_start_query_execution]{start_query_execution}} request is
received, the same response is returned and another query is not
created. An error is returned if a parameter, such as \code{QueryString}, has
changed. A call to
\code{\link[=athena_start_query_execution]{start_query_execution}} that uses a
previous client request token returns the same \code{QueryExecutionId} even
if the requester doesn't have permission on the tables specified in
\code{QueryString}.

This token is listed as not required because Amazon Web Services SDKs
(for example the Amazon Web Services SDK for Java) auto-generate the
token for users. If you are not using the Amazon Web Services SDK or the
Amazon Web Services CLI, you must provide this token or the action will
fail.}

\item{QueryExecutionContext}{The database within which the query executes.}

\item{ResultConfiguration}{Specifies information about where and how to save the results of the
query execution. If the query runs in a workgroup, then workgroup's
settings may override query settings. This affects the query results
location. The workgroup settings override is specified in
EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration (true/false) in the
WorkGroupConfiguration. See
WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration.}

\item{WorkGroup}{The name of the workgroup in which the query is being started.}

\item{ExecutionParameters}{A list of values for the parameters in a query. The values are applied
sequentially to the parameters in the query in the order in which the
parameters occur.}

\item{ResultReuseConfiguration}{Specifies the query result reuse behavior for the query.}

\item{EngineConfiguration}{}
}
\description{
Runs the SQL query statements contained in the \code{Query}. Requires you to have access to the workgroup in which the query ran. Running queries against an external catalog requires \code{\link[=athena_get_data_catalog]{get_data_catalog}} permission to the catalog. For code samples using the Amazon Web Services SDK for Java, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/code-samples.html}{Examples and Code Samples} in the \emph{Amazon Athena User Guide}.
