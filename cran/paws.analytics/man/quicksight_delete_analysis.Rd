\item{RecoveryWindowInDays}{A value that specifies the number of days that Amazon QuickSight waits

\description{
Deletes an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the analysis. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a \code{DeletionTime} stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.
