\description{
Deletes the entire schema set, including the schema set and all of its versions. To get the status of the delete operation, you can call \code{\link[=glue_get_schema]{get_schema}} API after the asynchronous call. Deleting a registry will deactivate all online operations for the schema, such as the \code{\link[=glue_get_schema_by_definition]{get_schema_by_definition}}, and \code{\link[=glue_register_schema_version]{register_schema_version}} APIs.

See \url{https://paws-r.github.io/docs/glue/delete_schema.html} for full documentation.
