\description{
To get the description of a registered consumer, provide the ARN of the
consumer. Alternatively, you can provide the ARN of the data stream and
the name you gave the consumer when you registered it. You may also
provide all three parameters, as long as they don\'t conflict with each
other. If you don\'t know the name or ARN of the consumer that you want
to describe, you can use the ListStreamConsumers operation to get a list
of the descriptions of all the consumers that are currently registered
with a given data stream.
}
\details{
This operation has a limit of 20 transactions per second per account.
