protocol for a stage}
\usage{
ivsrealtime_create_ingest_configuration(
  name = NULL,
  stageArn = NULL,
  userId = NULL,
  attributes = NULL,
  ingestProtocol,
  insecureIngest = NULL,
  tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Optional name that can be specified for the IngestConfiguration being
created.}

\item{stageArn}{ARN of the stage with which the IngestConfiguration is associated.}

\item{userId}{Customer-assigned name to help identify the participant using the
IngestConfiguration; this can be used to link a participant to a user in
the customerâ€™s own systems. This can be any UTF-8 encoded text. \emph{This
field is exposed to all stage participants and should not be used for
personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information.}}

\item{attributes}{Application-provided attributes to store in the IngestConfiguration and
attach to a stage. Map keys and values can contain UTF-8 encoded text.
The maximum length of this field is 1 KB total. \emph{This field is exposed
to all stage participants and should not be used for personally
identifying, confidential, or sensitive information.}}

\item{ingestProtocol}{[required] Type of ingest protocol that the user employs to broadcast. If this is
set to \code{RTMP}, \code{insecureIngest} must be set to \code{true}.}

\item{insecureIngest}{Whether the stage allows insecure RTMP ingest. This must be set to
\code{true}, if \code{ingestProtocol} is set to \code{RTMP}. Default: \code{false}.}

\item{tags}{Tags attached to the resource. Array of maps, each of the form
\code{string:string (key:value)}. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/best-practices-and-strats.html}{Best practices and strategies}
in \emph{Tagging AWS Resources and Tag Editor} for details, including
restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and
requirements"; Amazon IVS has no constraints on tags beyond what is
documented there.}
