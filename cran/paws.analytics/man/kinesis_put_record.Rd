\title{Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream}
\usage{
kinesis_put_record(
  StreamName,
  Data,
  PartitionKey,
  ExplicitHashKey = NULL,
  SequenceNumberForOrdering = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{StreamName}{[required] The name of the stream to put the data record into.}

\item{Data}{[required] The data blob to put into the record, which is base64-encoded when the
blob is serialized. When the data blob (the payload before
base64-encoding) is added to the partition key size, the total size must
not exceed the maximum record size (1 MiB).}

\item{PartitionKey}{[required] Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to.
Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256
characters for each key. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams uses the partition
key as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and
associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash function
is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map
associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing
mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same
shard within the stream.}

\item{ExplicitHashKey}{The hash value used to explicitly determine the shard the data record is
assigned to by overriding the partition key hash.}

\item{SequenceNumberForOrdering}{Guarantees strictly increasing sequence numbers, for puts from the same
client and to the same partition key. Usage: set the
\code{SequenceNumberForOrdering} of record \emph{n} to the sequence number of
record \emph{n-1} (as returned in the result when putting record \emph{n-1}). If
this parameter is not set, records are coarsely ordered based on arrival
time.}

\description{
Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Call \code{\link[=kinesis_put_record]{put_record}} to send data into the stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second.
