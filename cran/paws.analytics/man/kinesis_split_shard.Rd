\title{Splits a shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to
increase the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data}
\usage{
kinesis_split_shard(StreamName, ShardToSplit, NewStartingHashKey)
}
\arguments{
\item{StreamName}{[required] The name of the stream for the shard split.}

\item{ShardToSplit}{[required] The shard ID of the shard to split.}

\item{NewStartingHashKey}{[required] A hash key value for the starting hash key of one of the child shards
created by the split. The hash key range for a given shard constitutes a
set of ordered contiguous positive integers. The value for
\code{NewStartingHashKey} must be in the range of hash keys being mapped into
the shard. The \code{NewStartingHashKey} hash key value and all higher hash
key values in hash key range are distributed to one of the child shards.
All the lower hash key values in the range are distributed to the other
child shard.}
}
\description{
Splits a shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to
increase the stream\'s capacity to ingest and transport data.
\code{SplitShard} is called when there is a need to increase the overall
capacity of a stream because of an expected increase in the volume of
data records being ingested.
}
\details{
You can also use \code{SplitShard} when a shard appears to be approaching its
maximum utilization; for example, the producers sending data into the
specific shard are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated.
You can also call \code{SplitShard} to increase stream capacity, so that more
Kinesis Data Streams applications can simultaneously read data from the
stream for real-time processing.

You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is
the position in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many
cases, the new hash key might be the average of the beginning and ending
hash key, but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped
into the shard. For more information, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-split.html}{Split a Shard}
in the \emph{Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide}.

You can use DescribeStream to determine the shard ID and hash key values
for the \code{ShardToSplit} and \code{NewStartingHashKey} parameters that are
specified in the \code{SplitShard} request.

\code{SplitShard} is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a \code{SplitShard}
request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets
the stream status to \code{UPDATING}. After the operation is completed,
Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to \code{ACTIVE}. Read and write
operations continue to work while the stream is in the \code{UPDATING} state.

You can use \code{DescribeStream} to check the status of the stream, which is
returned in \code{StreamStatus}. If the stream is in the \code{ACTIVE} state, you
can call \code{SplitShard}. If a stream is in \code{CREATING} or \code{UPDATING} or
\code{DELETING} states, \code{DescribeStream} returns a \code{ResourceInUseException}.

If the specified stream does not exist, \code{DescribeStream} returns a
\code{ResourceNotFoundException}. If you try to create more shards than are
authorized for your account, you receive a \code{LimitExceededException}.

For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html}{Kinesis Data Streams Limits}
in the \emph{Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide}. To increase this
limit, \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html}{contact AWS Support}.

If you try to operate on too many streams simultaneously using
CreateStream, DeleteStream, MergeShards, and/or SplitShard, you receive
a \code{LimitExceededException}.

\code{SplitShard} has a limit of five transactions per second per account.
