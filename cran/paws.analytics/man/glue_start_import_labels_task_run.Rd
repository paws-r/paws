\usage{
glue_start_import_labels_task_run(TransformId, InputS3Path,
  ReplaceAllLabels)
}
\arguments{
\item{TransformId}{[required] The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.}

\item{InputS3Path}{[required] The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path from where you import
the labels.}

\item{ReplaceAllLabels}{Indicates whether to overwrite your existing labels.}
}
\description{
Enables you to provide additional labels (examples of truth) to be used
to teach the machine learning transform and improve its quality. This
API operation is generally used as part of the active learning workflow
that starts with the \code{StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun} call and that
ultimately results in improving the quality of your machine learning
transform.
}
\details{
After the \code{StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun} finishes, AWS Glue
machine learning will have generated a series of questions for humans to
answer. (Answering these questions is often called \'labeling\' in the
machine learning workflows). In the case of the \code{FindMatches} transform,
these questions are of the form, "What is the correct way to group these
rows together into groups composed entirely of matching records?" After
the labeling process is finished, users upload their answers/labels with
a call to \code{StartImportLabelsTaskRun}. After \code{StartImportLabelsTaskRun}
finishes, all future runs of the machine learning transform use the new
and improved labels and perform a higher-quality transformation.

By default, \code{StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun} continually learns
from and combines all labels that you upload unless you set \code{Replace} to
true. If you set \code{Replace} to true, \code{StartImportLabelsTaskRun} deletes
and forgets all previously uploaded labels and learns only from the
exact set that you upload. Replacing labels can be helpful if you
realize that you previously uploaded incorrect labels, and you believe
that they are having a negative effect on your transform quality.

You can check on the status of your task run by calling the
\code{GetMLTaskRun} operation.
