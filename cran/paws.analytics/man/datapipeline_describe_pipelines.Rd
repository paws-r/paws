\usage{
datapipeline_describe_pipelines(pipelineIds)
}
\arguments{
\item{pipelineIds}{[required] The IDs of the pipelines to describe. You can pass as many as 25
identifiers in a single call. To obtain pipeline IDs, call
\code{\link[=datapipeline_list_pipelines]{list_pipelines}}.}
}
\description{
Retrieves metadata about one or more pipelines. The information
retrieved includes the name of the pipeline, the pipeline identifier,
its current state, and the user account that owns the pipeline. Using
account credentials, you can retrieve metadata about pipelines that you
or your IAM users have created. If you are using an IAM user account,
you can retrieve metadata about only those pipelines for which you have
read permissions.

To retrieve the full pipeline definition instead of metadata about the
pipeline, call
\code{\link[=datapipeline_get_pipeline_definition]{get_pipeline_definition}}.
