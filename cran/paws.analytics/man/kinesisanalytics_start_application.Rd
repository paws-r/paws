\details{
Starts the specified Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. After
creating an application, you must exclusively call this operation to
start your application.

After the application starts, it begins consuming the input data,
processes it, and writes the output to the configured destination.

The application status must be \code{READY} for you to start an application.
You can get the application status in the console or using the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_DescribeApplication.html}{DescribeApplication}
operation.

After you start the application, you can stop the application from
processing the input by calling the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_StopApplication.html}{StopApplication}
operation.

This operation requires permissions to perform the
\code{kinesisanalytics:StartApplication} action.
