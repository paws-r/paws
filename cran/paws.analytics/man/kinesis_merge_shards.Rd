\title{Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them
into a single shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and
transport data}
\usage{
kinesis_merge_shards(StreamName, ShardToMerge, AdjacentShardToMerge)
}
\arguments{
\item{StreamName}{[required] The name of the stream for the merge.}

\item{ShardToMerge}{[required] The shard ID of the shard to combine with the adjacent shard for the
merge.}

\item{AdjacentShardToMerge}{[required] The shard ID of the adjacent shard for the merge.}
}
\description{
Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key range of 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent shards.
