\details{
Stops the application from processing input data. You can stop an
application only if it is in the running state. You can use the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_DescribeApplication.html}{DescribeApplication}
operation to find the application state. After the application is
stopped, Amazon Kinesis Analytics stops reading data from the input, the
application stops processing data, and there is no output written to the
destination.

This operation requires permissions to perform the
\code{kinesisanalytics:StopApplication} action.
