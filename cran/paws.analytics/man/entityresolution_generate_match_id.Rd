\title{Generates or retrieves Match IDs for records using a rule-based matching
workflow}
\usage{
entityresolution_generate_match_id(
  workflowName,
  records,
  processingType = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{workflowName}{[required] The name of the rule-based matching workflow.}

\item{records}{[required] The records to match.}

\item{processingType}{The processing mode that determines how Match IDs are generated and
results are saved. Each mode provides different levels of accuracy,
response time, and completeness of results.

If not specified, defaults to \code{CONSISTENT}.

\code{CONSISTENT}: Performs immediate lookup and matching against all
existing records, with results saved synchronously. Provides highest
accuracy but slower response time.

\code{EVENTUAL} (shown as \emph{Background} in the console): Performs initial
match ID lookup or generation immediately, with record updates processed
asynchronously in the background. Offers faster initial response time,
with complete matching results available later in S3.

\code{EVENTUAL_NO_LOOKUP} (shown as \emph{Quick ID generation} in the console):
Generates new match IDs without checking existing matches, with updates
processed asynchronously. Provides fastest response time but should only
be used for records known to be unique.}
}
\description{
Generates or retrieves Match IDs for records using a rule-based matching workflow. When you call this operation, it processes your records against the workflow's matching rules to identify potential matches. For existing records, it retrieves their Match IDs and associated rules. For records without matches, it generates new Match IDs. The operation saves results to Amazon S3.
