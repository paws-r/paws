\title{SetTerminationProtection locks a cluster (job flow) so the EC2 instances
in the cluster cannot be terminated by user intervention, an API call,
or in the event of a job-flow error}
\usage{
emr_set_termination_protection(JobFlowIds, TerminationProtected)
}
\arguments{
\item{JobFlowIds}{[required] A list of strings that uniquely identify the clusters to protect. This
identifier is returned by \code{\link[=emr_run_job_flow]{run_job_flow}} and can
also be obtained from \code{\link[=emr_describe_job_flows]{describe_job_flows}} .}

\item{TerminationProtected}{[required] A Boolean that indicates whether to protect the cluster and prevent the
Amazon EC2 instances in the cluster from shutting down due to API calls,
user intervention, or job-flow error.}
}
\description{
SetTerminationProtection locks a cluster (job flow) so the EC2 instances in the cluster cannot be terminated by user intervention, an API call, or in the event of a job-flow error. The cluster still terminates upon successful completion of the job flow. Calling \code{\link[=emr_set_termination_protection]{set_termination_protection}} on a cluster is similar to calling the Amazon EC2 \code{DisableAPITermination} API on all EC2 instances in a cluster.
