\title{Generates a session URL and authorization code that you can use to embed
an Amazon QuickSight read-only dashboard in your web server code}
\usage{
quicksight_get_dashboard_embed_url(AwsAccountId, DashboardId,
  IdentityType, SessionLifetimeInMinutes, UndoRedoDisabled, ResetDisabled,
  StatePersistenceEnabled, UserArn, Namespace, AdditionalDashboardIds)
}
\arguments{
\item{AwsAccountId}{[required] The ID for the AWS account that contains the dashboard that you're
embedding.}

\item{DashboardId}{[required] The ID for the dashboard, also added to the AWS Identity and Access
Management (IAM) policy.}

\item{IdentityType}{[required] The authentication method that the user uses to sign in.}

\item{SessionLifetimeInMinutes}{How many minutes the session is valid. The session lifetime must be
15-600 minutes.}

\item{UndoRedoDisabled}{Remove the undo/redo button on the embedded dashboard. The default is
FALSE, which enables the undo/redo button.}

\item{ResetDisabled}{Remove the reset button on the embedded dashboard. The default is FALSE,
which enables the reset button.}

\item{StatePersistenceEnabled}{Adds persistence of state for the user session in an embedded dashboard.
Persistence applies to the sheet and the parameter settings. These are
control settings that the dashboard subscriber (QuickSight reader)
chooses while viewing the dashboard. If this is set to \code{TRUE}, the
settings are the same when the subscriber reopens the same dashboard
URL. The state is stored in QuickSight, not in a browser cookie. If this
is set to FALSE, the state of the user session is not persisted. The
default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{UserArn}{The Amazon QuickSight user's Amazon Resource Name (ARN), for use with
\code{QUICKSIGHT} identity type. You can use this for any Amazon QuickSight
users in your account (readers, authors, or admins) authenticated as one
of the following:
\itemize{
\item Active Directory (AD) users or group members
\item Invited nonfederated users
\item IAM users and IAM role-based sessions authenticated through
Federated Single Sign-On using SAML, OpenID Connect, or IAM
federation.
}

Omit this parameter for users in the third group â€“ IAM users and IAM
role-based sessions.}

\item{Namespace}{The QuickSight namespace that contains the dashboard IDs in this
request. If you're not using a custom namespace, set this to
"\code{default}".}

\item{AdditionalDashboardIds}{A list of one or more dashboard IDs that you want to add to a session
that includes anonymous users. The \code{IdentityType} parameter must be set
to \code{ANONYMOUS} for this to work, because other identity types
authenticate as QuickSight or IAM users. For example, if you set
"\verb{--dashboard-id dash_id1 --dashboard-id dash_id2 dash_id3 identity-type ANONYMOUS}",
the session can access all three dashboards.}
}
\description{
Generates a session URL and authorization code that you can use to embed
an Amazon QuickSight read-only dashboard in your web server code. Before
you use this command, make sure that you have configured the dashboards
and permissions.

Currently, you can use \code{GetDashboardEmbedURL} only from the server, not
from the user's browser. The following rules apply to the combination of
URL and authorization code:
\itemize{
\item They must be used together.
\item They can be used one time only.
\item They are valid for 5 minutes after you run this command.
\item The resulting user session is valid for 10 hours.
}
