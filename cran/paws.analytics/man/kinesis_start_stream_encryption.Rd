\title{Enables or updates server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a
specified stream}
\usage{
kinesis_start_stream_encryption(StreamName, EncryptionType, KeyId)
}
\arguments{
\item{StreamName}{[required] The name of the stream for which to start encrypting records.}

\item{EncryptionType}{[required] The encryption type to use. The only valid value is \code{KMS}.}

\item{KeyId}{[required] The GUID for the customer-managed AWS KMS key to use for encryption.
This value can be a globally unique identifier, a fully specified Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) to either an alias or a key, or an alias name
prefixed by \"alias/\".You can also use a master key owned by Kinesis
Data Streams by specifying the alias \code{aws/kinesis}.
\itemize{
\item Key ARN example:
\code{arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012}
\item Alias ARN example:
\code{arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName}
\item Globally unique key ID example:
\code{12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012}
\item Alias name example: \code{alias/MyAliasName}
\item Master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams: \code{alias/aws/kinesis}
}}

\description{
Enables or updates server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a
specified stream.
}
\details{
Starting encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the
request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of
the stream to \code{UPDATING}. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data
Streams sets the status of the stream back to \code{ACTIVE}. Updating or
applying encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete, but it can
take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream
while its status is \code{UPDATING}. Once the status of the stream is
\code{ACTIVE}, encryption begins for records written to the stream.

API Limits: You can successfully apply a new AWS KMS key for server-side
encryption 25 times in a rolling 24-hour period.

Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an \code{ACTIVE}
status before all records written to the stream are encrypted. After you
enable encryption, you can verify that encryption is applied by
inspecting the API response from \code{PutRecord} or \code{PutRecords}.
