}
\arguments{
\item{StreamARN}{[required] The ARN of the Kinesis data stream that you want to register the
consumer with. For more info, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-kinesis-streams}{Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces}.}

\description{
Registers a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this
operation, the consumer you register can read data from the stream at a
rate of up to 2 MiB per second. This rate is unaffected by the total
number of consumers that read from the same stream.
}
\details{
You can register up to 5 consumers per stream. A given consumer can only
be registered with one stream.

This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account.
