\title{Provides a list of steps for the cluster in reverse order unless you
specify stepIds with the request or filter by StepStates}
\usage{
emr_list_steps(ClusterId, StepStates = NULL, StepIds = NULL, Marker = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ClusterId}{[required] The identifier of the cluster for which to list the steps.}

\item{StepStates}{The filter to limit the step list based on certain states.}

\item{StepIds}{The filter to limit the step list based on the identifier of the steps.
You can specify a maximum of ten Step IDs. The character constraint
applies to the overall length of the array.}

\item{Marker}{The maximum number of steps that a single \code{\link[=emr_list_steps]{list_steps}}
action returns is 50. To return a longer list of steps, use multiple
\code{\link[=emr_list_steps]{list_steps}} actions along with the \code{Marker}
parameter, which is a pagination token that indicates the next set of
results to retrieve.}

\description{
Provides a list of steps for the cluster in reverse order unless you specify \code{stepIds} with the request or filter by \code{StepStates}. You can specify a maximum of 10 \code{stepIDs}. The CLI automatically paginates results to return a list greater than 50 steps. To return more than 50 steps using the CLI, specify a \code{Marker}, which is a pagination token that indicates the next set of steps to retrieve.
