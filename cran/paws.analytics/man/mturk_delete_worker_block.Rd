The \code{DeleteWorkerBlock} operation allows you to reinstate a blocked
Worker to work on your HITs. This operation reverses the effects of the
CreateWorkerBlock operation. You need the Worker ID to use this
operation. If the Worker ID is missing or invalid, this operation fails
and returns the message "WorkerId is invalid." If the specified Worker
is not blocked, this operation returns successfully.
