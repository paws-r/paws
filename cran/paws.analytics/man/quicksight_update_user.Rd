\usage{
quicksight_update_user(
  UserName,
  AwsAccountId,
  Namespace,
  Email,
  Role,
  CustomPermissionsName = NULL,
  UnapplyCustomPermissions = NULL,
  ExternalLoginFederationProviderType = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{UserName}{[required] The Amazon QuickSight user name that you want to update.}

\item{AwsAccountId}{[required] The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that the user is in.
Currently, you use the ID for the Amazon Web Services account that
contains your Amazon QuickSight account.}

\item{Namespace}{[required] The namespace. Currently, you should set this to \code{default}.}

\item{Email}{[required] The email address of the user that you want to update.}

\item{Role}{[required] The Amazon QuickSight role of the user. The role can be one of the
following default security cohorts:
\itemize{
\item \code{READER}: A user who has read-only access to dashboards.
\item \code{AUTHOR}: A user who can create data sources, datasets, analyses,
and dashboards.
\item \code{ADMIN}: A user who is an author, who can also manage Amazon
QuickSight settings.
}

The name of the Amazon QuickSight role is invisible to the user except
for the console screens dealing with permissions.}

\item{CustomPermissionsName}{(Enterprise edition only) The name of the custom permissions profile
that you want to assign to this user. Customized permissions allows you
to control a user's access by restricting access the following
operations:
\itemize{
\item Create and update data sources
\item Create and update datasets
\item Create and update email reports
\item Subscribe to email reports
}

A set of custom permissions includes any combination of these
restrictions. Currently, you need to create the profile names for custom
permission sets by using the Amazon QuickSight console. Then, you use
the \code{\link[=quicksight_register_user]{register_user}} API operation to assign
the named set of permissions to a Amazon QuickSight user.

Amazon QuickSight custom permissions are applied through IAM policies.
Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted by assigning
Amazon QuickSight users to one of the default security cohorts in Amazon
QuickSight (admin, author, reader).

This feature is available only to Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edition
subscriptions.}

\item{UnapplyCustomPermissions}{A flag that you use to indicate that you want to remove all custom
permissions from this user. Using this parameter resets the user to the
state it was in before a custom permissions profile was applied. This
parameter defaults to NULL and it doesn't accept any other value.}

\item{ExternalLoginFederationProviderType}{The type of supported external login provider that provides identity to
let a user federate into Amazon QuickSight with an associated Identity
and Access Management(IAM) role. The type of supported external login
provider can be one of the following.
\itemize{
\item \code{COGNITO}: Amazon Cognito. The provider URL is
cognito-identity.amazonaws.com. When choosing the \code{COGNITO} provider
type, donâ€™t use the "CustomFederationProviderUrl" parameter which is
only needed when the external provider is custom.
\item \code{CUSTOM_OIDC}: Custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. When choosing
\code{CUSTOM_OIDC} type, use the \code{CustomFederationProviderUrl} parameter
to provide the custom OIDC provider URL.
\item \code{NONE}: This clears all the previously saved external login
information for a user. Use the
\code{\link[=quicksight_describe_user]{describe_user}} API operation to check
the external login information.
}}

\item{CustomFederationProviderUrl}{The URL of the custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that provides
identity to let a user federate into Amazon QuickSight with an
associated Identity and Access Management(IAM) role. This parameter
should only be used when \code{ExternalLoginFederationProviderType} parameter
is set to \code{CUSTOM_OIDC}.}

\item{ExternalLoginId}{The identity ID for a user in the external login provider.}
