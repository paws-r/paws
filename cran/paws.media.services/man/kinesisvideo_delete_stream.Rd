Deletes a Kinesis video stream and the data contained in the stream.
}
\details{
This method marks the stream for deletion, and makes the data in the
stream inaccessible immediately.

To ensure that you have the latest version of the stream before deleting
it, you can specify the stream version. Kinesis Video Streams assigns a
version to each stream. When you update a stream, Kinesis Video Streams
assigns a new version number. To get the latest stream version, use the
\code{DescribeStream} API.

This operation requires permission for the \code{KinesisVideo:DeleteStream}
action.
