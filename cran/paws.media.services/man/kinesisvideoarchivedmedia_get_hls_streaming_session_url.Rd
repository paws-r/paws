\title{Retrieves an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) URL for the stream}
\usage{
kinesisvideoarchivedmedia_get_hls_streaming_session_url(StreamName,
  StreamARN, PlaybackMode, HLSFragmentSelector, ContainerFormat,
  DiscontinuityMode, DisplayFragmentTimestamp, Expires,
  MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults)
}
\arguments{
\item{StreamName}{The name of the stream for which to retrieve the HLS master playlist
URL.

You must specify either the \code{StreamName} or the \code{StreamARN}.}

\item{StreamARN}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which to retrieve the
HLS master playlist URL.

You must specify either the \code{StreamName} or the \code{StreamARN}.}

\item{PlaybackMode}{Whether to retrieve live, live replay, or archived, on-demand data.

Features of the three types of sessions include the following:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{LIVE}} : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is
continually updated with the latest fragments as they become
available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new
playlist on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
\"live\" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
position in the playback window to display.

In \code{LIVE} mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
HLS media playlist, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
are not added to the HLS media playlist if they are older than the
newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
available after a subsequent fragment is added to the playlist, the
older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
\item \strong{\code{LIVE_REPLAY}} : For sessions of this type, the HLS media
playlist is updated similarly to how it is updated for \code{LIVE} mode
except that it starts by including fragments from a given start
time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested,
fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses.
For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long,
then a new fragment is added to the media playlist every two
seconds. This mode is useful to be able to start playback from when
an event is detected and continue live streaming media that has not
yet been ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode
is also useful to stream previously archived media without being
limited by the 1,000 fragment limit in the \code{ON_DEMAND} mode.
\item \strong{\code{ON_DEMAND}} : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist
contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is
specified in \code{MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults}. The playlist must be
retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to
display.
}

In all playback modes, if \code{FragmentSelectorType} is
\code{PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP}, and if there are multiple fragments with the same
start timestamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that
is, the newer fragment) is included in the HLS media playlist. The other
fragments are not included. Fragments that have different timestamps but
have overlapping durations are still included in the HLS media playlist.
This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.

The default is \code{LIVE}.}

\item{HLSFragmentSelector}{The time range of the requested fragment and the source of the
timestamps.

This parameter is required if \code{PlaybackMode} is \code{ON_DEMAND} or
\code{LIVE_REPLAY}. This parameter is optional if PlaybackMode is`` \code{LIVE}.
If `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, the `FragmentSelectorType` can be set, but
the `TimestampRange` should not be set. If `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`
or `LIVE_REPLAY`, both `FragmentSelectorType` and `TimestampRange` must
be set.}

\item{ContainerFormat}{Specifies which format should be used for packaging the media.
Specifying the \code{FRAGMENTED_MP4} container format packages the media into
MP4 fragments (fMP4 or CMAF). This is the recommended packaging because
there is minimal packaging overhead. The other container format option
is \code{MPEG_TS}. HLS has supported MPEG TS chunks since it was released and
is sometimes the only supported packaging on older HLS players. MPEG TS
typically has a 5-25 percent packaging overhead. This means MPEG TS
typically requires 5-25 percent more bandwidth and cost than fMP4.

The default is \code{FRAGMENTED_MP4}.}

\item{DiscontinuityMode}{Specifies when flags marking discontinuities between fragments are added
to the media playlists.

Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based
on the timestamps of each fragment. This means that if there is any
overlap or gap between fragments (as is typical if HLSFragmentSelector
is set to \code{SERVER_TIMESTAMP}), the media player timeline will also have
small gaps between fragments in some places, and will overwrite frames
in other places. Gaps in the media player timeline can cause playback to
stall and overlaps can cause playback to be jittery. When there are
discontinuity flags between fragments, the media player is expected to
reset the timeline, resulting in the next fragment being played
immediately after the previous fragment.

The following modes are supported:
\itemize{
\item \code{ALWAYS}: a discontinuity marker is placed between every fragment in
the HLS media playlist. It is recommended to use a value of \code{ALWAYS}
if the fragment timestamps are not accurate.
\item \code{NEVER}: no discontinuity markers are placed anywhere. It is
recommended to use a value of \code{NEVER} to ensure the media player
timeline most accurately maps to the producer timestamps.
\item \code{ON_DISCONTIUNITY}: a discontinuity marker is placed between
fragments that have a gap or overlap of more than 50 milliseconds.
For most playback scenarios, it is recommended to use a value of
\code{ON_DISCONTINUITY} so that the media player timeline is only reset
when there is a significant issue with the media timeline (e.g. a
missing fragment).
}

The default is \code{ALWAYS} when HLSFragmentSelector is set to
\code{SERVER_TIMESTAMP}, and \code{NEVER} when it is set to \code{PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP}.}

\item{DisplayFragmentTimestamp}{Specifies when the fragment start timestamps should be included in the
HLS media playlist. Typically, media players report the playhead
position as a time relative to the start of the first fragment in the
playback session. However, when the start timestamps are included in the
HLS media playlist, some media players might report the current playhead
as an absolute time based on the fragment timestamps. This can be useful
for creating a playback experience that shows viewers the wall-clock
time of the media.

The default is \code{NEVER}. When HLSFragmentSelector is \code{SERVER_TIMESTAMP},
the timestamps will be the server start timestamps. Similarly, when
HLSFragmentSelector is \code{PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP}, the timestamps will be the
producer start timestamps.}

\item{Expires}{The time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value can
be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).

When a session expires, no new calls to \code{GetHLSMasterPlaylist},
\code{GetHLSMediaPlaylist}, \code{GetMP4InitFragment}, \code{GetMP4MediaFragment}, or
\code{GetTSFragment} can be made for that session.

The default is 300 (5 minutes).}

\item{MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults}{The maximum number of fragments that are returned in the HLS media
playlists.

When the \code{PlaybackMode} is \code{LIVE}, the most recent fragments are
returned up to this value. When the \code{PlaybackMode} is \code{ON_DEMAND}, the
oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.

When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live HLS
media playlist, video players often buffer content before starting
playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but
it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback.
We recommend that a live HLS media playlist have a minimum of 3
fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.

The default is 5 fragments if \code{PlaybackMode} is \code{LIVE} or \code{LIVE_REPLAY},
and 1,000 if \code{PlaybackMode} is \code{ON_DEMAND}.

The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16 minutes
of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2 1/2 hours
of video on streams with 10-second fragments.}

\description{
Retrieves an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) URL for the stream. You can then
open the URL in a browser or media player to view the stream contents.
}
\details{
Both the \code{StreamName} and the \code{StreamARN} parameters are optional, but
you must specify either the \code{StreamName} or the \code{StreamARN} when
invoking this API operation.

An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
providing data through HLS:
\itemize{
\item The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and, optionally,
AAC encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1 should be
\code{V_MPEG/ISO/AVC} (for h.264) or \code{V_MPEG/ISO/HEVC} (for h.265).
Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be \code{A_AAC}.
\item Data retention must be greater than 0.
\item The video track of each fragment must contain codec private data in
the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format or HEVC for H.265
format (\href{https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html}{MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC 14496-15}). For information
about adapting stream data to a given format, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html}{NAL Adaptation Flags}.
\item The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec
private data in the AAC format (\href{https://www.iso.org/standard/43345.html}{AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7}).
}

Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the fragmented
MPEG-4 form (also called fMP4 or CMAF) or the MPEG-2 form (also called
TS chunks, which the HLS specification also supports). For more
information about HLS fragment types, see the \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23}{HLS specification}.

The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:
\enumerate{
\item Get an endpoint using
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html}{GetDataEndpoint},
specifying \code{GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL} for the \code{APIName}
parameter.
\item Retrieve the HLS URL using \code{GetHLSStreamingSessionURL}. Kinesis
Video Streams creates an HLS streaming session to be used for
accessing content in a stream using the HLS protocol.
\code{GetHLSStreamingSessionURL} returns an authenticated URL (that
includes an encrypted session token) for the session\'s HLS \emph{master
playlist} (the root resource needed for streaming with HLS).

Don\'t share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could
access it. The token provides access to the content of the stream.
Safeguard the token with the same measures that you would use with
your AWS credentials.

The media that is made available through the playlist consists only
of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data
(such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates)
is made available.
\item Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the HLS
master playlist to a media player that supports the HLS protocol.
Kinesis Video Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization
fragment, and media fragments available through the master playlist
URL. The initialization fragment contains the codec private data for
the stream, and other data needed to set up the video or audio
decoder and renderer. The media fragments contain H.264-encoded
video frames or AAC-encoded audio samples.
\item The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream
metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests
data, it calls the following actions:
\itemize{
\item \strong{GetHLSMasterPlaylist:} Retrieves an HLS master playlist,
which contains a URL for the \code{GetHLSMediaPlaylist} action for
each track, and additional metadata for the media player,
including estimated bitrate and resolution.
\item \strong{GetHLSMediaPlaylist:} Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which
contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with
the \code{GetMP4InitFragment} action, and URLs to access the MP4
media fragments with the \code{GetMP4MediaFragment} actions. The HLS
media playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the
player needs to play it, such as whether the \code{PlaybackMode} is
\code{LIVE} or \code{ON_DEMAND}. The HLS media playlist is typically
static for sessions with a \code{PlaybackType} of \code{ON_DEMAND}. The
HLS media playlist is continually updated with new fragments for
sessions with a \code{PlaybackType} of \code{LIVE}. There is a distinct
HLS media playlist for the video track and the audio track (if
applicable) that contains MP4 media URLs for the specific track.
\item \strong{GetMP4InitFragment:} Retrieves the MP4 initialization
fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization
fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment
contains the \"\code{fytp}\" and \"\code{moov}\" MP4 atoms, and the child
atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.

The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in
a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data
for the stream and respective track, which the media player
needs to decode the media frames.
\item \strong{GetMP4MediaFragment:} Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
fragments contain the \"\code{moof}\" and \"\code{mdat}\" MP4 atoms and
their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment\'s media
frames and their timestamps.

After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming
session, any fragments that don\'t contain the same codec
private data cause an error to be returned when those different
media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec private data
should not change between fragments in a session. This also
means that the session fails if the fragments in a stream change
from having only video to having both audio and video.

Data retrieved with this action is billable. See
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/}{Pricing}
for details.
\item \strong{GetTSFragment:} Retrieves MPEG TS fragments containing both
initialization and media data for all tracks in the stream.

If the \code{ContainerFormat} is \code{MPEG_TS}, this API is used instead
of \code{GetMP4InitFragment} and \code{GetMP4MediaFragment} to retrieve
stream media.

Data retrieved with this action is billable. For more
information, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/}{Kinesis Video Streams pricing}.
}
}

The following restrictions apply to HLS sessions:
\itemize{
\item A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The
service might throttle a session if multiple media players are
sharing it. For connection limits, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html}{Kinesis Video Streams Limits}.
\item A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of ten active HLS
streaming sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum
number of sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created)
session is closed. The number of active \code{GetMedia} connections on a
Kinesis video stream does not count against this limit, and the
number of active HLS sessions does not count against the active
\code{GetMedia} connection limit.

The maximum limits for active HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming sessions
are independent of each other.
}

You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
monitoring the \code{GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes} Amazon CloudWatch
metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video
Streams, see \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/monitoring.html}{Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams}.
For pricing information, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/}{Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Pricing} and \href{https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/}{AWS Pricing}. Charges for both HLS sessions
and outgoing AWS data apply.

For more information about HLS, see \href{https://developer.apple.com/streaming/}{HTTP Live Streaming} on the \href{https://developer.apple.com}{Apple Developer site}.

If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived
media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it
includes the following pieces of information:
\itemize{
\item \code{x-amz-ErrorType} HTTP header -- contains a more specific error type
in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.
\item \code{x-amz-RequestId} HTTP header -- if you want to report an issue to
AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
Request Id.
}

Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to
make programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and
under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions
the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully try
again.

For more information, see the \strong{Errors} section at the bottom of this
topic, as well as \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/CommonErrors.html}{Common Errors}.
