#' @description
#' AWS Marketplace Metering Service
#' 
#' This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace
#' Metering Service API.
#' 
#' AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom
#' usage dimensions.
#' 
#' For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see [AWS
#' Marketplace metering and entitlement API
#' permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html)
#' in the *AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.*
#' 
#' **Submitting Metering Records**
#' 
#' -   *MeterUsage* - Submits the metering record for an AWS Marketplace
#'     product. [`meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_meter_usage] is called
#'     from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS or ECS.
#' 
#' -   *BatchMeterUsage* - Submits the metering record for a set of
#'     customers.
#'     [`batch_meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_batch_meter_usage] is
#'     called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.
#' 
#' **Accepting New Customers**
#' 
#' -   *ResolveCustomer* - Called by a SaaS application during the
#'     registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the
#'     registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through
#'     the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to
#'     obtain a `CustomerIdentifier` along with the `CustomerAWSAccountId`
#'     and `ProductCode`.
#' 
#' **Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products**
#' 
#' -   Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
#'     integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
#'     [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] operation for
#'     software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon
#'     ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call
#'     [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage], but you can
#'     do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For
#'     more information on using the
#'     [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] operation,
#'     see [Container-Based
#'     Products](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html).
#' 
#' [`batch_meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_batch_meter_usage] API calls
#' are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that
#' the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for
#' records with the `eventName` of
#' [`batch_meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_batch_meter_usage]. You can
#' also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information,
#' see the *\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html}{AWS CloudTrail User Guide}.*
