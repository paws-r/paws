#' @description
#' AWS Marketplace Metering Service
#' 
#' This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace
#' Metering Service API.
#' 
#' AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom
#' usage dimensions.
#' 
#' **Submitting Metering Records**
#' 
#' -   *MeterUsage*- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product.
#'     MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance.
#' 
#' -   *BatchMeterUsage*- Submits the metering record for a set of
#'     customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service
#'     (SaaS) application.
#' 
#' **Accepting New Customers**
#' 
#' -   *ResolveCustomer*- Called by a SaaS application during the
#'     registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the
#'     registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through
#'     the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to
#'     obtain a CustomerIdentifier and Product Code.
#' 
#' **Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products**
#' 
#' -   Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
#'     integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
#'     RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering.
#'     Calling RegisterUsage from containers running outside of Amazon
#'     Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECR) isn\'t supported. Free and
#'     BYOL products for ECS aren\'t required to call RegisterUsage, but
#'     you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller
#'     reports. For more information on using the RegisterUsage operation,
#'     see [Container-Based
#'     Products](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html).
#' 
#' BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use
#' Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are
#' accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage.
#' You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more
#' information, see the *[AWS CloudTrail User
#' Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html)*
#' .
#'
#' @param
#' config
#' An optional list of custom configurations for the service. Currently
#'            supports adding custom credentials, endpoint, and region.
#'
#' @section Service syntax:
#' ```
#' svc <- marketplacemetering(
#'   config = list(
#'     credentials = list(
#'       creds = list(
#'         access_key_id = "string",
#'         secret_access_key = "string",
#'         session_token = "string",
#'         provider_name = "string"
#'       ),
#'       profile = "string"
#'     ),
#'     endpoint = "string",
#'     region = "string"
#'   )
#' )
#' ```

#' svc$batch_meter_usage(
#'   Foo = 123
#' )}
