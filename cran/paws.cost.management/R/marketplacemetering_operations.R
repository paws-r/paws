#' API to emit metering records
#'
#' @description
#' API to emit metering records. For identical requests, the API is idempotent. It simply returns the metering record ID.
#'
#' See [https://paws-r.github.io/docs/marketplacemetering/meter_usage.html](https://paws-r.github.io/docs/marketplacemetering/meter_usage.html) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param ProductCode &#91;required&#93; Product code is used to uniquely identify a product in AWS Marketplace.
#' The product code should be the same as the one used during the
#' publishing of a new product.
#' @param Timestamp &#91;required&#93; Timestamp, in UTC, for which the usage is being reported. Your
#' application can meter usage for up to one hour in the past. Make sure
#' the `timestamp` value is not before the start of the software usage.
#' @param UsageDimension &#91;required&#93; It will be one of the fcp dimension name provided during the publishing
#' of the product.
#' @param UsageQuantity Consumption value for the hour. Defaults to `0` if not specified.
#' @param DryRun Checks whether you have the permissions required for the action, but
#' does not make the request. If you have the permissions, the request
#' returns `DryRunOperation`; otherwise, it returns
#' `UnauthorizedException`. Defaults to `false` if not specified.
#' @param UsageAllocations The set of `UsageAllocations` to submit.
#' 
#' The sum of all `UsageAllocation` quantities must equal the
#' `UsageQuantity` of the [`meter_usage`][marketplacemetering_meter_usage]
#' request, and each `UsageAllocation` must have a unique set of tags
#' (include no tags).

#' Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must

#'
#' @description
#' Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage], but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage]. [`register_usage`][marketplacemetering_register_usage] performs two primary functions: metering and entitlement.

#' @param Nonce (Optional) To scope down the registration to a specific running software
#' instance and guard against replay attacks.
