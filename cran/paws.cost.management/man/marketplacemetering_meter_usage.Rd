)
}
\arguments{
\item{ProductCode}{[required] Product code is used to uniquely identify a product in AWS Marketplace.
The product code should be the same as the one used during the
publishing of a new product.}

\item{Timestamp}{[required] Timestamp, in UTC, for which the usage is being reported. Your
application can meter usage for up to one hour in the past. Make sure
the \code{timestamp} value is not before the start of the software usage.}

\item{UsageDimension}{[required] It will be one of the fcp dimension name provided during the publishing
of the product.}

\item{UsageQuantity}{Consumption value for the hour. Defaults to \code{0} if not specified.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the permissions required for the action, but
does not make the request. If you have the permissions, the request
returns \code{DryRunOperation}; otherwise, it returns
\code{UnauthorizedException}. Defaults to \code{false} if not specified.}

\item{UsageAllocations}{The set of \code{UsageAllocations} to submit.

The sum of all \code{UsageAllocation} quantities must equal the
\code{UsageQuantity} of the \code{\link[=marketplacemetering_meter_usage]{meter_usage}}
request, and each \code{UsageAllocation} must have a unique set of tags
(include no tags).}
