\title{Retrieves all available filter values for a specified filter over a
period of time}
\usage{
costexplorer_get_dimension_values(
  SearchString = NULL,
  TimePeriod,
  Dimension,
  Context = NULL,
  Filter = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{SearchString}{The value that you want to search the filter values for.}

\item{TimePeriod}{[required] The start date and end date for retrieving the dimension values. The
start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if
\code{start} is \code{2017-01-01} and \code{end} is \code{2017-05-01}, then the cost and
usage data is retrieved from \code{2017-01-01} up to and including
\code{2017-04-30} but not including \code{2017-05-01}.}

\item{Dimension}{[required] The name of the dimension. Each \code{Dimension} is available for a different
\code{Context}. For more information, see \code{Context}.}

\item{Context}{The context for the call to
\code{\link[=costexplorer_get_dimension_values]{get_dimension_values}}. This can be
\code{RESERVATIONS} or \code{COST_AND_USAGE}. The default value is
\code{COST_AND_USAGE}. If the context is set to \code{RESERVATIONS}, the resulting
dimension values can be used in the
\code{\link[=costexplorer_get_reservation_utilization]{get_reservation_utilization}}
operation. If the context is set to \code{COST_AND_USAGE}, the resulting
dimension values can be used in the
\code{\link[=costexplorer_get_cost_and_usage]{get_cost_and_usage}} operation.

If you set the context to \code{COST_AND_USAGE}, you can use the following
dimensions for searching:
