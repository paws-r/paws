\arguments{
\item{TimePeriod}{[required] The time period that you want the usage and costs for. The \code{Start} date
must be within 13 months. The \code{End} date must be after the \code{Start} date,
and before the current date. Future dates can't be used as an \code{End}
date.}

\item{GroupBy}{You can group the data using the attributes \code{INSTANCE_FAMILY}, \code{REGION},
or \code{SERVICE}.}

\item{Granularity}{The granularity of the Amazon Web Services cost data for your Savings
Plans. \code{Granularity} can't be set if \code{GroupBy} is set.

The
\code{\link[=costexplorer_get_savings_plans_coverage]{get_savings_plans_coverage}}
operation supports only \code{DAILY} and \code{MONTHLY} granularities.}

\item{Filter}{Filters Savings Plans coverage data by dimensions. You can filter data
for Savings Plans usage with the following dimensions:
\itemize{
\item \code{LINKED_ACCOUNT}
\item \code{REGION}
\item \code{SERVICE}
\item \code{INSTANCE_FAMILY}
}

\code{\link[=costexplorer_get_savings_plans_coverage]{get_savings_plans_coverage}}

dimension. If there are multiple values for a dimension, they are OR'd
together.

Cost category is also supported.}

\item{Metrics}{The measurement that you want your Savings Plans coverage reported in.
The only valid value is \code{SpendCoveredBySavingsPlans}.}

\item{NextToken}{The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
provides the token when the response from a previous call has more
results than the maximum page size.}

\item{MaxResults}{The number of items to be returned in a response. The default is \code{20},
with a minimum value of \code{1}.}

\item{SortBy}{The value that you want to sort the data by.

The following values are supported for \code{Key}:
\itemize{
\item \code{SpendCoveredBySavingsPlan}
\item \code{OnDemandCost}
\item \code{CoveragePercentage}
\item \code{TotalCost}
\item \code{InstanceFamily}
\item \code{Region}
\item \code{Service}
