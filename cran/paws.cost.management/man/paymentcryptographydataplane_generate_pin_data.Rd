\title{Generates pin-related data such as PIN, PIN Verification Value (PVV),
PIN Block, and PIN Offset during new card issuance or reissuance}
\usage{
paymentcryptographydataplane_generate_pin_data(
  GenerationKeyIdentifier,
  EncryptionKeyIdentifier,
  GenerationAttributes,
  PinDataLength = NULL,
  PrimaryAccountNumber = NULL,
  PinBlockFormat,
  EncryptionWrappedKey = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{GenerationKeyIdentifier}{[required] The \code{keyARN} of the PEK that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
uses for pin data generation.}

\item{EncryptionKeyIdentifier}{[required] The \code{keyARN} of the PEK that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
uses to encrypt the PIN Block. For ECDH, it is the \code{keyARN} of the
asymmetric ECC key.}

\item{GenerationAttributes}{[required] The attributes and values to use for PIN, PVV, or PIN Offset generation.}

\item{PinDataLength}{The length of PIN under generation.}

\item{PrimaryAccountNumber}{The Primary Account Number (PAN), a unique identifier for a payment
credit or debit card that associates the card with a specific account
holder.}

\item{PinBlockFormat}{[required] The PIN encoding format for pin data generation as specified in ISO
9564. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports \code{ISO_Format_0},
\code{ISO_Format_3} and \code{ISO_Format_4}.

The \code{ISO_Format_0} PIN block format is equivalent to the ANSI X9.8,
VISA-1, and ECI-1 PIN block formats. It is similar to a VISA-4 PIN block
format. It supports a PIN from 4 to 12 digits in length.

The \code{ISO_Format_3} PIN block format is the same as \code{ISO_Format_0} except
that the fill digits are random values from 10 to 15.

The \code{ISO_Format_4} PIN block format is the only one supporting AES
encryption.}
