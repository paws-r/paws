#' AWS CodeBuild
#'
#' @description
#' AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS
#' CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces
#' artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to
#' provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides
#' prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming
#' languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You
#' can also fully customize build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use your
#' own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build
#' requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more
#' information about AWS CodeBuild, see the *AWS CodeBuild User Guide*.
#' 
#' AWS CodeBuild supports these operations:
#' 
#' -   `BatchDeleteBuilds`: Deletes one or more builds.
#' 
#' -   `BatchGetProjects`: Gets information about one or more build
#'     projects. A *build project* defines how AWS CodeBuild runs a build.
#'     This includes information such as where to get the source code to
#'     build, the build environment to use, the build commands to run, and
#'     where to store the build output. A *build environment* is a
#'     representation of operating system, programming language runtime,
#'     and tools that AWS CodeBuild uses to run a build. You can add tags
#'     to build projects to help manage your resources and costs.
#' 
#' -   `CreateProject`: Creates a build project.
#' 
#' -   `CreateWebhook`: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that
#'     has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository,
#'     enables AWS CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time
#'     a code change is pushed to the repository.
#' 
#' -   `UpdateWebhook`: Changes the settings of an existing webhook.
#' 
#' -   `DeleteProject`: Deletes a build project.
#' 
#' -   `DeleteWebhook`: For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that
#'     has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository,
#'     stops AWS CodeBuild from rebuilding the source code every time a
#'     code change is pushed to the repository.
#' 
#' -   `ListProjects`: Gets a list of build project names, with each build
#'     project name representing a single build project.
#' 
#' -   `UpdateProject`: Changes the settings of an existing build project.
#' 
#' -   `BatchGetBuilds`: Gets information about one or more builds.
#' 
#' -   `ListBuilds`: Gets a list of build IDs, with each build ID
#'     representing a single build.
#' 
#' -   `ListBuildsForProject`: Gets a list of build IDs for the specified
#'     build project, with each build ID representing a single build.
#' 
#' -   `StartBuild`: Starts running a build.
#' 
#' -   `StopBuild`: Attempts to stop running a build.
#' 
#' -   `ListCuratedEnvironmentImages`: Gets information about Docker images
#'     that are managed by AWS CodeBuild.
#' 
#' -   `DeleteSourceCredentials`: Deletes a set of GitHub, GitHub
#'     Enterprise, or Bitbucket source credentials.
#' 
#' -   `ImportSourceCredentials`: Imports the source repository credentials
#'     for an AWS CodeBuild project that has its source code stored in a
#'     GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket repository.
#' 
#' -   `ListSourceCredentials`: Returns a list of `SourceCredentialsInfo`
#'     objects. Each `SourceCredentialsInfo` object includes the
#'     authentication type, token ARN, and type of source provider for one
#'     set of credentials.
#'
#' @examples
#' # The following example gets information about builds with the specified
#' # build IDs.

#'   ids = list(
#'     "codebuild-demo-project:9b0ac37f-d19e-4254-9079-f47e9a389eEX",
