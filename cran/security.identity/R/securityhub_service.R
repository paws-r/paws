#' AWS Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security
#' state within AWS and your compliance with the security industry
#' standards and best practices. Security Hub collects security data from
#' across AWS accounts, services, and supported third-party partners and
#' helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority
#' security issues. For more information, see [AWS Security Hub User
