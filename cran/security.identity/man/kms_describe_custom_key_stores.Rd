\usage{
kms_describe_custom_key_stores(CustomKeyStoreId, CustomKeyStoreName,
  Limit, Marker)
}
\arguments{
\item{CustomKeyStoreId}{Gets only information about the specified custom key store. Enter the
key store ID.

By default, this operation gets information about all custom key stores
in the account and region. To limit the output to a particular custom
key store, you can use either the \code{CustomKeyStoreId} or
\code{CustomKeyStoreName} parameter, but not both.}

\item{CustomKeyStoreName}{Gets only information about the specified custom key store. Enter the
friendly name of the custom key store.

By default, this operation gets information about all custom key stores
in the account and region. To limit the output to a particular custom
key store, you can use either the \code{CustomKeyStoreId} or
\code{CustomKeyStoreName} parameter, but not both.}

\item{Limit}{Use this parameter to specify the maximum number of items to return.
When this value is present, AWS KMS does not return more than the
specified number of items, but it might return fewer.}

\item{Marker}{Use this parameter in a subsequent request after you receive a response
with truncated results. Set it to the value of \code{NextMarker} from the
truncated response you just received.}

\description{
Gets information about \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html}{custom key stores}
in the account and region.
}
\details{
This operation is part of the \href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html}{Custom Key Store feature}
feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive
integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant
key store.

By default, this operation returns information about all custom key
stores in the account and region. To get only information about a
particular custom key store, use either the \code{CustomKeyStoreName} or
\code{CustomKeyStoreId} parameter (but not both).

To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its AWS
CloudHSM cluster, use the \code{ConnectionState} element in the response. If
an attempt to connect the custom key store failed, the \code{ConnectionState}
value is \code{FAILED} and the \code{ConnectionErrorCode} element in the response
indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the
\code{ConnectionErrorCode}, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.

Custom key stores have a \code{DISCONNECTED} connection state if the key
store has never been connected or you use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore
operation to disconnect it. If your custom key store state is
\code{CONNECTED} but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its
associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the minimum
number of HSMs required for the operation, if any.

For help repairing your custom key store, see the Troubleshooting Custom
Key Stores topic in the \emph{AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide}.
