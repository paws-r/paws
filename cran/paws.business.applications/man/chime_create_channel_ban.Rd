\description{
Permanently bans a member from a channel. Moderators can't add banned
members to a channel. To undo a ban, you first have to
\code{\link[=chime_delete_channel_ban]{delete_channel_ban}}, and then
\code{\link[=chime_create_channel_membership]{create_channel_membership}}. Bans are
cleaned up when you delete users or channels.

If you ban a user who is already part of a channel, that user is
automatically kicked from the channel.
