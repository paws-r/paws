\description{
Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring
service with support for existing desktop and mobile email clients. You
can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook,
your browser, or other native iOS and Android email applications. You
can integrate WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and
control both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which
your data is stored.

The WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:
\itemize{
\item Listing and describing organizations
}<!-- -->

\itemize{
\item Managing users
}<!-- -->

\itemize{
\item Managing groups
}<!-- -->

\itemize{
\item Managing resources
}

All WorkMail API operations are Amazon-authenticated and
certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but
also allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management
users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the
WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into
the entire WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy). This
includes, but is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and
delete users, groups, and resources. This allows developers to perform
the scenarios listed above, as well as give users the ability to grant
access on a selective basis using the IAM model.
