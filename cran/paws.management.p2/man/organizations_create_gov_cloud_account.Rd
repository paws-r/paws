\title{This action is available if all of the following are true:}
\usage{
organizations_create_gov_cloud_account(
  Email,
  AccountName,
  RoleName = NULL,
  IamUserAccessToBilling = NULL,
  Tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Email}{[required] Specifies the email address of the owner to assign to the new member
account in the commercial Region. This email address must not already be
associated with another Amazon Web Services account. You must use a
valid email address to complete account creation.

The rules for a valid email address:
\itemize{
\item The address must be a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 64 characters
long.
\item All characters must be 7-bit ASCII characters.
\item There must be one and only one @ symbol, which separates the local
name from the domain name.
\item The local name can't contain any of the following characters:

whitespace, " ' ( ) \< \> [ ] : ; , \\ | \% &
\item The local name can't begin with a dot (.)
\item The domain name can consist of only the characters
[a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.)
\item The domain name can't begin or end with a hyphen (-) or dot (.)
\item The domain name must contain at least one dot
}

You can't access the root user of the account or remove an account that
was created with an invalid email address. Like all request parameters
for
\code{\link[=organizations_create_gov_cloud_account]{create_gov_cloud_account}},
the request for the email address for the Amazon Web Services GovCloud
(US) account originates from the commercial Region, not from the Amazon
Web Services GovCloud (US) Region.}

\item{AccountName}{[required] The friendly name of the member account.

The account name can consist of only the characters
[a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.) You can't separate
characters with a dash (â€“).}

\item{RoleName}{(Optional)

The name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically preconfigures
in the new member accounts in both the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the management
account, allowing users in the management account to assume the role, as
permitted by the management account administrator. The role has
administrator permissions in the new member account.

If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to
\code{OrganizationAccountAccessRole}.

For more information about how to use this role to access the member
account, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role}{Accessing and Administering the Member Accounts in Your Organization}
in the \emph{Organizations User Guide} and steps 2 and 3 in \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html}{Tutorial: Delegate Access Across Amazon Web Services accounts Using IAM Roles}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide.}

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern} that is used to
validate this parameter. The pattern can include uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, digits with no spaces, and any of the following
characters: =,.@-}

\item{IamUserAccessToBilling}{If set to \code{ALLOW}, the new linked account in the commercial Region
enables IAM users to access account billing information \emph{if} they have
the required permissions. If set to \code{DENY}, only the root user of the
new account can access account billing information. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/control-access-billing.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate}{Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide.}

If you don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to \code{ALLOW}, and
IAM users and roles with the required permissions can access billing
information for the new account.}

\item{Tags}{A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created account.
These tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the
GovCloud account, and not to the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to
the actual GovCloud account, call the
\code{\link[=organizations_tag_resource]{tag_resource}} operation in the GovCloud
region after the new GovCloud account exists.

For each tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key and a value.
You can set the value to an empty string, but you can't set it to
\code{null}. For more information about tagging, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tagging.html}{Tagging Organizations resources}
in the Organizations User Guide.

If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the maximum allowed
number of tags for an account, then the entire request fails and the
account is not created.}
