\arguments{
\item{InstanceIds}{The IDs of the managed nodes where the command should run. Specifying
managed node IDs is most useful when you are targeting a limited number
of managed nodes, though you can specify up to 50 IDs.

To target a larger number of managed nodes, or if you prefer not to list
individual node IDs, we recommend using the \code{Targets} option instead.
Using \code{Targets}, which accepts tag key-value pairs to identify the
managed nodes to send commands to, you can a send command to tens,
hundreds, or thousands of nodes at once.

For more information about how to use targets, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html}{Using targets and rate controls to send commands to a fleet}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide}.}

\item{Targets}{An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
\verb{Key,Value} combination that you specify. Specifying targets is most
useful when you want to send a command to a large number of managed
nodes at once. Using \code{Targets}, which accepts tag key-value pairs to
identify managed nodes, you can send a command to tens, hundreds, or
thousands of nodes at once.

To send a command to a smaller number of managed nodes, you can use the
\code{InstanceIds} option instead.

For more information about how to use targets, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html}{Sending commands to a fleet}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide}.}

\item{DocumentName}{[required] The name of the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM
document) to run. This can be a public document or a custom document. To
run a shared document belonging to another account, specify the document
Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about how to use shared
documents, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-using-shared.html}{Using shared SSM documents}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide}.

If you specify a document name or ARN that hasn't been shared with your
account, you receive an \code{InvalidDocument} error.}

\item{DocumentVersion}{The SSM document version to use in the request. You can specify
$DEFAULT, $LATEST, or a specific version number. If you run commands by
using the Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), then you
must escape the first two options by using a backslash. If you specify a
version number, then you don't need to use the backslash. For example:

--document-version "\\$DEFAULT"

--document-version "\\$LATEST"

--document-version "3"}

\item{DocumentHash}{The Sha256 or Sha1 hash created by the system when the document was
created.

Sha1 hashes have been deprecated.}

\item{DocumentHashType}{Sha256 or Sha1.

Sha1 hashes have been deprecated.}

\item{TimeoutSeconds}{If this time is reached and the command hasn't already started running,
it won't run.}

\item{Comment}{User-specified information about the command, such as a brief
description of what the command should do.}

\item{Parameters}{The required and optional parameters specified in the document being
run.}

\item{OutputS3Region}{(Deprecated) You can no longer specify this parameter. The system
ignores it. Instead, Systems Manager automatically determines the Amazon
Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.}

\item{OutputS3BucketName}{The name of the S3 bucket where command execution responses should be
stored.}

\item{OutputS3KeyPrefix}{The directory structure within the S3 bucket where the responses should
be stored.}

\item{MaxConcurrency}{(Optional) The maximum number of managed nodes that are allowed to run
the command at the same time. You can specify a number such as 10 or a
percentage such as 10\%. The default value is \code{50}. For more information
about how to use \code{MaxConcurrency}, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-velocity}{Using concurrency controls}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide}.}

\item{MaxErrors}{The maximum number of errors allowed without the command failing. When
the command fails one more time beyond the value of \code{MaxErrors}, the
systems stops sending the command to additional targets. You can specify
a number like 10 or a percentage like 10\%. The default value is \code{0}. For
more information about how to use \code{MaxErrors}, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-maxerrors}{Using error controls}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide}.}

\item{ServiceRoleArn}{The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role to use
to publish Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications
for Run Command commands.}

\item{NotificationConfig}{Configurations for sending notifications.}

\item{CloudWatchOutputConfig}{Enables Amazon Web Services Systems Manager to send Run Command output
to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Run Command is a capability of Amazon Web
Services Systems Manager.}
