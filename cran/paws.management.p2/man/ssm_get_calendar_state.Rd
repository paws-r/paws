\description{
Gets the state of a Amazon Web Services Systems Manager change calendar at the current time or a specified time. If you specify a time, \code{\link[=ssm_get_calendar_state]{get_calendar_state}} returns the state of the calendar at that specific time, and returns the next time that the change calendar state will transition. If you don't specify a time, \code{\link[=ssm_get_calendar_state]{get_calendar_state}} uses the current time. Change Calendar entries have two possible states: \code{OPEN} or \code{CLOSED}.
