\description{
Amazon Web Services Support

The \emph{Amazon Web Services Support API Reference} is intended for
programmers who need detailed information about the Amazon Web Services
Support operations and data types. You can use the API to manage your
support cases programmatically. The Amazon Web Services Support API uses
HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.
\itemize{
\item You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
\item If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that
does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
plan, the \code{SubscriptionRequiredException} error message appears. For
information about changing your support plan, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/}{Amazon Web Services Support}.
}

The Amazon Web Services Support service also exposes a set of \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/}{Trusted Advisor}
features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get
check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of
checks.

The following list describes the Amazon Web Services Support case
management operations:
\itemize{
\item Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels - The
\code{\link[=support_describe_services]{describe_services}} and
\code{\link[=support_describe_severity_levels]{describe_severity_levels}}
operations return Amazon Web Services service names, service codes,
service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these
values when you call the \code{\link[=support_create_case]{create_case}}
operation.
\item Case creation, case details, and case resolution - The
\code{\link[=support_create_case]{create_case}},
\code{\link[=support_describe_cases]{describe_cases}},
\code{\link[=support_describe_attachment]{describe_attachment}}, and
\code{\link[=support_resolve_case]{resolve_case}} operations create Amazon Web
Services Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and
resolve cases.
\item Case communication - The
\code{\link[=support_describe_communications]{describe_communications}},
\code{\link[=support_add_communication_to_case]{add_communication_to_case}},
and \code{\link[=support_add_attachments_to_set]{add_attachments_to_set}}
operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to Amazon
Web Services Support cases.
}

The following list describes the operations available from the Amazon
Web Services Support service for Trusted Advisor:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_checks]{describe_trusted_advisor_checks}}
returns the list of checks that run against your Amazon Web Services
resources.
\item Using the \code{checkId} for a specific check returned by
\code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_checks]{describe_trusted_advisor_checks}},
you can call
\code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_check_result]{describe_trusted_advisor_check_result}}
to obtain the results for the check that you specified.
\item \code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_check_summaries]{describe_trusted_advisor_check_summaries}}
returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.
\item \code{\link[=support_refresh_trusted_advisor_check]{refresh_trusted_advisor_check}}
requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check.
\item \code{\link[=support_describe_trusted_advisor_check_refresh_statuses]{describe_trusted_advisor_check_refresh_statuses}}
reports the refresh status of one or more checks.
}

For authentication of requests, Amazon Web Services Support uses
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing-aws-api-requests.html}{Signature Version 4 Signing Process}.

See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/about-support-api.html}{About the Amazon Web Services Support API}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Support User Guide} for information about
how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how
to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.
