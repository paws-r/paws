end in \verb{_WSP}. To use BYOP, specify a value that ends in \verb{_BYOP}.

For non-GPU-enabled bundles (bundles other than Graphics or
GraphicsPro), specify \code{BYOL_REGULAR}, \code{BYOL_REGULAR_WSP}, or
\code{BYOL_REGULAR_BYOP}, depending on the protocol.

The \code{BYOL_REGULAR_BYOP} and \code{BYOL_GRAPHICS_G4DN_BYOP} values are only
supported by Amazon WorkSpaces Core. Contact your account team to be
allow-listed to use these values. For more information, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces-family/core/}{Amazon WorkSpaces Core}.}

this time.
\item During the image import process, non-GPU DCV (formerly WSP)
WorkSpaces with Windows 11 support only \code{Microsoft_Office_2019}. GPU
DCV (formerly WSP) WorkSpaces with Windows 11 do not support Office
