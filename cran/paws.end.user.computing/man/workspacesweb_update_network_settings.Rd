\usage{
workspacesweb_update_network_settings(
  networkSettingsArn,
  vpcId = NULL,
  subnetIds = NULL,
  securityGroupIds = NULL,
  clientToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{networkSettingsArn}{[required] The ARN of the network settings.}

\item{vpcId}{The VPC that streaming instances will connect to.}

\item{subnetIds}{The subnets in which network interfaces are created to connect streaming
instances to your VPC. At least two of these subnets must be in
different availability zones.}

\item{securityGroupIds}{One or more security groups used to control access from streaming
instances to your VPC.}

\item{clientToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API request
completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original request
completes successfully, subsequent retries with the same client token
return the result from the original successful request.

If you do not specify a client token, one is automatically generated by
the Amazon Web Services SDK.}
