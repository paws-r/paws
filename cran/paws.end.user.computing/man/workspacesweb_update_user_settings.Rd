  userSettingsArn,

  downloadAllowed = NULL,
  uploadAllowed = NULL,
  printAllowed = NULL,
  disconnectTimeoutInMinutes = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{userSettingsArn}{[required] The ARN of the user settings.}

\item{copyAllowed}{Specifies whether the user can copy text from the streaming session to
the local device.}

\item{pasteAllowed}{Specifies whether the user can paste text from the local device to the
streaming session.}

\item{downloadAllowed}{Specifies whether the user can download files from the streaming session
to the local device.}

\item{uploadAllowed}{Specifies whether the user can upload files from the local device to the
streaming session.}

\item{printAllowed}{Specifies whether the user can print to the local device.}

\item{disconnectTimeoutInMinutes}{The amount of time that a streaming session remains active after users
disconnect.}

\item{idleDisconnectTimeoutInMinutes}{The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they are
disconnected from their streaming session and the disconnect timeout
interval begins.}

\item{clientToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API request
completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original request
completes successfully, subsequent retries with the same client token
return the result from the original successful request.

If you do not specify a client token, one is automatically generated by
the Amazon Web Services SDK.}

\item{cookieSynchronizationConfiguration}{The configuration that specifies which cookies should be synchronized
from the end user's local browser to the remote browser.

If the allowlist and blocklist are empty, the configuration becomes
null.}

\item{deepLinkAllowed}{Specifies whether the user can use deep links that open automatically
when connecting to a session.}

\item{toolbarConfiguration}{The configuration of the toolbar. This allows administrators to select
the toolbar type and visual mode, set maximum display resolution for
sessions, and choose which items are visible to end users during their
sessions. If administrators do not modify these settings, end users
retain control over their toolbar preferences.}

\item{brandingConfigurationInput}{The branding configuration that customizes the appearance of the web
portal for end users. When updating user settings without an existing
branding configuration, all fields (logo, favicon, wallpaper, localized
strings, and color theme) are required except for terms of service. When
updating user settings with an existing branding configuration, all
fields are optional.}

\item{webAuthnAllowed}{Specifies whether the user can use WebAuthn redirection for passwordless
login to websites within the streaming session.}
