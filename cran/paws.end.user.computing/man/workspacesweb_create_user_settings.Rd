\arguments{
\item{clientToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API request
completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original request
completes successfully, subsequent retries with the same client token
returns the result from the original successful request.

If you do not specify a client token, one is automatically generated by
the AWS SDK.}
