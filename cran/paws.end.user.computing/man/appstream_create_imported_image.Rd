appstream_create_imported_image(
  Name,
  SourceAmiId,
  IamRoleArn,
  Description = NULL,
  DisplayName = NULL,
  Tags = NULL,
  RuntimeValidationConfig = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] A unique name for the imported image. The name must be between 1 and 100
characters and can contain letters, numbers, underscores, periods, and
hyphens.}

\item{SourceAmiId}{[required] The ID of the EC2 AMI to import. The AMI must meet specific requirements
including Windows Server 2022 Full Base, UEFI boot mode, TPM 2.0
support, and proper drivers.}

\item{IamRoleArn}{[required] The ARN of the IAM role that allows WorkSpaces Applications to access
your AMI. The role must have permissions to modify image attributes and
describe images, with a trust relationship allowing
appstream.amazonaws.com to assume the role.}

\item{Description}{An optional description for the imported image. The description must
match approved regex patterns and can be up to 256 characters.}

\item{DisplayName}{An optional display name for the imported image. The display name must
match approved regex patterns and can be up to 100 characters.}

\item{Tags}{The tags to apply to the imported image. Tags help you organize and
manage your WorkSpaces Applications resources.}

\item{RuntimeValidationConfig}{Configuration for runtime validation of the imported image. When
specified, WorkSpaces Applications provisions an instance to test
streaming functionality, which helps ensure the image is suitable for
use.}

\item{AgentSoftwareVersion}{The version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent to use for the imported
image. Choose CURRENT_LATEST to use the agent version available at the
time of import, or ALWAYS_LATEST to automatically update to the latest
agent version when new versions are released.}

\item{AppCatalogConfig}{Configuration for the application catalog of the imported image. This
allows you to specify applications available for streaming, including
their paths, icons, and launch parameters. This field contains sensitive
data.}

\item{DryRun}{When set to true, performs validation checks without actually creating
the imported image. Use this to verify your configuration before
executing the actual import operation.}
