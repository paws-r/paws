spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-}

This parameter allows (through its \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern}) a string of characters
consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must
begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any
ASCII character from the ! (\code{U+0021}) through the DEL character

the user's name.

IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the
