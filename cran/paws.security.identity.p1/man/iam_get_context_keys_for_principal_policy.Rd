\title{Gets a list of all of the context keys referenced in all the IAM
policies that are attached to the specified IAM entity}
\usage{
iam_get_context_keys_for_principal_policy(
  PolicySourceArn,
  PolicyInputList = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PolicySourceArn}{[required] The ARN of a user, group, or role whose policies contain the context
keys that you want listed. If you specify a user, the list includes
context keys that are found in all policies that are attached to the
user. The list also includes all groups that the user is a member of. If
you pick a group or a role, then it includes only those context keys
that are found in policies attached to that entity. Note that all
parameters are shown in unencoded form here for clarity, but must be URL
encoded to be included as a part of a real HTML request.

For more information about ARNs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html}{Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference}.}

\item{PolicyInputList}{An optional list of additional policies for which you want the list of
context keys that are referenced.

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern} used to
validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the
following:
\itemize{
\item Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character
(\code{U+0020}) through the end of the ASCII character range
\item The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
character set (through \verb{U+00FF})
\item The special characters tab (\code{U+0009}), line feed (\verb{U+000A}), and
carriage return (\verb{U+000D})
}}
}
