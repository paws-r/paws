\arguments{
\item{FindingIdentifiers}{[required] The list of findings to update.
\code{\link[=securityhub_batch_update_findings]{batch_update_findings}} can be used
to update up to 100 findings at a time.

For each finding, the list provides the finding identifier and the ARN
of the finding provider.}

\item{Note}{}

\item{Severity}{Used to update the finding severity.}

\item{VerificationState}{Indicates the veracity of a finding.

The available values for \code{VerificationState} are as follows.
\itemize{
\item \code{UNKNOWN} – The default disposition of a security finding
\item \code{TRUE_POSITIVE} – The security finding is confirmed
\item \code{FALSE_POSITIVE} – The security finding was determined to be a false
alarm
\item \code{BENIGN_POSITIVE} – A special case of \code{TRUE_POSITIVE} where the
finding doesn't pose any threat, is expected, or both
}}

\item{Confidence}{The updated value for the finding confidence. Confidence is defined as
the likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or
issue that it was intended to identify.

Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0 means
zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confidence.}

\item{Criticality}{The updated value for the level of importance assigned to the resources
associated with the findings.

A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criticality,
and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.}

\item{Types}{One or more finding types in the format of namespace/category/classifier
that classify a finding.

Valid namespace values are as follows.
\itemize{
\item Software and Configuration Checks
\item TTPs
\item Effects
\item Unusual Behaviors
\item Sensitive Data Identifications
}}

\item{UserDefinedFields}{A list of name/value string pairs associated with the finding. These are
custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.}

\item{Workflow}{Used to update the workflow status of a finding.

The workflow status indicates the progress of the investigation into the
finding.}

\item{RelatedFindings}{A list of findings that are related to the updated findings.}
