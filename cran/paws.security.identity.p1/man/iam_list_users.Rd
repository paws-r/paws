\title{Lists the IAM users that have the specified path prefix}
\usage{
iam_list_users(PathPrefix = NULL, Marker = NULL, MaxItems = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{PathPrefix}{The path prefix for filtering the results. For example:
\verb{/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/}, which would get all user names whose
path starts with \verb{/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/}.

This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
slash (/), listing all user names. This parameter allows (through its
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern}) a string of
characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a
string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can
contain any ASCII character from the ! (\code{U+0021}) through the DEL
character (\verb{U+007F}), including most punctuation characters, digits, and
upper and lowercased letters.}

\item{Marker}{Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you
receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to
the value of the \code{Marker} element in the response that you received to
indicate where the next call should start.}

\item{MaxItems}{Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of
items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the
maximum you specify, the \code{IsTruncated} response element is \code{true}.

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to
100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more
results available. In that case, the \code{IsTruncated} response element
returns \code{true}, and \code{Marker} contains a value to include in the
subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.}

\description{
Lists the IAM users that have the specified path prefix. If no path prefix is specified, the operation returns all users in the Amazon Web Services account. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list.
