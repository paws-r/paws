\usage{
iam_upload_ssh_public_key(UserName, SSHPublicKeyBody)
}
\arguments{
\item{UserName}{[required] The name of the IAM user to associate the SSH public key with.

This parameter allows (through its \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern}) a string of characters
consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-}

\item{SSHPublicKeyBody}{[required] The SSH public key. The public key must be encoded in ssh-rsa format or
PEM format. The minimum bit-length of the public key is 2048 bits. For
example, you can generate a 2048-bit key, and the resulting PEM file is
1679 bytes long.

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex}{regex pattern} used to
validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the
following:
\itemize{
\item Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character
(\code{U+0020}) through the end of the ASCII character range
\item The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
character set (through \verb{U+00FF})
\item The special characters tab (\code{U+0009}), line feed (\verb{U+000A}), and
carriage return (\verb{U+000D})
