#' Get the state for a routing control

#' @description
#' Get the state for a routing control. A routing control is a simple on/off switch that you can use to route traffic to cells. When a routing control state is On, traffic flows to a cell. When the state is Off, traffic does not flow.

#' List routing control names and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), as well as the routing control state for each routing control, along with the control panel name and control panel ARN for the routing controls. If you specify a control panel ARN, this call lists the routing controls in the control panel. Otherwise, it lists all the routing controls in the cluster.
