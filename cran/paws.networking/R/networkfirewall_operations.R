#' Creates the specified stateless or stateful rule group, which includes

#'
#' @description
#' Creates the specified stateless or stateful rule group, which includes the rules for network traffic inspection, a capacity setting, and tags.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/networkfirewall_create_rule_group/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/networkfirewall_create_rule_group/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param RuleGroupName &#91;required&#93; The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a
#' rule group after you create it.
#' @param RuleGroup An object that defines the rule group rules.
#' 
#' You must provide either this rule group setting or a `Rules` setting,
#' but not both.
#' @param Rules A string containing stateful rule group rules specifications in Suricata
#' flat format, with one rule per line. Use this to import your existing
#' Suricata compatible rule groups.
#' 
#' You must provide either this rules setting or a populated `RuleGroup`
#' setting, but not both.
#' 
#' You can provide your rule group specification in Suricata flat format
#' through this setting when you create or update your rule group. The call
#' response returns a RuleGroup object that Network Firewall has populated
#' from your string.
#' @param Type &#91;required&#93; Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule
#' group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it
#' contains stateful rules.
#' @param Description A description of the rule group.
#' @param Capacity &#91;required&#93; The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group
#' capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are
#' limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a
#' firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule
#' group.
#' 
#' You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group
#' before you create the rule group by calling
#' [`create_rule_group`][networkfirewall_create_rule_group] with `DryRun`
#' set to `TRUE`.
#' 
#' You can't change or exceed this capacity when you update the rule group,
#' so leave room for your rule group to grow.
#' 
#' **Capacity for a stateless rule group**
#' 
#' For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the
#' capacity requirements of the individual rules that you expect to have in
#' the rule group.
#' 
#' To calculate the capacity requirement of a single rule, multiply the
#' capacity requirement values of each of the rule's match settings:
#' 
#' -   A match setting with no criteria specified has a value of 1.
#' 
#' -   A match setting with `Any` specified has a value of 1.
#' 
#' -   All other match settings have a value equal to the number of
#'     elements provided in the setting. For example, a protocol setting
#'     \["UDP"\] and a source setting \["10.0.0.0/24"\] each have a value
#'     of 1. A protocol setting \["UDP","TCP"\] has a value of 2. A source
#'     setting \["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"\] has a value of
#'     3.
#' 
#' A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has a
#' capacity requirement of 1. A rule with protocol setting \["UDP","TCP"\],
#' source setting \["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"\], and a
#' single specification or no specification for each of the other match
#' settings has a capacity requirement of 6.
#' 
#' **Capacity for a stateful rule group**
#' 
#' For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity required is the number
#' of individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group.
#' @param Tags The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.
#' @param DryRun Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity
#' of the request, rather than run the request.
#' 
#' If set to `TRUE`, Network Firewall checks whether the request can run
#' successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call
#' returns the value that the request would return if you ran it with dry
#' run set to `FALSE`, but doesn't make additions or changes to your
#' resources. This option allows you to make sure that you have the
#' required permissions to run the request and that your request parameters
#' are valid.
#' 
#' If set to `FALSE`, Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your
#' resources.
#' @param EncryptionConfiguration A complex type that contains settings for encryption of your rule group
#' resources.
#' @param SourceMetadata A complex type that contains metadata about the rule group that your own
#' rule group is copied from. You can use the metadata to keep track of
#' updates made to the originating rule group.
#' @param AnalyzeRuleGroup Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to analyze the stateless
#' rules in the rule group for rule behavior such as asymmetric routing. If
#' set to `TRUE`, Network Firewall runs the analysis and then creates the
#' rule group for you. To run the stateless rule group analyzer without
#' creating the rule group, set `DryRun` to `TRUE`.

#' Creates an Network Firewall TLS inspection configuration
#'
#' @description
#' Creates an Network Firewall TLS inspection configuration. A TLS inspection configuration contains Certificate Manager certificate associations between and the scope configurations that Network Firewall uses to decrypt and re-encrypt traffic traveling through your firewall.

#' @param TLSInspectionConfiguration &#91;required&#93; The object that defines a TLS inspection configuration. This, along with
#' TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse, define the TLS inspection
#' configuration. You can retrieve all objects for a TLS inspection
#' configuration by calling
#' [`describe_tls_inspection_configuration`][networkfirewall_describe_tls_inspection_configuration].
#' 
#' Network Firewall uses a TLS inspection configuration to decrypt traffic.
#' Network Firewall re-encrypts the traffic before sending it to its

#' 
#' To use a TLS inspection configuration, you add it to a new Network
#' Firewall firewall policy, then you apply the firewall policy to a

#' inspect the traffic traveling through your firewalls. You can reference

#'
#' @param TLSInspectionConfigurationArn The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the TLS inspection configuration.
#' @param TLSInspectionConfigurationName The descriptive name of the TLS inspection configuration. You can't
#' change the name of a TLS inspection configuration after you create it.
#' @param TLSInspectionConfiguration &#91;required&#93; The object that defines a TLS inspection configuration. This, along with
#' TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse, define the TLS inspection
#' configuration. You can retrieve all objects for a TLS inspection
#' configuration by calling
#' [`describe_tls_inspection_configuration`][networkfirewall_describe_tls_inspection_configuration].
#' 
#' Network Firewall uses a TLS inspection configuration to decrypt traffic.
#' Network Firewall re-encrypts the traffic before sending it to its
#' destination.
#' 
#' To use a TLS inspection configuration, you add it to a new Network
#' Firewall firewall policy, then you apply the firewall policy to a
#' firewall. Network Firewall acts as a proxy service to decrypt and
#' inspect the traffic traveling through your firewalls. You can reference
#' a TLS inspection configuration from more than one firewall policy, and
#' you can use a firewall policy in more than one firewall. For more
#' information about using TLS inspection configurations, see [Inspecting
#' SSL/TLS traffic with TLS inspection
#' configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/)
#' in the *Network Firewall Developer Guide*.
#' @param Description A description of the TLS inspection configuration.
#' @param EncryptionConfiguration A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS encryption
#' configuration settings for your TLS inspection configuration.
#' @param UpdateToken &#91;required&#93; A token used for optimistic locking. Network Firewall returns a token to
#' your requests that access the TLS inspection configuration. The token
#' marks the state of the TLS inspection configuration resource at the time
#' of the request.
#' 
#' To make changes to the TLS inspection configuration, you provide the
#' token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that
#' the TLS inspection configuration hasn't changed since you last retrieved
#' it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an
#' `InvalidTokenException`. If this happens, retrieve the TLS inspection
#' configuration again to get a current copy of it with a current token.
#' Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the
#' new token.
