\description{
When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS
resolution within the VPC from Route 53 Resolver. By default, Resolver
answers DNS queries for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2
instances or ELB load balancers. Resolver performs recursive lookups
against public name servers for all other domain names.

You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network
over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:

\strong{Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53
Resolver}

DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a
specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain
names for AWS resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53
private hosted zone. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-network-to-vpc}{How DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver}
in the \emph{Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide}.

\strong{Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your
network}

You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2
instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward
selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain
names for the DNS queries that you want to forward (such as
example.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network
that you want to forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple
rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with
the most specific match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the
IP addresses that you specified in that rule. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-vpc-to-network}{How Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network}
in the \emph{Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide}.

Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is regional. In each region where you have
VPCs, you can choose whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your
network (outbound queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound
queries), or both.
