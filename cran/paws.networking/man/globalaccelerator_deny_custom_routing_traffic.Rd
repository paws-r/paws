\title{Specify the Amazon EC2 instance (destination) IP addresses and ports for
a VPC subnet endpoint that cannot receive traffic for a custom routing
accelerator}
\usage{
globalaccelerator_deny_custom_routing_traffic(EndpointGroupArn,
  EndpointId, DestinationAddresses, DestinationPorts,
  DenyAllTrafficToEndpoint)
}
\arguments{
\item{EndpointGroupArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.}

\item{EndpointId}{[required] An ID for the endpoint. For custom routing accelerators, this is the
virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet ID.}

\item{DestinationAddresses}{A list of specific Amazon EC2 instance IP addresses (destination
addresses) in a subnet that you want to prevent from receiving traffic.
The IP addresses must be a subset of the IP addresses allowed for the
VPC subnet associated with the endpoint group.}

\item{DestinationPorts}{A list of specific Amazon EC2 instance ports (destination ports) in a
subnet endpoint that you want to prevent from receiving traffic.}

\item{DenyAllTrafficToEndpoint}{Indicates whether all destination IP addresses and ports for a specified
VPC subnet endpoint \emph{cannot} receive traffic from a custom routing
accelerator. The value is TRUE or FALSE.

When set to TRUE, \emph{no} destinations in the custom routing VPC subnet can
receive traffic. Note that you cannot specify destination IP addresses
and ports when the value is set to TRUE.

When set to FALSE (or not specified), you \emph{must} specify a list of
destination IP addresses that cannot receive traffic. A list of ports is
optional. If you don't specify a list of ports, the ports that can
accept traffic is the same as the ports configured for the endpoint
group.

The default value is FALSE.}
}
\description{
Specify the Amazon EC2 instance (destination) IP addresses and ports for
a VPC subnet endpoint that cannot receive traffic for a custom routing
accelerator. You can deny traffic to all destinations in the VPC
endpoint, or deny traffic to a specified list of destination IP
addresses and ports. Note that you cannot specify IP addresses or ports
outside of the range that you configured for the endpoint group.

After you make changes, you can verify that the updates are complete by
checking the status of your accelerator: the status changes from
IN\\_PROGRESS to DEPLOYED.
