\arguments{
\item{Marker}{If the value of \code{IsTruncated} in the previous response was \code{true}, you
have more hosted zones. To get more hosted zones, submit another
\code{\link[=route53_list_hosted_zones]{list_hosted_zones}} request.

For the value of \code{marker}, specify the value of \code{NextMarker} from the
previous response, which is the ID of the first hosted zone that Amazon

If the value of \code{IsTruncated} in the previous response was \code{false},
there are no more hosted zones to get.}

\item{MaxItems}{(Optional) The maximum number of hosted zones that you want Amazon Route
53 to return. If you have more than \code{maxitems} hosted zones, the value
of \code{IsTruncated} in the response is \code{true}, and the value of
\code{NextMarker} is the hosted zone ID of the first hosted zone that Route
53 will return if you submit another request.}
