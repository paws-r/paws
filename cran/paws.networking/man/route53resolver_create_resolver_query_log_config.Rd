\usage{
route53resolver_create_resolver_query_log_config(
  Name,
  DestinationArn,
  CreatorRequestId,
  Tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name that you want to give the query logging configuration.}

\item{DestinationArn}{[required] The ARN of the resource that you want Resolver to send query logs. You
can send query logs to an S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a
Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Examples of valid values include
the following:
\itemize{
\item \strong{S3 bucket}:

\code{arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket}

You can optionally append a file prefix to the end of the ARN.

\verb{arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/development/}
\item \strong{CloudWatch Logs log group}:

\verb{arn:aws:logs:us-west-1:123456789012:log-group:/mystack-testgroup-12ABC1AB12A1:*}
\item \strong{Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream}:

\code{arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-2:0123456789:stream/my_stream_name}
}}

\item{CreatorRequestId}{[required] A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed
requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.
\code{CreatorRequestId} can be any unique string, for example, a date/time
stamp.}

\item{Tags}{A list of the tag keys and values that you want to associate with the
query logging configuration.}
}
\description{
