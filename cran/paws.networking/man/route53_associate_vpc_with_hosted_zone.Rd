\usage{
route53_associate_vpc_with_hosted_zone(HostedZoneId, VPC, Comment)
}
\arguments{
\item{HostedZoneId}{[required] The ID of the private hosted zone that you want to associate an Amazon
VPC with.

Note that you can\'t associate a VPC with a hosted zone that doesn\'t
have an existing VPC association.}

\item{VPC}{[required] A complex type that contains information about the VPC that you want to

\item{Comment}{\emph{Optional:} A comment about the association request.}
}
\description{
Associates an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone.
}
\details{
To perform the association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must
already exist. You can\'t convert a public hosted zone into a private
hosted zone.

If you want to associate a VPC that was created by using one AWS account
with a private hosted zone that was created by using a different
account, the AWS account that created the private hosted zone must first
submit a \code{CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization} request. Then the account
that created the VPC must submit an \code{AssociateVPCWithHostedZone}
request.
