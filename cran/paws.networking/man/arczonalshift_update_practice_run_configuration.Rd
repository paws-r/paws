\title{Update a practice run configuration to change one or more of the
following: add, change, or remove the blocking alarm; change the outcome
alarm; or add, change, or remove blocking dates or time windows}
\usage{
arczonalshift_update_practice_run_configuration(
  blockedDates = NULL,
  blockedWindows = NULL,
  blockingAlarms = NULL,
  outcomeAlarms = NULL,
  resourceIdentifier
)
}
\arguments{
\item{blockedDates}{Add, change, or remove blocked dates for a practice run in zonal
autoshift.

Optionally, you can block practice runs for specific calendar dates. The
format for blocked dates is: YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind, when you specify
dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Separate
multiple blocked dates with spaces.

For example, if you have an application update scheduled to launch on
May 1, 2024, and you don't want practice runs to shift traffic away at
that time, you could set a blocked date for \code{2024-05-01}.}

\item{blockedWindows}{Add, change, or remove windows of days and times for when you can,
optionally, block ARC from starting a practice run for a resource.

The format for blocked windows is: DAY:HH:SS-DAY:HH:SS. Keep in mind,
when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in
UTC. Also, be aware of potential time adjustments that might be required
for daylight saving time differences. Separate multiple blocked windows
with spaces.

For example, say you run business report summaries three days a week.
For this scenario, you might set the following recurring days and times
as blocked windows, for example:
\verb{MON-20:30-21:30 WED-20:30-21:30 FRI-20:30-21:30}.}

\item{blockingAlarms}{Add, change, or remove the Amazon CloudWatch alarm that you optionally
specify as the blocking alarm for practice runs.}

\item{outcomeAlarms}{Specify a new the Amazon CloudWatch alarm as the outcome alarm for
practice runs.}

\item{resourceIdentifier}{[required] The identifier for the resource that you want to update the practice run
configuration for. The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for
the resource.}
}
