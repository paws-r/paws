\title{Update an active zonal shift in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery
Controller in your Amazon Web Services account}
\usage{
arczonalshift_update_zonal_shift(
  comment = NULL,
  expiresIn = NULL,
  zonalShiftId
)
}
\arguments{
\item{comment}{A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the latest comment
is retained; no comment history is maintained. A new comment overwrites
any existing comment string.}

\item{expiresIn}{The length of time that you want a zonal shift to be active, which ARC
converts to an expiry time (expiration time). Zonal shifts are
temporary. You can set a zonal shift to be active initially for up to
three days (72 hours).

If you want to still keep traffic away from an Availability Zone, you
can update the zonal shift and set a new expiration. You can also cancel
a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're ready to
restore traffic to the Availability Zone.

To set a length of time for a zonal shift to be active, specify a whole
number, and then one of the following, with no space:
\itemize{
\item \strong{A lowercase letter m:} To specify that the value is in minutes.
\item \strong{A lowercase letter h:} To specify that the value is in hours.
}

For example: \verb{20h} means the zonal shift expires in 20 hours. \verb{120m}
means the zonal shift expires in 120 minutes (2 hours).}

\item{zonalShiftId}{[required] The identifier of a zonal shift.}
}
