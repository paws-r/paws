\description{
Associates a Resolver rule with a VPC. When you associate a rule with a
VPC, Resolver forwards all DNS queries for the domain name that is
specified in the rule and that originate in the VPC. The queries are
forwarded to the IP addresses for the DNS resolvers that are specified
in the rule. For more information about rules, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverRule.html}{CreateResolverRule}.
