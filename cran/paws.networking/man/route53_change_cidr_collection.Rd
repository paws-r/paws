\title{Creates, changes, or deletes CIDR blocks within a collection}
\usage{
route53_change_cidr_collection(Id, CollectionVersion = NULL, Changes)
}
\arguments{
\item{Id}{[required] The UUID of the CIDR collection to update.}

\item{CollectionVersion}{A sequential counter that Amazon Route 53 sets to 1 when you create a
collection and increments it by 1 each time you update the collection.

We recommend that you use \code{ListCidrCollection} to get the current value
of \code{CollectionVersion} for the collection that you want to update, and
then include that value with the change request. This prevents Route 53
from overwriting an intervening update:
\itemize{
\item If the value in the request matches the value of \code{CollectionVersion}
in the collection, Route 53 updates the collection.
\item If the value of \code{CollectionVersion} in the collection is greater
than the value in the request, the collection was changed after you
got the version number. Route 53 does not update the collection, and
it returns a \code{CidrCollectionVersionMismatch} error.
}}

\item{Changes}{[required] Information about changes to a CIDR collection.}
}
\description{
Creates, changes, or deletes CIDR blocks within a collection. Contains authoritative IP information mapping blocks to one or multiple locations.
