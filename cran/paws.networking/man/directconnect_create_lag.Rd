\description{
Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical dedicated connections between the customer network and a specific Direct Connect location. A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface.
