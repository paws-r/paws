  numberOfConnections,
  location,
  connectionsBandwidth,
  lagName,
  connectionId = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{numberOfConnections}{[required] The number of physical dedicated connections initially provisioned and
bundled by the LAG. You can have a maximum of four connections when the
port speed is 1Gbps or 10Gbps, or two when the port speed is 100Gbps or
400Gbps.}

\item{location}{[required] The location for the LAG.}

\item{connectionsBandwidth}{[required] The bandwidth of the individual physical dedicated connections bundled
by the LAG. The possible values are 1Gbps,10Gbps, 100Gbps, and 400Gbps.}

\item{lagName}{[required] The name of the LAG.}

\item{connectionId}{The ID of an existing dedicated connection to migrate to the LAG.}

\item{tags}{The tags to associate with the LAG.}

\item{childConnectionTags}{The tags to associate with the automtically created LAGs.}

\item{providerName}{The name of the service provider associated with the LAG.}

\item{requestMACSec}{Indicates whether the connection will support MAC Security (MACsec).

All connections in the LAG must be capable of supporting MAC Security
(MACsec). For information about MAC Security (MACsec) prerequisties, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/#mac-sec-prerequisites}{MACsec prerequisties}

\description{
Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical dedicated connections between the customer network and a specific Direct Connect location. A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface.
