\description{
Welcome to the API Reference Guide for zonal shift and zonal autoshift
in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller (ARC).

You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource
away from an Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly
from an impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover
your application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an
Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability
Zone.

You can also configure zonal autoshift for supported load balancer
resources. Zonal autoshift is a capability in ARC where you authorize
Amazon Web Services to shift away application resource traffic from an
Availability Zone during events, on your behalf, to help reduce your
time to recovery. Amazon Web Services starts an autoshift when internal
telemetry indicates that there is an Availability Zone impairment that
could potentially impact customers.

To help make sure that zonal autoshift is safe for your application, you
must also configure practice runs when you enable zonal autoshift for a
resource. Practice runs start weekly zonal shifts for a resource, to
shift traffic for the resource away from an Availability Zone. Practice
runs help you to make sure, on a regular basis, that you have enough
capacity in all the Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region
for your application to continue to operate normally when traffic for a
resource is shifted away from one Availability Zone.

Before you configure practice runs or enable zonal autoshift, we
strongly recommend that you prescale your application resource capacity
in all Availability Zones in the Region where your application resources
are deployed. You should not rely on scaling on demand when an autoshift
or practice run starts. Zonal autoshift, including practice runs, works
independently, and does not wait for auto scaling actions to complete.
Relying on auto scaling, instead of pre-scaling, can result in loss of
availability.

If you use auto scaling to handle regular cycles of traffic, we strongly
recommend that you configure the minimum capacity of your auto scaling
to continue operating normally with the loss of an Availability Zone.

Be aware that ARC does not inspect the health of individual resources.
Amazon Web Services only starts an autoshift when Amazon Web Services
telemetry detects that there is an Availability Zone impairment that
could potentially impact customers. In some cases, resources might be
shifted away that are not experiencing impact.
