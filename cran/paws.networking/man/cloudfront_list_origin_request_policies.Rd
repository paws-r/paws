\description{
Gets a list of origin request policies.
}
\details{
You can optionally apply a filter to return only the managed policies
created by AWS, or only the custom policies created in your AWS account.

You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the
response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum
that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To
get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the
\code{NextMarker} value from the current response as the \code{Marker} value in
the subsequent request.
