\usage{
route53_list_geo_locations(
  StartContinentCode = NULL,
  StartCountryCode = NULL,
  StartSubdivisionCode = NULL,
  MaxItems = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{StartContinentCode}{The code for the continent with which you want to start listing
locations that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has
already returned a page or more of results, if \code{IsTruncated} is true,
and if \code{NextContinentCode} from the previous response has a value, enter
that value in \code{startcontinentcode} to return the next page of results.

Include \code{startcontinentcode} only if you want to list continents. Don't
include \code{startcontinentcode} when you're listing countries or countries
with their subdivisions.}

\item{StartCountryCode}{The code for the country with which you want to start listing locations
that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has already
returned a page or more of results, if \code{IsTruncated} is \code{true}, and if
\code{NextCountryCode} from the previous response has a value, enter that
value in \code{startcountrycode} to return the next page of results.}

\item{StartSubdivisionCode}{The code for the state of the United States with which you want to start
listing locations that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If
Route 53 has already returned a page or more of results, if
\code{IsTruncated} is \code{true}, and if \code{NextSubdivisionCode} from the previous
response has a value, enter that value in \code{startsubdivisioncode} to
return the next page of results.

To list subdivisions (U.S. states), you must include both
\code{startcountrycode} and \code{startsubdivisioncode}.}

\item{MaxItems}{(Optional) The maximum number of geolocations to be included in the
response body for this request. If more than \code{maxitems} geolocations
remain to be listed, then the value of the \code{IsTruncated} element in the
response is \code{true}.}
