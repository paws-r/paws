\description{
Deletes a service network. You can only delete the service network if there is no service or VPC associated with it. If you delete a service network, all resources related to the service network, such as the resource policy, auth policy, and access log subscriptions, are also deleted. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/service-networks.html#delete-service-network}{Delete a service network} in the \emph{Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide}.
