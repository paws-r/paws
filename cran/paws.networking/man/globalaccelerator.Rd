This is the \emph{AWS Global Accelerator API Reference}. This guide is for
developers who need detailed information about AWS Global Accelerator
API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global
Accelerator features, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html}{AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide}.

AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service in which you create
accelerators to improve availability and performance for internet
applications used by a global audience.

You must specify the US-West-2 (Oregon) Region to create or update
accelerators.

Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you
associate with your accelerator. These IP addresses are anycast from the
AWS edge network and distribute incoming application traffic across
multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the
availability of your applications. Endpoints can be Elastic IP
addresses, Network Load Balancers, and Application Load Balancers that
are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions.

Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the
optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies
that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or
configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is directed
to only healthy endpoints.

Global Accelerator includes components that work together to help you
improve performance and availability for your applications:
\subsection{Static IP address}{

AWS Global Accelerator provides you with a set of static IP addresses
which are anycast from the AWS edge network and serve as the single
fixed entry points for your clients. If you already have Elastic Load
Balancing or Elastic IP address resources set up for your applications,
you can easily add those to Global Accelerator to allow the resources to
be accessed by a Global Accelerator static IP address.
}

\subsection{Accelerator}{

An accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global
network to improve availability and performance for your internet
applications that have a global audience. Each accelerator includes one
or more listeners.
}

\subsection{Network zone}{

A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator
from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network
zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure.
When you configure an accelerator, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4
addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes
unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or
network disruptions, then client applications can retry on the healthy
static IP address from the other isolated network zone.
}

\subsection{Listener}{

A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global
Accelerator, based on the protocol and port that you configure. Each
listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic
is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint
groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to
distribute traffic to. Traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints
within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.
}

\subsection{Endpoint group}{

Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint
groups include one or more endpoints in the Region. You can increase or
reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an
endpoint group by adjusting a setting called a \emph{traffic dial}. The
traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green
deployment testing for new releases across different AWS Regions, for
example.
}

\subsection{Endpoint}{

An endpoint is an Elastic IP address, Network Load Balancer, or
Application Load Balancer. Traffic is routed to endpoints based on
several factors, including the geo-proximity to the user, the health of
the endpoint, and the configuration options that you choose, such as
endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which
are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to
route to each one. This can be useful, for example, to do performance
testing within a Region.
