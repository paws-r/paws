\title{Lists the Resolver rules that were created using the current Amazon Web
Services account}
\usage{
route53resolver_list_resolver_rules(
  MaxResults = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL,
  Filters = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of Resolver rules that you want to return in the
response to a
\code{\link[=route53resolver_list_resolver_rules]{list_resolver_rules}} request. If
you don't specify a value for \code{MaxResults}, Resolver returns up to 100
Resolver rules.}

\item{NextToken}{For the first
\code{\link[=route53resolver_list_resolver_rules]{list_resolver_rules}} request,
omit this value.

If you have more than \code{MaxResults} Resolver rules, you can submit
another \code{\link[=route53resolver_list_resolver_rules]{list_resolver_rules}}
request to get the next group of Resolver rules. In the next request,
specify the value of \code{NextToken} from the previous response.}

\item{Filters}{An optional specification to return a subset of Resolver rules, such as
all Resolver rules that are associated with the same Resolver endpoint.

If you submit a second or subsequent
\code{\link[=route53resolver_list_resolver_rules]{list_resolver_rules}} request and
specify the \code{NextToken} parameter, you must use the same values for
\code{Filters}, if any, as in the previous request.}
