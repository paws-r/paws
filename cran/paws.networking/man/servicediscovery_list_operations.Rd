\title{Lists operations that match the criteria that you specify}
\usage{
servicediscovery_list_operations(
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  Filters = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{NextToken}{For the first \code{\link[=servicediscovery_list_operations]{list_operations}}
request, omit this value.

If the response contains \code{NextToken}, submit another
\code{\link[=servicediscovery_list_operations]{list_operations}} request to get the
next group of results. Specify the value of \code{NextToken} from the
previous response in the next request.

Cloud Map gets \code{MaxResults} operations and then filters them based on
the specified criteria. It's possible that no operations in the first
\code{MaxResults} operations matched the specified criteria but that
subsequent groups of \code{MaxResults} operations do contain operations that
match the criteria.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of items that you want Cloud Map to return in the
response to a \code{\link[=servicediscovery_list_operations]{list_operations}}
request. If you don't specify a value for \code{MaxResults}, Cloud Map
returns up to 100 operations.}

\item{Filters}{A complex type that contains specifications for the operations that you
want to list, for example, operations that you started between a
specified start date and end date.

If you specify more than one filter, an operation must match all filters
to be returned by \code{\link[=servicediscovery_list_operations]{list_operations}}.}
