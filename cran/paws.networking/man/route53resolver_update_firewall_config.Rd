\title{Updates the configuration of the firewall behavior provided by DNS
Firewall for a single VPC from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)}
\usage{
route53resolver_update_firewall_config(ResourceId, FirewallFailOpen)
}
\arguments{
\item{ResourceId}{[required] The ID of the VPC that the configuration is for.}

\item{FirewallFailOpen}{[required] Determines how Route 53 Resolver handles queries during failures, for
example when all traffic that is sent to DNS Firewall fails to receive a
reply.
\itemize{
\item By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is
closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS
Firewall blocks queries that it is unable to evaluate properly.
\item If you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This approach
favors availability over security. DNS Firewall allows queries to
proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them.
}

This behavior is only enforced for VPCs that have at least one DNS
Firewall rule group association.}
