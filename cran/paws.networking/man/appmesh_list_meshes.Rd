\title{Returns a list of existing service meshes}
\usage{
appmesh_list_meshes(limit = NULL, nextToken = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{limit}{The maximum number of results returned by
\code{\link[=appmesh_list_meshes]{list_meshes}} in paginated output. When you use
this parameter, \code{\link[=appmesh_list_meshes]{list_meshes}} returns only
\code{limit} results in a single page along with a \code{nextToken} response
element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by
sending another \code{\link[=appmesh_list_meshes]{list_meshes}} request with the
returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you
don't use this parameter, \code{\link[=appmesh_list_meshes]{list_meshes}} returns
up to 100 results and a \code{nextToken} value if applicable.}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=appmesh_list_meshes]{list_meshes}} request where \code{limit} was used and
the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues
from the end of the previous results that returned the \code{nextToken}
value.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only
to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
purposes.}
