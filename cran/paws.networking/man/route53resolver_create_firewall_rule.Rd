the specified domain list}

  CreatorRequestId,
  FirewallRuleGroupId,
  FirewallDomainListId = NULL,
  Priority,
  Action,
  BlockResponse = NULL,
  BlockOverrideDomain = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{CreatorRequestId}{[required] A unique string that identifies the request and that allows you to retry
failed requests without the risk of running the operation twice.
\code{CreatorRequestId} can be any unique string, for example, a date/time
stamp.}

\item{FirewallRuleGroupId}{[required] The unique identifier of the firewall rule group where you want to
create the rule.}

\item{FirewallDomainListId}{The ID of the domain list that you want to use in the rule. Can't be
used together with \code{DnsThreatProtecton}.}

\item{Priority}{[required] The setting that determines the processing order of the rule in the rule
group. DNS Firewall processes the rules in a rule group by order of
priority, starting from the lowest setting.

You must specify a unique priority for each rule in a rule group. To
make it easier to insert rules later, leave space between the numbers,
for example, use 100, 200, and so on. You can change the priority
setting for the rules in a rule group at any time.}

\item{Action}{[required] The action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when it matches
one of the domains in the rule's domain list, or a threat in a DNS
Firewall Advanced rule:
\itemize{
\item \code{ALLOW} - Permit the request to go through. Not available for DNS
Firewall Advanced rules.
\item \code{ALERT} - Permit the request and send metrics and logs to Cloud
Watch.
\item \code{BLOCK} - Disallow the request. This option requires additional
details in the rule's \code{BlockResponse}.
}}

\item{BlockResponse}{The way that you want DNS Firewall to block the request, used with the
rule action setting \code{BLOCK}.
\itemize{
\item \code{NODATA} - Respond indicating that the query was successful, but no
response is available for it.
\item \code{NXDOMAIN} - Respond indicating that the domain name that's in the
query doesn't exist.
\item \code{OVERRIDE} - Provide a custom override in the response. This option
requires custom handling details in the rule's \verb{BlockOverride*}
settings.
}

This setting is required if the rule action setting is \code{BLOCK}.}

\item{BlockOverrideDomain}{The custom DNS record to send back in response to the query. Used for
the rule action \code{BLOCK} with a \code{BlockResponse} setting of \code{OVERRIDE}.

This setting is required if the \code{BlockResponse} setting is \code{OVERRIDE}.}

\item{BlockOverrideDnsType}{The DNS record's type. This determines the format of the record value
that you provided in \code{BlockOverrideDomain}. Used for the rule action
\code{BLOCK} with a \code{BlockResponse} setting of \code{OVERRIDE}.

This setting is required if the \code{BlockResponse} setting is \code{OVERRIDE}.}

\item{BlockOverrideTtl}{The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver or web
browser to cache the provided override record. Used for the rule action
\code{BLOCK} with a \code{BlockResponse} setting of \code{OVERRIDE}.

This setting is required if the \code{BlockResponse} setting is \code{OVERRIDE}.}

\item{Name}{[required] A name that lets you identify the rule in the rule group.}

\item{FirewallDomainRedirectionAction}{How you want the the rule to evaluate DNS redirection in the DNS
redirection chain, such as CNAME or DNAME.

\code{INSPECT_REDIRECTION_DOMAIN}: (Default) inspects all domains in the
redirection chain. The individual domains in the redirection chain must
be added to the domain list.

\code{TRUST_REDIRECTION_DOMAIN}: Inspects only the first domain in the
redirection chain. You don't need to add the subsequent domains in the
domain in the redirection list to the domain list.}

\item{Qtype}{The DNS query type you want the rule to evaluate. Allowed values are;
\itemize{
\item A: Returns an IPv4 address.
\item AAAA: Returns an Ipv6 address.
\item CAA: Restricts CAs that can create SSL/TLS certifications for the
domain.
\item CNAME: Returns another domain name.
\item DS: Record that identifies the DNSSEC signing key of a delegated
zone.
\item MX: Specifies mail servers.
\item NAPTR: Regular-expression-based rewriting of domain names.
\item NS: Authoritative name servers.
\item PTR: Maps an IP address to a domain name.
\item SOA: Start of authority record for the zone.
\item SPF: Lists the servers authorized to send emails from a domain.
\item SRV: Application specific values that identify servers.
\item TXT: Verifies email senders and application-specific values.
\item A query type you define by using the DNS type ID, for example 28 for
AAAA. The values must be defined as TYPENUMBER, where the NUMBER can
be 1-65334, for example, TYPE28. For more information, see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types}{List of DNS record types}.
}}

\item{DnsThreatProtection}{Use to create a DNS Firewall Advanced rule.}

\item{ConfidenceThreshold}{The confidence threshold for DNS Firewall Advanced. You must provide
this value when you create a DNS Firewall Advanced rule. The confidence
level values mean:
\itemize{
\item \code{LOW}: Provides the highest detection rate for threats, but also
increases false positives.
\item \code{MEDIUM}: Provides a balance between detecting threats and false
positives.
\item \code{HIGH}: Detects only the most well corroborated threats with a low
rate of false positives.
