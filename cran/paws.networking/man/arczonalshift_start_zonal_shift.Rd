\title{You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic away
from an Availability Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region, to help your
application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's bad
code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in
a single Availability Zone}
\usage{
arczonalshift_start_zonal_shift(
  awayFrom,
  comment,
  expiresIn,
  resourceIdentifier
)
}
\arguments{
\item{awayFrom}{[required] The Availability Zone (for example, \code{use1-az1}) that traffic is moved
away from for a resource when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal
shift expires or you cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead
moved to other Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.}

\item{comment}{[required] A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the latest comment
is retained; no comment history is maintained. A new comment overwrites
any existing comment string.}

\item{expiresIn}{[required] The length of time that you want a zonal shift to be active, which ARC
converts to an expiry time (expiration time). Zonal shifts are
temporary. You can set a zonal shift to be active initially for up to
three days (72 hours).

If you want to still keep traffic away from an Availability Zone, you
can update the zonal shift and set a new expiration. You can also cancel
a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're ready to
restore traffic to the Availability Zone.

To set a length of time for a zonal shift to be active, specify a whole
number, and then one of the following, with no space:
\itemize{
\item \strong{A lowercase letter m:} To specify that the value is in minutes.
\item \strong{A lowercase letter h:} To specify that the value is in hours.
}

For example: \verb{20h} means the zonal shift expires in 20 hours. \verb{120m}
means the zonal shift expires in 120 minutes (2 hours).}

\item{resourceIdentifier}{[required] The identifier for the resource that Amazon Web Services shifts traffic
for. The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

At this time, supported resources are Network Load Balancers and
Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off.}

\description{
You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic away from an Availability Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region, to help your application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone. You can start a zonal shift in ARC only for managed resources in your Amazon Web Services account in an Amazon Web Services Region. Resources are automatically registered with ARC by Amazon Web Services services.
