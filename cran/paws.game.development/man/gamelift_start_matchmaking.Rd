\usage{
gamelift_start_matchmaking(TicketId, ConfigurationName, Players)
}
\arguments{
\item{TicketId}{A unique identifier for a matchmaking ticket. If no ticket ID is
specified here, Amazon GameLift will generate one in the form of a UUID.
Use this identifier to track the matchmaking ticket status and retrieve
match results.}

\item{ConfigurationName}{[required] Name of the matchmaking configuration to use for this request.
Matchmaking configurations must exist in the same Region as this
request. You can use either the configuration name or ARN value.}

\item{Players}{[required] Information on each player to be matched. This information must include
a player ID, and may contain player attributes and latency data to be
used in the matchmaking process. After a successful match, \code{Player}
objects contain the name of the team the player is assigned to.}
}
\description{
Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on
custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players.
Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team
configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also
specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game
session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with
a single player or a group of players who want to play together.
FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match
type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined
in a \code{MatchmakingConfiguration}.
}
\details{
To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking
configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also
include a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking
configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with
status set to \code{QUEUED}. Track the status of the ticket to respond as
needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully
completed matches.

\strong{Tracking ticket status} \\-- A couple of options are available for
tracking the status of matchmaking requests:
\itemize{
\item Polling \\-- Call \code{DescribeMatchmaking}. This operation returns the
full ticket object, including current status and (for completed
tickets) game session connection info. We recommend polling no more
than once every 10 seconds.
\item Notifications \\-- Get event notifications for changes in ticket
status using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). Notifications
are easy to set up (see CreateMatchmakingConfiguration) and
typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently
than polling. We recommend that you use polling to back up to
notifications (since delivery is not guaranteed) and call
\code{DescribeMatchmaking} only when notifications are not received
within 30 seconds.
}

\strong{Processing a matchmaking request} \\-- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking
request as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Your client code submits a \code{StartMatchmaking} request for one or
more players and tracks the status of the request ticket.
\item FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an
acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets
in the proposed match are advanced to the next status.
\item If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking
configuration), the tickets move into status \code{REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE}.
This status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all
players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call
AcceptMatch for each player. If any player rejects or fails to
accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is
dropped (see \code{AcceptMatch} for more details).
\item Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move
into status \code{PLACING}. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game
session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking
configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data.
\item When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move
into \code{COMPLETED} status. Connection information (including game
session endpoint and player session) is added to the matchmaking
tickets. Matched players can use the connection information to join
the game.
