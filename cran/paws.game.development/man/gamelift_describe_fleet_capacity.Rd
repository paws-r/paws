\title{Retrieves the current status of fleet capacity for one or more fleets}
\usage{
gamelift_describe_fleet_capacity(FleetIds, Limit, NextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetIds}{A unique identifier for a fleet(s) to retrieve capacity information for.
You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.}

\item{Limit}{The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with
\code{NextToken} to get results as a set of sequential pages. This parameter
is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.}

\item{NextToken}{Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results.
Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To
start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value. This
parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet
IDs.}
}
\description{
Retrieves the current status of fleet capacity for one or more fleets.
This information includes the number of instances that have been
requested for the fleet and the number currently active. You can request
capacity for all fleets, or specify a list of one or more fleet IDs.
When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to
retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a
FleetCapacity object is returned for each requested fleet ID. When
specifying a list of fleet IDs, attribute objects are returned only for
fleets that currently exist.
}
\details{
Some API actions may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one
request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the
error message includes the maximum allowed.
