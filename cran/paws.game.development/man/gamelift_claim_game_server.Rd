\arguments{
\item{GameServerGroupName}{[required] An identifier for the game server group. When claiming a specific game
server, this is the game server group whether the game server is
located. When requesting that GameLift FleetIQ locate an available game
server, this is the game server group to search on. You can use either
the GameServerGroup name or ARN value.}

\item{GameServerId}{A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server to claim. If
this parameter is left empty, GameLift FleetIQ searches for an available
game server in the specified game server group.}

\item{GameServerData}{A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string
value, to be passed to the claimed game server.}

\details{
Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host
gameplay and players. This action is called by a game client or client
service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new
game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ searches for an available
game server in the specified game server group, places the game server
in \"claimed\" status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information
back to the requester so that players can connect to the game server.

There are two ways you can claim a game server. For the first option,
you provide a game server group ID only, which prompts GameLift FleetIQ
to search for an available game server in the specified group and claim
it. With this option, GameLift FleetIQ attempts to consolidate gameplay
on as few instances as possible to minimize hosting costs. For the
second option, you request a specific game server by its ID. This option
results in a less efficient claiming process because it does not take
advantage of consolidation and may fail if the requested game server is
unavailable.

To claim a game server, identify a game server group and (optionally) a
game server ID. If your game requires that game data be provided to the
game server at the start of a game, such as a game map or player
information, you can provide it in your claim request.

When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is
returned. A claimed game server\'s utilization status remains AVAILABLE,
while the claim status is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time
period allows the game server to be prompted to update its status to
UTILIZED (using UpdateGameServer). If the game server\'s status is not
updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status
and is available to be claimed by another request.

If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in
the following cases: (1) if the game server utilization status is
UTILIZED, (2) if the game server claim status is CLAIMED, or (3) if the
instance that the game server is running on is flagged as draining.
