Adds a player to a game session and creates a player session record.
Before a player can be added, a game session must have an \code{ACTIVE}
status, have a creation policy of \code{ALLOW_ALL}, and have an open player
slot. To add a group of players to a game session, use
CreatePlayerSessions.
}

To create a player session, specify a game session ID, player ID, and
optionally a string of player data. If successful, the player is added
to the game session and a new PlayerSession object is returned. Player
sessions cannot be updated.
