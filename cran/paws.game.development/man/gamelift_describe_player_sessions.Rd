\description{
Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions. This action can be
used in several ways: (1) provide a \code{PlayerSessionId} to request
properties for a specific player session; (2) provide a \code{GameSessionId}
to request properties for all player sessions in the specified game
session; (3) provide a \code{PlayerId} to request properties for all player
sessions of a specified player.
}
\details{
To get game session record(s), specify only one of the following: a
player session ID, a game session ID, or a player ID. You can filter
this request by player session status. Use the pagination parameters to
retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a
PlayerSession object is returned for each session matching the request.
