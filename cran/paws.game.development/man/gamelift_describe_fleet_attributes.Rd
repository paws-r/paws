\title{Retrieves core properties, including configuration, status, and
metadata, for a fleet}
\usage{
gamelift_describe_fleet_attributes(FleetIds, Limit, NextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetIds}{A list of unique fleet identifiers to retrieve attributes for. You can
use either the fleet ID or ARN value. To retrieve attributes for all
current fleets, do not include this parameter. If the list of fleet
identifiers includes fleets that don't currently exist, the request
succeeds but no attributes for that fleet are returned.}

\item{Limit}{The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with
\code{NextToken} to get results as a set of sequential pages. This parameter
is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.}

\item{NextToken}{Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results.
Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To
start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value. This
parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet
IDs.}

\description{
Retrieves core properties, including configuration, status, and
metadata, for a fleet.
}
\details{
To get attributes for one or more fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or
fleet ARNs. To get attributes for all fleets, do not specify a fleet
identifier. When requesting attributes for multiple fleets, use the
pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
If successful, a FleetAttributes object is returned for each fleet
requested, unless the fleet identifier is not found.

Some API actions may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one
request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the
error message includes the maximum allowed number.
