\description{
\strong{This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and
game server groups.}

Reinstates activity on a game server group after it has been suspended.
A game server group might be suspended by
the\code{\link[=gamelift_suspend_game_server_group]{suspend_game_server_group}}
operation, or it might be suspended involuntarily due to a configuration
problem. In the second case, you can manually resume activity on the
group once the configuration problem has been resolved. Refer to the
game server group status and status reason for more information on why
group activity is suspended.

To resume activity, specify a game server group ARN and the type of
activity to be resumed. If successful, a GameServerGroup object is
returned showing that the resumed activity is no longer listed in
\code{SuspendedActions}.
