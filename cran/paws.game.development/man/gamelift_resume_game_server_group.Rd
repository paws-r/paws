Reinstates activity on a game server group after it has been suspended.
A game server group may be suspended by calling SuspendGameServerGroup,
or it may have been involuntarily suspended due to a configuration
problem. You can manually resume activity on the group once the
configuration problem has been resolved. Refer to the game server group
status and status reason for more information on why group activity is
suspended.
