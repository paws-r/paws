\usage{
gamelift_describe_scaling_policies(FleetId, StatusFilter, Limit,
  NextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{FleetId}{[required] A unique identifier for a fleet to retrieve scaling policies for. You
can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.}

\item{StatusFilter}{Scaling policy status to filter results on. A scaling policy is only in
force when in an \code{ACTIVE} status.
\itemize{
\item \strong{ACTIVE} \\-- The scaling policy is currently in force.
\item \strong{UPDATEREQUESTED} \\-- A request to update the scaling policy has
been received.
\item \strong{UPDATING} \\-- A change is being made to the scaling policy.
\item \strong{DELETEREQUESTED} \\-- A request to delete the scaling policy has
been received.
\item \strong{DELETING} \\-- The scaling policy is being deleted.
\item \strong{DELETED} \\-- The scaling policy has been deleted.
\item \strong{ERROR} \\-- An error occurred in creating the policy. It should be
removed and recreated.
}}

\item{Limit}{The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with
\code{NextToken} to get results as a set of sequential pages.}

\item{NextToken}{Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results.
Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To
start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.}

\description{
Retrieves all scaling policies applied to a fleet.
}
\details{
To get a fleet\'s scaling policies, specify the fleet ID. You can filter
this request by policy status, such as to retrieve only active scaling
policies. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of
sequential pages. If successful, set of ScalingPolicy objects is
returned for the fleet.

A fleet may have all of its scaling policies suspended
(StopFleetActions). This action does not affect the status of the
scaling policies, which remains ACTIVE. To see whether a fleet\'s
scaling policies are in force or suspended, call DescribeFleetAttributes
and check the stopped actions.
