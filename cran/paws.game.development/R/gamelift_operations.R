#' Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch
#' match
#'
#' Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch
#' match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so,
#' then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless
#' all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.
#' 
#' When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in
#' the proposed match are placed into status `REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`. This is
#' a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the
#' ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this
#' status; all other acceptances result in an error.
#' 
#' To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or
#' more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the
#' matchmaking tickets advance to status `PLACING`, where a new game
#' session is created for the match.
#' 
#' If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received
#' before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The
#' matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets
#' where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is
#' returned to `SEARCHING` to find a new match. For tickets where one or
#' more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to `CANCELLED`,
#' and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these
#' players can be submitted as needed.

#'
#' **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and
#' game server groups.**
#' 
#' Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host
#' gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or
#' client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a
#' new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an available
#' game server, places it in `CLAIMED` status for 60 seconds, and returns
#' connection information that players can use to connect to the game
#' server.
#' 
#' To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also
#' specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift
#' FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to
#' the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or
#' player information.
#' 
#' When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is
#' returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains `AVAILABLE`
#' while the claim status is set to `CLAIMED` for up to 60 seconds. This
#' time period gives the game server time to update its status to
#' `UTILIZED` (using UpdateGameServer) once players join. If the game
#' server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server
#' reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another
#' request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable.
#' 
#' If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in
#' the following cases:
#' 
#' -   If the game server utilization status is `UTILIZED`.
#' 
#' -   If the game server claim status is `CLAIMED`.
#' 
#' When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if
#' the game server is running on an instance in `DRAINING` status. To avoid
#' this, first check the instance status by calling
#' DescribeGameServerInstances.

#' Creates an alias for a fleet
#'
#' Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias
#' ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for
#' a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to
#' another, such as when updating your game build.
#' 
#' Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases:
#' simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A
#' terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of
#' routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a
#' terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want
#' to direct players to an upgrade site.
#' 
#' To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and
#' optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but
#' a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is
#' returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to
#' another fleet by calling `UpdateAlias`.

#' Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary
#' files
#'
#' Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary
#' files. Game server binaries must be combined into a zip file for use
#' with Amazon GameLift.
#' 
#' When setting up a new game build for GameLift, we recommend using the
#' AWS CLI command
#' **[upload-build](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html)**
#' . This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build
#' files from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it
#' creates a new build resource.
#' 
#' The `CreateBuild` operation can used in the following scenarios:
#' 
#' -   To create a new game build with build files that are in an S3
#'     location under an AWS account that you control. To use this option,
#'     you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the S3 bucket. With
#'     permissions in place, call `CreateBuild` and specify a build name,
#'     operating system, and the S3 storage location of your game build.
#' 
#' -   To directly upload your build files to a GameLift S3 location. To
#'     use this option, first call `CreateBuild` and specify a build name
#'     and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource
#'     and also returns an S3 location with temporary access credentials.
#'     Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the
#'     specified S3 location. For more information, see [Uploading
#'     Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html)
#'     in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*. Build files can be uploaded to
#'     the GameLift S3 location once only; that can't be updated.
#' 
#' If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique
#' build ID and places it in `INITIALIZED` status. A build must be in
#' `READY` status before you can create fleets with it.

#' Creates a new fleet to run your game servers
#'
#' Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. whether they are custom
#' game builds or Realtime Servers with game-specific script. A fleet is a
#' set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of
#' which can host multiple game sessions. When creating a fleet, you choose
#' the hardware specifications, set some configuration options, and specify
#' the game server to deploy on the new fleet.
#' 
#' To create a new fleet, provide the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) an
#' EC2 instance type and fleet type (spot or on-demand), (3) the build ID
#' for your game build or script ID if using Realtime Servers, and (4) a
#' runtime configuration, which determines how game servers will run on
#' each instance in the fleet.
#' 
#' If the `CreateFleet` call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the
#' following tasks. You can track the process of a fleet by checking the
#' fleet status or by monitoring fleet creation events:
#' 
#' -   Creates a fleet resource. Status: `NEW`.
#' 
#' -   Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed
#'     in the Amazon GameLift console.
#' 
#' -   Sets the fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which
#'     triggers Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.
#' 
#' -   Downloads the game build or Realtime script to the new instance and
#'     installs it. Statuses: `DOWNLOADING`, `VALIDATING`, `BUILDING`.
#' 
#' -   Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is
#'     configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon
#'     GameLift staggers each process launch by a few seconds. Status:
#'     `ACTIVATING`.
#' 
#' -   Sets the fleet's status to `ACTIVE` as soon as one server process is
#'     ready to host a game session.

#' @param ServerLaunchParameters This parameter is no longer used. Instead, specify server launch
#' parameters in the `RuntimeConfiguration` parameter. (Requests that
#' specify a server launch path and launch parameters instead of a runtime
#' configuration will continue to work.)
#' @param LogPaths This parameter is no longer used. Instead, to specify where Amazon
#' GameLift should store log files once a server process shuts down, use
#' the Amazon GameLift server API `ProcessReady()` and specify one or more
#' directory paths in `logParameters`. See more information in the [Server
#' API
#' Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/#gamelift-sdk-server-api-ref-dataypes-process).
#' @param EC2InstanceType &#91;required&#93; The name of an EC2 instance type that is supported in Amazon GameLift. A
#' fleet instance type determines the computing resources of each instance
#' in the fleet, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
#' Amazon GameLift supports the following EC2 instance types. See [Amazon
#' EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for
#' detailed descriptions.
#' @param EC2InboundPermissions Range of IP addresses and port settings that permit inbound traffic to
#' access game sessions that are running on the fleet. For fleets using a
#' custom game build, this parameter is required before game sessions
#' running on the fleet can accept connections. For Realtime Servers
#' fleets, Amazon GameLift automatically sets TCP and UDP ranges for use by
#' the Realtime servers. You can specify multiple permission settings or
#' add more by updating the fleet.
#' @param NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy A game session protection policy to apply to all instances in this
#' fleet. If this parameter is not set, instances in this fleet default to
#' no protection. You can change a fleet's protection policy using
#' UpdateFleetAttributes, but this change will only affect sessions created
#' after the policy change. You can also set protection for individual
#' instances using UpdateGameSession.
#' 
#' -   **NoProtection** - The game session can be terminated during a
#'     scale-down event.
#' 
#' -   **FullProtection** - If the game session is in an `ACTIVE` status,
#'     it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
#' @param RuntimeConfiguration Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the
#' fleet. Server processes run either a custom game build executable or a
#' Realtime script. The runtime configuration defines the server
#' executables or launch script file, launch parameters, and the number of
#' processes to run concurrently on each instance. When creating a fleet,
#' the runtime configuration must have at least one server process
#' configuration; otherwise the request fails with an invalid request
#' exception. (This parameter replaces the parameters `ServerLaunchPath`
#' and `ServerLaunchParameters`, although requests that contain values for
#' these parameters instead of a runtime configuration will continue to
#' work.) This parameter is required unless the parameters
#' `ServerLaunchPath` and `ServerLaunchParameters` are defined. Runtime
#' configuration replaced these parameters, but fleets that use them will
#' continue to work.
#' @param ResourceCreationLimitPolicy A policy that limits the number of game sessions an individual player
#' can create over a span of time for this fleet.
#' @param MetricGroups The name of an Amazon CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A
#' metric group aggregates the metrics for all fleets in the group. Specify
#' an existing metric group name, or provide a new name to create a new
#' metric group. A fleet can only be included in one metric group at a
#' time.
#' @param PeerVpcAwsAccountId A unique identifier for the AWS account with the VPC that you want to
#' peer your Amazon GameLift fleet with. You can find your account ID in
#' the AWS Management Console under account settings.
#' @param PeerVpcId A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your
#' Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet.
#' To look up a VPC ID, use the [VPC
#' Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home) in the AWS
#' Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in [VPC Peering with
#' Amazon GameLift
#' Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html).
#' @param FleetType Indicates whether to use On-Demand instances or Spot instances for this
#' fleet. If empty, the default is `ON_DEMAND`. Both categories of
#' instances use identical hardware and configurations based on the
#' instance type selected for this fleet. Learn more about [On-Demand
#' versus Spot
#' Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-ec2-instances.html#gamelift-ec2-instances-spot).
#' @param InstanceRoleArn A unique identifier for an AWS IAM role that manages access to your AWS
#' services. Fleets with an instance role ARN allow applications that are
#' running on the fleet's instances to assume the role. Learn more about
#' using on-box credentials for your game servers at [Access external
#' resources from a game
#' server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-resources.html).

#' PassRole permissions. See [IAM policy examples for
#' GameLift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-iam-policy-examples.html).
#' @param CertificateConfiguration Indicates whether to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the new fleet.
#' TLS certificates are used for encrypting traffic between game clients
#' and game servers running on GameLift. If this parameter is not
#' specified, the default value, DISABLED, is used. This fleet setting

#' **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and
#' game server groups.**
#' 
#' Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting
#' on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting. This operation
#' creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS
#' account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the
#' status of your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game server
#' group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.
#' 
#' Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:
#' 
#' -   An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon
#'     EC2 instances with your game server build. For more information, see
#'     [Launching an Instance from a Launch
#'     Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html)
#'     in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
#' 
#' -   An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow
#'     GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group.
#'     For more information, see [Create IAM roles for cross-service
#'     interaction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html)
#'     in the *GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role
#' and Amazon EC2 launch template, and provide a list of instance types
#' that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and
#' minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an
#' Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ
#' metric.
#' 
#' Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are
#' created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's
#' configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a
#' game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling
#' policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group.
#' Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically
#' updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to
#' optimize for availability and cost.

#'   BalancingStrategy, GameServerProtectionPolicy, VpcSubnets, Tags)
#'
#' @param GameServerGroupName &#91;required&#93; An identifier for the new game server group. This value is used to
#' generate unique ARN identifiers for the EC2 Auto Scaling group and the
#' GameLift FleetIQ game server group. The name must be unique per Region
#' per AWS account.
#' @param RoleArn &#91;required&#93; The Amazon Resource Name
#' ([ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
#' for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto
#' Scaling groups.
#' @param MinSize &#91;required&#93; The minimum number of instances allowed in the EC2 Auto Scaling group.
#' During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale
#' down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be
#' set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this
#' value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
#' @param MaxSize &#91;required&#93; The maximum number of instances allowed in the EC2 Auto Scaling group.
#' During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale
#' up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is
#' created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the
#' AWS console or APIs.
#' @param LaunchTemplate &#91;required&#93; The EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game
#' server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group.
#' You can specify the template using either the template name or ID. For
#' help with creating a launch template, see [Creating a Launch Template
#' for an Auto Scaling
#' Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html)
#' in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*. After the Auto Scaling
#' group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group
#' using the AWS console or APIs.
#' @param InstanceDefinitions &#91;required&#93; The EC2 instance types and sizes to use in the Auto Scaling group. The
#' instance definitions must specify at least two different instance types
#' that are supported by GameLift FleetIQ. For more information on instance
#' types, see [EC2 Instance
#' Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html)
#' in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*. You can optionally specify capacity
#' weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an
#' instance type, it is set to the default value "1". For more information
#' about capacity weighting, see [Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto
#' Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html)
#' in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
#' @param AutoScalingPolicy Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling
#' group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the
#' metric `"PercentUtilizedGameServers"` to maintain a buffer of idle game
#' servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players. After
#' the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the
#' Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
#' @param BalancingStrategy Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and
#' On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   `SPOT_ONLY` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group.
#'     If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting,
#'     the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot
#'     Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are
#'     started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
#'     (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
#' 
#' -   `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever
#'     available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
#'     unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting
#'     capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable
#'     Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are
#'     replaced with new On-Demand Instances.
#' 
#' -   `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
#'     server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while
#'     this balancing strategy is in force.
#' @param GameServerProtectionPolicy A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are
#' protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active
#' game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event,
#' causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot
#' be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the
#' event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to
#' this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless
#' of protection status. This property is set to `NO_PROTECTION` by
#' default.
#' @param VpcSubnets A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances in
#' the game server group. By default, all GameLift FleetIQ-supported
#' Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify VPCs
#' that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the game
#' server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group will
#' always use the property value that is set with this request, even if the
#' Auto Scaling group is updated directly.
#' @param Tags A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags
#' are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources is useful
#' for resource management, access management, and cost allocation. For
#' more information, see [Tagging AWS
#' Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html)
#' in the *AWS General Reference*. Once the resource is created, you can
#' use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove,
#' and view tags, respectively. The maximum tag limit may be lower than
#' stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.

#' Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This operation creates a
#' game session record and assigns an available server process in the
#' specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an `ACTIVE`
#' status before a game session can be created in it.
#' 
#' To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and

#' can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game
#' session. If successful, a GameSession object is returned containing the
#' game session properties and other settings you specified.
#' 
#' **Idempotency tokens.** You can add a token that uniquely identifies
#' game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session
#' requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency
#' token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original

#' 
#' **Resource creation limits.** If you are creating a game session on a
#' fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must
#' specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to

#' Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game
#' sessions
#'
#' Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game
#' sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by
#' specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how long
#' requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue
#' to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple Regions. To add
#' placement requests to a queue, call StartGameSessionPlacement and
#' reference the queue name.
#' 
#' **Destination order.** When processing a request for a game session,
#' Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with
#' available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default
#' order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is
#' overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency
#' information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to
#' prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency,
#' as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players
#' will have the best possible gameplay experience.
#' 
#' **Player latency policies.** For placement requests containing player
#' latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual
#' players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a
#' destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not
#' placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a
#' policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are
#' enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency

#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; A descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue
#' names must be unique within each Region.
#' @param TimeoutInSeconds The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request
#' remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session
#' placement changes to a `TIMED_OUT` status.
#' @param PlayerLatencyPolicies A collection of latency policies to apply when processing game sessions
#' placement requests with player latency information. Multiple policies
#' are evaluated in order of the maximum latency value, starting with the
#' lowest latency values. With just one policy, the policy is enforced at
#' the start of the game session placement for the duration period. With
#' multiple policies, each policy is enforced consecutively for its
#' duration period. For example, a queue might enforce a 60-second policy
#' followed by a 120-second policy, and then no policy for the remainder of
#' the placement. A player latency policy must set a value for
#' `MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds`. If none is set, this API
#' request fails.
#' @param Destinations A list of fleets that can be used to fulfill game session placement
#' requests in the queue. Fleets are identified by either a fleet ARN or a
#' fleet alias ARN. Destinations are listed in default preference order.

#' Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch
#'
#' Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether
#' your are using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a standalone
#' matchmaking service, the matchmaking configuration sets out rules for
#' matching players and forming teams. If you're also using GameLift
#' hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your
#' matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different
#' game scenarios. All matchmaking requests (StartMatchmaking or
#' StartMatchBackfill) identify the matchmaking configuration to use and
#' provide player attributes consistent with that configuration.
#' 
#' To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following:
#' configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without GameLift
#' hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players and find
#' acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the
#' maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch
#' with GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue
#' to use when starting a game session for the match.
#' 
#' In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
#' to receive matchmaking notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the
#' matchmaking configuration. An alternative method, continuously polling
#' ticket status with DescribeMatchmaking, is only suitable for games in
#' development with low matchmaking usage.

#'
#' @param Name &#91;required&#93; A unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration. This name is used
#' to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking request or
#' ticket.
#' @param Description A human-readable description of the matchmaking configuration.
#' @param GameSessionQueueArns Amazon Resource Name
#' ([ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html))
#' that is assigned to a GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely
#' identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Queues can be located
#' in any Region. Queues are used to start new GameLift-hosted game
#' sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking
#' configuration. If `FlexMatchMode` is set to `STANDALONE`, do not set
#' this parameter.
#' @param RequestTimeoutSeconds &#91;required&#93; The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain
#' in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can
#' be resubmitted as needed.
#' @param AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed
#' match, if acceptance is required. If any player rejects the match or
#' fails to accept before the timeout, the tickets are returned to the
#' ticket pool and continue to be evaluated for an acceptable match.
#' @param AcceptanceRequired &#91;required&#93; A flag that determines whether a match that was created with this
#' configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require
#' acceptance, set to `TRUE`. With this option enabled, matchmaking tickets
#' use the status `REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE` to indicate when a completed
#' potential match is waiting for player acceptance.
#' @param RuleSetName &#91;required&#93; A unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this
#' configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A
#' matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the
#' same Region.
#' @param NotificationTarget An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications.
#' @param AdditionalPlayerCount The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players.
#' For example, assume that the configuration's rule set specifies a match
#' for a single 12-person team. If the additional player count is set to 2,
#' only 10 players are initially selected for the match. This parameter is
#' not used if `FlexMatchMode` is set to `STANDALONE`.
#' @param CustomEventData Information to be added to all events related to this matchmaking
#' configuration.
#' @param GameProperties A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key-value
#' pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process in the
#' GameSession object with a request to start a new game session (see
#' [Start a Game
#' Session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession)).
#' This information is added to the new GameSession object that is created
#' for a successful match. This parameter is not used if `FlexMatchMode` is
#' set to `STANDALONE`.
#' @param GameSessionData A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string
#' value. This data is passed to a game server process in the GameSession
#' object with a request to start a new game session (see [Start a Game
#' Session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession)).
#' This information is added to the new GameSession object that is created
#' for a successful match. This parameter is not used if `FlexMatchMode` is
#' set to `STANDALONE`.
#' @param BackfillMode The method used to backfill game sessions that are created with this
#' matchmaking configuration. Specify `MANUAL` when your game manages
#' backfill requests manually or does not use the match backfill feature.
#' Specify `AUTOMATIC` to have GameLift create a StartMatchBackfill request
#' whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more about
#' manual and automatic backfill in [Backfill Existing Games with
#' FlexMatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html).
#' Automatic backfill is not available when `FlexMatchMode` is set to
#' `STANDALONE`.
#' @param FlexMatchMode Indicates whether this matchmaking configuration is being used with
#' GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking solution.
#' 
#' -   **STANDALONE** - FlexMatch forms matches and returns match
#'     information, including players and team assignments, in a
#'     [MatchmakingSucceeded](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html#match-events-matchmakingsucceeded)
#'     event.
#' 
#' -   **WITH\\_QUEUE** - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified
#'     GameLift queue to start a game session for the match.
#' @param Tags A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking configuration

#' Creates a new script record for your Realtime Servers script
#'
#' Creates a new script record for your Realtime Servers script. Realtime

#' custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when you create
#' a Realtime Servers fleet to host your game sessions. Script logic is
#' executed during an active game session.
#' 
#' To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the
#' script file(s). The script files and all dependencies must be zipped
#' into a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these
#' locations:
#' 
#' -   A locally available directory. Use the *ZipFile* parameter for this
#'     option.
#' 
#' -   An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your AWS
#'     account. Use the *StorageLocation* parameter for this option. You'll
#'     need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows
#'     the Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.
#' 
#' If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique
#' script ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is

#' 
#' When using the AWS CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to

#' information, see [Tagging AWS
#' Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html)
#' in the *AWS General Reference*. Once the resource is created, you can
#' use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove,
#' and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the
#' AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.

#' Requests authorization to create or delete a peer connection between the

#' To request authorization to create a connection, call this operation
#' from the AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer to your Amazon
#' GameLift fleet. For example, to enable your game servers to retrieve
#' data from a DynamoDB table, use the account that manages that DynamoDB
#' resource. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the VPC that you
#' want to peer with, and (2) the ID of the AWS account that you use to

#' Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server
#' group record. You have several options for how these resources are
#' impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of
#' delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources:
#' 
#' -   The game server group
#' 
#' -   The corresponding Auto Scaling group
#' 
#' -   All game servers that are currently running in the group
#' 
#' To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete
#' and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups
#' can only be deleted if they are in `ACTIVE` or `ERROR` status.
#' 
#' If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked
#' off. The game server group status is changed to `DELETE_SCHEDULED`,
#' which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops
#' automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server
#' group are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources.
#' If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in

#' Requests remote access to a fleet instance
#'
#' Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for
#' debugging, gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity in real
#' time.
#' 
#' To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the
#' operating system of the instance. For a Windows instance, Amazon
#' GameLift returns a user name and password as strings for use with a
#' Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, Amazon GameLift
#' returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with
#' an SSH client. The private key must be saved in the proper format to a
#' `.pem` file before using. If you're making this request using the AWS
#' CLI, saving the secret can be handled as part of the GetInstanceAccess
#' request, as shown in one of the examples for this operation.
#' 
#' To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the
#' instance and the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve a fleet's
#' instance IDs by calling DescribeInstances. If successful, an
#' InstanceAccess object is returned that contains the instance's IP
#' address and a set of credentials.

#' Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet
#'
#' Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are
#' used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player
#' demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a
#' fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a
#' certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies:
#' target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and
#' efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used.
#' Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over
#' auto-scaling.
#' 
#' Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the
#' same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple
#' rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however,
#' because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.
#' 
#' You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling
#' StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO\\_SCALING. To resume scaling
#' policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet action. To stop
#' just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete
#' the policy with DeleteScalingPolicy.
#' 
#' Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in [Set Up Fleet
#' Automatic
#' Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html).
#' 
#' **Target-based policy**
#' 
#' A target-based policy tracks a single metric:
#' PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's
#' hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in
#' use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player
#' demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a
#' target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to
#' Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that
#' target.
#' 
#' For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that
#' has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy
#' tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available
#' capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift
#' will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to
#' the 10% buffer.
#' 
#' To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name,
#' and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track
#' (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration
#' object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On
#' a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is
#' automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the
#' fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy
#' will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.
#' 
#' **Rule-based policy**
#' 
#' A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold
#' value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With
#' a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet
#' metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by
#' how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.
#' 
#' For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the
#' percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15
#' minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%."
#' 
#' A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
#' 
#' If `\\[MetricName\\]` is `\\[ComparisonOperator\\]` `\\[Threshold\\]`
#' for `\\[EvaluationPeriods\\]` minutes, then
#' `\\[ScalingAdjustmentType\\]` to/by `\\[ScalingAdjustment\\]`.
#' 
#' To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
#' 
#' If `\\[PercentIdleInstances\\]` is `\\[GreaterThanThreshold\\]`
#' `\\[20\\]` for `\\[15\\]` minutes, then `\\[PercentChangeInCapacity\\]`
#' to/by `\\[10\\]`.
#' 
#' To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of
#' name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the
#' parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request,
#' the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force
#' as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling
#' actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once
#' the fleet actions are restarted.

#'     adjustment value.
#' 
#' -   **PercentChangeInCapacity** -- increase or reduce the current
#'     instance count by the scaling adjustment, read as a percentage.
#'     Positive values scale up while negative values scale down; for

#' Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift FleetIQ that
#' the game server is ready to host gameplay and players. This operation is
#' called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game
#' server group. Registering game servers enables GameLift FleetIQ to track

#' game server for a new game session.
#' 
#' To register a game server, identify the game server group and instance
#' where the game server is running, and provide a unique identifier for
#' the game server. You can also include connection and game server data.
#' When a game client or service requests a game server by calling
#' ClaimGameServer, this information is returned in the response.
#' 
#' Once a game server is successfully registered, it is put in status
#' `AVAILABLE`. A request to register a game server may fail if the

#' Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria

#' 
#' -   **gameSessionName** -- Name assigned to a game session. This value
#'     is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or
#'     updating with UpdateGameSession. Game session names do not need to
#'     be unique to a game session.
#' 
#' -   **gameSessionProperties** -- Custom data defined in a game session's
#'     `GameProperty` parameter. `GameProperty` values are stored as
#'     key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a
#'     string to search the data values for. For example, to search for
#'     game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair
#'     "gameMode:brawl", specify the following:
#'     `gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl"`. All custom data values
#'     are searched as strings.
#' 
#' -   **maximumSessions** -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for
#'     a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session
#'     with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession.
#' 
#' -   **creationTimeMillis** -- Value indicating when a game session was
#'     created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.
#' 
#' -   **playerSessionCount** -- Number of players currently connected to a
#'     game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session
#'     or drop out.
#' 
#' -   **hasAvailablePlayerSessions** -- Boolean value indicating whether a
#'     game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly
#'     recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute
#'     to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players
#'     can join.
#' 
#' Returned values for `playerSessionCount` and
#' `hasAvailablePlayerSessions` change quickly as players join sessions and

#' active game sessions. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value. Each
#' request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.
#' @param FilterExpression String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no
#' filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game
#' sessions in the fleet that are in `ACTIVE` status.
#' 
#' A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each
#' condition consists of the following:
#' 
#' -   **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are
#'     `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`,
#'     `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`,
#'     `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
#' 
#' -   **Comparator** -- Valid comparators are: `=`, `&lt;&gt;`, `&lt;`,
#'     `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=`.
#' 
#' -   **Value** -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers,
#'     boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand.
#'     String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single
#'     quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string
#'     values can only be used with the comparators `=` and `&lt;&gt;`. For
#'     example, the following filter expression searches on
#'     `gameSessionName`:
#'     "`FilterExpression\": \"gameSessionName = \'Matt\\\'s Awesome Game 1\'\"`.
#' 
#' To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical
#' keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` and parentheses as needed. For example:
#' `x AND y AND NOT z`, `NOT (x OR y)`.
#' 
#' Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the
#' following precedence rules:
#' 
#' 1.  `=`, `&lt;&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=`
#' 
#' 2.  Parentheses
#' 
#' 3.  NOT
#' 
#' 4.  AND
#' 
#' 5.  OR
#' 
#' For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at
#' least ten players that have an open player slot:
#' `"maximumSessions&gt;=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"`.
#' @param SortExpression Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is
#' included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression
#' consists of the following elements:
#' 
#' -   **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are
#'     `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`,
#'     `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`,
#'     `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
#' 
#' -   **Order** -- Valid sort orders are `ASC` (ascending) and `DESC`
#'     (descending).
#' 
#' For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions
#' first: `"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"`. Results with a null
#' value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.
#' @param Limit The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with
#' `NextToken` to get results as a set of sequential pages. The maximum
#' number of results returned is 20, even if this value is not set or is
#' set higher than 20.
#' @param NextToken Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results.
#' Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation.
#' To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.

#' Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see
#' CreateGameSessionQueue)
#'
#' Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see
#' CreateGameSessionQueue). When processing a placement request, Amazon
#' GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations,
#' scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times
#' out.
#' 
#' A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When
#' a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a
#' player session for each player included in the request.
#' 
#' When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet
#' in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a
#' queue's destinations are listed in preference order.
#' 
#' Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also
#' provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data
#' indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a
#' fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the
#' list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal
#' lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift
#' calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get
#' the best game play across all players.
#' 
#' To place a new game session request, specify the following:
#' 
#' -   The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings
#' 
#' -   A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to
#'     track the status of the placement request
#' 
#' -   (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each
#'     player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is
#'     optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID
#'     for each player)
#' 
#' -   Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for
#'     the players)
#' 
#' If successful, a new game session placement is created.
#' 
#' To track the status of a placement request, call
#' DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request's status. If the
#' status is `FULFILLED`, a new game session has been created and a game
#' session ARN and Region are referenced. If the placement request times
#' out, you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different queue.

#' Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session
#'
#' Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This
#' operation can be used to add players to matched games that start with
#' fewer than the maximum number of players or to replace players when they
#' drop out. By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create the
#' original match, you ensure that new players meet the match criteria and
#' maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You can
#' backfill a match anytime after a game session has been created.
#' 
#' To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing
#' game session's ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that
#' describes all current players in the game session. If successful, a
#' match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED.
#' The ticket is placed in the matchmaker's ticket pool and processed.
#' Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed.
#' 
#' The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to the
#' initial matchmaking process. The matchmaker searches the pool and groups
#' tickets together to form potential matches, allowing only one backfill
#' ticket per potential match. Once the a match is formed, the matchmaker
#' creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in the match
#' are updated with the game session's connection information, and the
#' GameSession object is updated to include matchmaker data on the new
#' players. For more detail on how match backfill requests are processed,

#'
#' Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on
#' custom matchmaking rules. If you're also using GameLift hosting, a new
#' game session is started for the matched players. Each matchmaking
#' request identifies one or more players to find a match for, and
#' specifies the type of match to build, including the team configuration
#' and the rules for an acceptable match. When a matchmaking request
#' identifies a group of players who want to play together, FlexMatch finds
#' additional players to fill the match. Match type, rules, and other
#' features are defined in a `MatchmakingConfiguration`.
#' 
#' To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking
#' configuration, and include the players to be matched. For each player,
#' you must also include the player attribute values that are required by
#' the matchmaking configuration (in the rule set). If successful, a
#' matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to `QUEUED`.
#' 
#' Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed. If you're also

#' **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and
#' game server groups.**
#' 
#' Updates information about a registered game server to help GameLift
#' FleetIQ to track game server availability. This operation is called by a
#' game server process that is running on an instance in a game server
#' group.
#' 
#' Use this operation to update the following types of game server
#' information. You can make all three types of updates in the same
#' request:
#' 
#' -   To update the game server's utilization status, identify the game
#'     server and game server group and specify the current utilization
#'     status. Use this status to identify when game servers are currently
#'     hosting games and when they are available to be claimed.
#' 
#' -   To report health status, identify the game server and game server
#'     group and set health check to `HEALTHY`. If a game server does not
#'     report health status for a certain length of time, the game server
#'     is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually
#'     deregistered from the game server group to avoid affecting
#'     utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60
#'     seconds.
#' 
#' -   To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data.
#' 
#' Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and
#' timestamps are updated.

#' ([ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
#' for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto
#' Scaling groups.
#' @param InstanceDefinitions An updated list of EC2 instance types to use in the Auto Scaling group.
#' The instance definitions must specify at least two different instance
#' types that are supported by GameLift FleetIQ. This updated list replaces
#' the entire current list of instance definitions for the game server
#' group. For more information on instance types, see [EC2 Instance
#' Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html)
#' in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*. You can optionally specify capacity

#' Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html)
#' in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
#' @param GameServerProtectionPolicy A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are
#' protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active
#' game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event,
#' causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot
#' be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the
#' event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to
#' this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless
#' of protection status. This property is set to `NO_PROTECTION` by
#' default.
#' @param BalancingStrategy Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and
#' On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the
#' following:
#' 
#' -   `SPOT_ONLY` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group.
#'     If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting,
#'     the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot
#'     Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are
#'     started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
#'     (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
#' 
#' -   `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever
#'     available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
#'     unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting
#'     capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable
#'     Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are
#'     replaced with new On-Demand Instances.
#' 
#' -   `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
#'     server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while
#'     this balancing strategy is in force.

#'
#' Updates the current runtime configuration for the specified fleet, which
#' tells Amazon GameLift how to launch server processes on instances in the
#' fleet. You can update a fleet's runtime configuration at any time after
#' the fleet is created; it does not need to be in an `ACTIVE` status.
#' 
#' To update runtime configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a
#' `RuntimeConfiguration` object with an updated set of server process
#' configurations.
#' 
#' Each instance in a Amazon GameLift fleet checks regularly for an updated
#' runtime configuration and changes how it launches server processes to
#' comply with the latest version. Existing server processes are not
#' affected by the update; runtime configuration changes are applied
#' gradually as existing processes shut down and new processes are launched
#' during Amazon GameLift's normal process recycling activity.

#' Updates Realtime script metadata and content
#'
#' Updates Realtime script metadata and content.
#' 
#' To update script metadata, specify the script ID and provide updated
#' name and/or version values.
#' 
#' To update script content, provide an updated zip file by pointing to
#' either a local file or an Amazon S3 bucket location. You can use either
#' method regardless of how the original script was uploaded. Use the
#' *Version* parameter to track updates to the script.
#' 
#' If the call is successful, the updated metadata is stored in the script
#' record and a revised script is uploaded to the Amazon GameLift service.
#' Once the script is updated and acquired by a fleet instance, the new
#' version is used for all new game sessions.

#' @param Version The version that is associated with a build or script. Version strings
#' do not need to be unique.
#' @param StorageLocation The Amazon S3 location of your Realtime scripts. The storage location
#' must specify the S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and an
#' IAM role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the S3 storage
#' location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region as the script you're

#' zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the
#' `ObjectVersion` parameter to specify an earlier version. To call this
