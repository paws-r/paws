\title{Returns the history of the specified execution as a list of events}
\usage{
sfn_get_execution_history(
  executionArn,
  maxResults = NULL,
  reverseOrder = NULL,
  nextToken = NULL,
  includeExecutionData = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{executionArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of results that are returned per call. You can use
\code{nextToken} to obtain further pages of results. The default is 100 and
the maximum allowed page size is 1000. A value of 0 uses the default.

This is only an upper limit. The actual number of results returned per
call might be fewer than the specified maximum.}

\item{reverseOrder}{Lists events in descending order of their \code{timeStamp}.}

\item{nextToken}{If \code{nextToken} is returned, there are more results available. The value
of \code{nextToken} is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call
again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other
arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using
an expired pagination token will return an \emph{HTTP 400 InvalidToken}
error.}

\item{includeExecutionData}{You can select whether execution data (input or output of a history
event) is returned. The default is \code{true}.}
}
\description{
Returns the history of the specified execution as a list of events. By default, the results are returned in ascending order of the \code{timeStamp} of the events. Use the \code{reverseOrder} parameter to get the latest events first.
