\usage{
eventbridge_remove_targets(Rule, EventBusName, Ids, Force)
}
\arguments{
\item{Rule}{[required] The name of the rule.}

\item{EventBusName}{The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If you omit
this, the default event bus is used.}

\item{Ids}{[required] The IDs of the targets to remove from the rule.}

\item{Force}{If this is a managed rule, created by an AWS service on your behalf, you
must specify \code{Force} as \code{True} to remove targets. This parameter is
ignored for rules that are not managed rules. You can check whether a
rule is a managed rule by using \code{DescribeRule} or \code{ListRules} and
checking the \code{ManagedBy} field of the response.}
}
\description{
Removes the specified targets from the specified rule. When the rule is
triggered, those targets are no longer be invoked.

When you remove a target, when the associated rule triggers, removed
targets might continue to be invoked. Allow a short period of time for
changes to take effect.

This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same
time. If that happens, \code{FailedEntryCount} is non-zero in the response
and each entry in \code{FailedEntries} provides the ID of the failed target
and the error code.
