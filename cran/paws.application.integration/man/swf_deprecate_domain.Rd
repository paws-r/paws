Deprecates the specified domain. After a domain has been deprecated it cannot be used to create new workflow executions or register new types. However, you can still use visibility actions on this domain. Deprecating a domain also deprecates all activity and workflow types registered in the domain. Executions that were started before the domain was deprecated continues to run.
