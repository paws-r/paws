\description{
Lists the platform application objects for the supported push
notification services, such as APNS and FCM. The results for
\code{ListPlatformApplications} are paginated and return a limited list of
applications, up to 100. If additional records are available after the
first page results, then a NextToken string will be returned. To receive
the next page, you call \code{ListPlatformApplications} using the NextToken
string received from the previous call. When there are no more records
to return, NextToken will be null. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html}{Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications}.
