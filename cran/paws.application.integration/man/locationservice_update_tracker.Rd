locationservice_update_tracker(
  Description = NULL,
  PositionFiltering = NULL,

  TrackerName
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Description}{Updates the description for the tracker resource.}

\item{PositionFiltering}{Updates the position filtering for the tracker resource.

Valid values:
\itemize{
\item \code{TimeBased} - Location updates are evaluated against linked geofence
collections, but not every location update is stored. If your update
frequency is more often than 30 seconds, only one update per 30
seconds is stored for each unique device ID.
\item \code{DistanceBased} - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4 ft),
location updates are ignored. Location updates within this distance
are neither evaluated against linked geofence collections, nor
stored. This helps control costs by reducing the number of geofence
evaluations and historical device positions to paginate through.
Distance-based filtering can also reduce the effects of GPS noise
when displaying device trajectories on a map.
\item \code{AccuracyBased} - If the device has moved less than the measured
accuracy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two
consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m
and 10 m, the second update is ignored if the device has moved less
than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated against
linked geofence collections, nor stored. This helps educe the
effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map,
and can help control costs by reducing the number of geofence
evaluations.
