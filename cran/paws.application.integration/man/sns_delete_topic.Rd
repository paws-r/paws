\item{TopicArn}{[required] The ARN of the topic you want to delete.}
}

Deletes a topic and all its subscriptions. Deleting a topic might
prevent some messages previously sent to the topic from being delivered
to subscribers. This action is idempotent, so deleting a topic that does
not exist does not result in an error.
