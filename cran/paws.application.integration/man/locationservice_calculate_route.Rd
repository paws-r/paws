\title{Calculates a route given the following required parameters:
DeparturePosition and DestinationPosition}
\usage{
locationservice_calculate_route(
  CalculatorName,
  DeparturePosition,
  DestinationPosition,
  WaypointPositions = NULL,
  TravelMode = NULL,
  DepartureTime = NULL,
  DepartNow = NULL,
  DistanceUnit = NULL,
  IncludeLegGeometry = NULL,
  CarModeOptions = NULL,
  TruckModeOptions = NULL,
  ArrivalTime = NULL,
  OptimizeFor = NULL,
  Key = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CalculatorName}{[required] The name of the route calculator resource that you want to use to
calculate the route.}

\item{DeparturePosition}{[required] The start position for the route. Defined in \href{https://earth-info.nga.mil/index.php?dir=wgs84&action=wgs84}{World Geodetic System (WGS 84)}
format: \verb{[longitude, latitude]}.
\itemize{
\item For example, \verb{[-123.115, 49.285]}
}

If you specify a departure that's not located on a road, Amazon Location
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/}{moves the position to the nearest road}. If
Esri is the provider for your route calculator, specifying a route that
is longer than 400 km returns a \verb{400 RoutesValidationException} error.

Valid Values: \verb{[-180 to 180,-90 to 90]}}

\item{DestinationPosition}{[required] The finish position for the route. Defined in \href{https://earth-info.nga.mil/index.php?dir=wgs84&action=wgs84}{World Geodetic System (WGS 84)}
format: \verb{[longitude, latitude]}.
\itemize{
\item For example, \verb{[-122.339, 47.615]}
}

If you specify a destination that's not located on a road, Amazon
Location \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/}{moves the position to the nearest road}.

Valid Values: \verb{[-180 to 180,-90 to 90]}}

\item{WaypointPositions}{Specifies an ordered list of up to 23 intermediate positions to include
along a route between the departure position and destination position.
\itemize{
\item For example, from the \code{DeparturePosition} \verb{[-123.115, 49.285]}, the
route follows the order that the waypoint positions are given
\verb{[[-122.757, 49.0021],[-122.349, 47.620]]}
}

If you specify a waypoint position that's not located on a road, Amazon
Location \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/}{moves the position to the nearest road}.

Specifying more than 23 waypoints returns a \verb{400 ValidationException}
error.

If Esri is the provider for your route calculator, specifying a route
that is longer than 400 km returns a \verb{400 RoutesValidationException}
error.

Valid Values: \verb{[-180 to 180,-90 to 90]}}

\item{TravelMode}{Specifies the mode of transport when calculating a route. Used in
estimating the speed of travel and road compatibility. You can choose
\code{Car}, \code{Truck}, \code{Walking}, \code{Bicycle} or \code{Motorcycle} as options for the
\code{TravelMode}.

\code{Bicycle} and \code{Motorcycle} are only valid when using Grab as a data
provider, and only within Southeast Asia.

\code{Truck} is not available for Grab.

For more details on the using Grab for routing, including areas of
coverage, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/}{GrabMaps}
in the \emph{Amazon Location Service Developer Guide}.

The \code{TravelMode} you specify also determines how you specify route
preferences:
\itemize{
\item If traveling by \code{Car} use the \code{CarModeOptions} parameter.
\item If traveling by \code{Truck} use the \code{TruckModeOptions} parameter.
}

Default Value: \code{Car}}

\item{DepartureTime}{Specifies the desired time of departure. Uses the given time to
calculate the route. Otherwise, the best time of day to travel with the
best traffic conditions is used to calculate the route.
\itemize{
\item In \href{https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html}{ISO 8601}
format: \code{YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ}. For example,
\verb{2020â€“07-2T12:15:20.000Z+01:00}
}}

\item{DepartNow}{Sets the time of departure as the current time. Uses the current time to
calculate a route. Otherwise, the best time of day to travel with the
best traffic conditions is used to calculate the route.

Default Value: \code{false}

Valid Values: \code{false} | \code{true}}

\item{DistanceUnit}{Set the unit system to specify the distance.

Default Value: \code{Kilometers}}

\item{IncludeLegGeometry}{Set to include the geometry details in the result for each path between
a pair of positions.

Default Value: \code{false}

Valid Values: \code{false} | \code{true}}

\item{CarModeOptions}{Specifies route preferences when traveling by \code{Car}, such as avoiding
routes that use ferries or tolls.

Requirements: \code{TravelMode} must be specified as \code{Car}.}

\item{TruckModeOptions}{Specifies route preferences when traveling by \code{Truck}, such as avoiding
routes that use ferries or tolls, and truck specifications to consider
when choosing an optimal road.

Requirements: \code{TravelMode} must be specified as \code{Truck}.}

\item{ArrivalTime}{Specifies the desired time of arrival. Uses the given time to calculate
the route. Otherwise, the best time of day to travel with the best
traffic conditions is used to calculate the route.

ArrivalTime is not supported Esri.}

\item{OptimizeFor}{Specifies the distance to optimize for when calculating a route.}

\item{Key}{The optional \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/using-apikeys.html}{API key}
to authorize the request.}
