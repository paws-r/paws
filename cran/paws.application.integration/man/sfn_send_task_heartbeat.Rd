\title{Used by activity workers and task states using the callback pattern to
report to Step Functions that the task represented by the specified
taskToken is still making progress}
\usage{
sfn_send_task_heartbeat(taskToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{taskToken}{[required] The token that represents this task. Task tokens are generated by Step
Functions when tasks are assigned to a worker, or in the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/input-output-contextobject.html}{context object}
when a workflow enters a task state. See
GetActivityTaskOutput\\$taskToken.}
}
\description{
Used by activity workers and task states using the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token}{callback}
pattern to report to Step Functions that the task represented by the
specified \code{taskToken} is still making progress. This action resets the
\code{Heartbeat} clock. The \code{Heartbeat} threshold is specified in the state
machine\'s Amazon States Language definition (\code{HeartbeatSeconds}). This
action does not in itself create an event in the execution history.
However, if the task times out, the execution history contains an
\code{ActivityTimedOut} entry for activities, or a \code{TaskTimedOut} entry for
for tasks using the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-sync}{job run}
or
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token}{callback}
pattern.
}
\details{
The \code{Timeout} of a task, defined in the state machine\'s Amazon States
Language definition, is its maximum allowed duration, regardless of the
number of SendTaskHeartbeat requests received. Use \code{HeartbeatSeconds} to
configure the timeout interval for heartbeats.
