}
\arguments{
\item{BiasPosition}{An optional parameter that indicates a preference for place suggestions
that are closer to a specified position.

If provided, this parameter must contain a pair of numbers. The first
number represents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second number
represents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

For example, \verb{[-123.1174, 49.2847]} represents the position with
longitude \code{-123.1174} and latitude \code{49.2847}.

\code{BiasPosition} and \code{FilterBBox} are mutually exclusive. Specifying both
options results in an error.}

\item{FilterBBox}{An optional parameter that limits the search results by returning only
suggestions within a specified bounding box.

If provided, this parameter must contain a total of four consecutive
numbers in two pairs. The first pair of numbers represents the X and Y
coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the southwest
corner of the bounding box; the second pair of numbers represents the X
and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the
northeast corner of the bounding box.

For example, \verb{[-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542]} represents a
bounding box where the southwest corner has longitude \code{-12.7935} and
latitude \code{-37.4835}, and the northeast corner has longitude \code{-12.0684}
and latitude \code{-36.9542}.

\code{FilterBBox} and \code{BiasPosition} are mutually exclusive. Specifying both
options results in an error.}

\item{FilterCountries}{An optional parameter that limits the search results by returning only
suggestions within the provided list of countries.
\itemize{
\item Use the \href{https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html}{ISO 3166}
3-digit country code. For example, Australia uses three upper-case
characters: \code{AUS}.
}}

\item{IndexName}{[required] The name of the place index resource you want to use for the search.}

\item{Language}{The preferred language used to return results. The value must be a valid
\href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search?rfcs=on&activedrafts=on&name=bcp47}{BCP 47}
language tag, for example, \code{en} for English.

This setting affects the languages used in the results. If no language
is specified, or not supported for a particular result, the partner
automatically chooses a language for the result.

For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for
\verb{Athens, Gr} to get suggestions with the \code{language} parameter set to
\code{en}. The results found will most likely be returned as
\verb{Athens, Greece}.

If you set the \code{language} parameter to \code{el}, for Greek, then the result
found will more likely be returned as \verb{Αθήνα, Ελλάδα}.

If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result will be
in a language that the provider does support.}

\item{MaxResults}{An optional parameter. The maximum number of results returned per
request.

The default: \code{5}}

\item{Text}{[required] The free-form partial text to use to generate place suggestions. For
example, \verb{eiffel tow}.}
