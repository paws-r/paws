\description{
Tests whether the specified event pattern matches the provided event.

Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon
Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event
patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when
creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event
you want to match.
