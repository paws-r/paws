locationservice_search_place_index_for_text(
  IndexName,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{IndexName}{[required] The name of the place index resource you want to use for the search.}

\item{Text}{[required] The address, name, city, or region to be used in the search in free-form
text format. For example, \verb{123 Any Street}.}

\item{BiasPosition}{An optional parameter that indicates a preference for places that are
closer to a specified position.

If provided, this parameter must contain a pair of numbers. The first
number represents the X coordinate, or longitude; the second number
represents the Y coordinate, or latitude.

For example, \verb{[-123.1174, 49.2847]} represents the position with
longitude \code{-123.1174} and latitude \code{49.2847}.

\code{BiasPosition} and \code{FilterBBox} are mutually exclusive. Specifying both
options results in an error.}

\item{FilterBBox}{An optional parameter that limits the search results by returning only
places that are within the provided bounding box.

If provided, this parameter must contain a total of four consecutive
numbers in two pairs. The first pair of numbers represents the X and Y
coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the southwest
corner of the bounding box; the second pair of numbers represents the X
and Y coordinates (longitude and latitude, respectively) of the
northeast corner of the bounding box.

For example, \verb{[-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542]} represents a
bounding box where the southwest corner has longitude \code{-12.7935} and
latitude \code{-37.4835}, and the northeast corner has longitude \code{-12.0684}
and latitude \code{-36.9542}.

\code{FilterBBox} and \code{BiasPosition} are mutually exclusive. Specifying both
options results in an error.}

\item{FilterCountries}{An optional parameter that limits the search results by returning only
places that are in a specified list of countries.
\itemize{
\item Valid values include ISO 3166 3-digit country codes. For example,
Australia uses three upper-case characters: \code{AUS}.
}}

\item{MaxResults}{An optional parameter. The maximum number of results returned per
request.

The default: \code{50}}

\item{Language}{The preferred language used to return results. The value must be a valid
BCP 47 language tag, for example, \code{en} for English.

This setting affects the languages used in the results, but not the
results themselves. If no language is specified, or not supported for a
particular result, the partner automatically chooses a language for the
result.

For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for
\verb{Athens, Greece}, with the \code{language} parameter set to \code{en}. The result
found will most likely be returned as \code{Athens}.

If you set the \code{language} parameter to \code{el}, for Greek, then the result
found will more likely be returned as \eqn{A\Theta\eta\nu\alpha}.

If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result will be
in a language that the provider does support.}

\item{FilterCategories}{A list of one or more Amazon Location categories to filter the returned
places. If you include more than one category, the results will include
results that match \emph{any} of the categories listed.

For more information about using categories, including a list of Amazon
Location categories, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/}{Categories and filtering},
in the \emph{Amazon Location Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{Key}{The optional \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/using-apikeys.html}{API key}
to authorize the request.}
