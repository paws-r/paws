\usage{
eventbridge_update_event_bus(
  Name = NULL,
  KmsKeyIdentifier = NULL,
  Description = NULL,
  DeadLetterConfig = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{The name of the event bus.}

\item{KmsKeyIdentifier}{The identifier of the KMS customer managed key for EventBridge to use,
if you choose to use a customer managed key to encrypt events on this
event bus. The identifier can be the key Amazon Resource Name (ARN),
KeyId, key alias, or key alias ARN.

If you do not specify a customer managed key identifier, EventBridge
uses an Amazon Web Services owned key to encrypt events on the event
bus.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/viewing-keys.html}{Identify and view keys}
in the \emph{Key Management Service Developer Guide}.

Schema discovery is not supported for event buses encrypted using a
customer managed key. EventBridge returns an error if:
\itemize{
\item You call \code{CreateDiscoverer} on an event bus set to use a customer
managed key for encryption.
\item You call \code{UpdatedEventBus} to set a customer managed key on an
event bus with schema discovery enabled.
}

To enable schema discovery on an event bus, choose to use an Amazon Web
Services owned key. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-encryption-event-bus-cmkey.html}{Encrypting events}
in the \emph{Amazon EventBridge User Guide}.

If you have specified that EventBridge use a customer managed key for
encrypting the source event bus, we strongly recommend you also specify
a customer managed key for any archives for the event bus as well.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/encryption-archives.html}{Encrypting archives}
in the \emph{Amazon EventBridge User Guide}.}
