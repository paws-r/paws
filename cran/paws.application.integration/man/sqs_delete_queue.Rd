\title{Deletes the queue specified by the QueueUrl, regardless of the queue's
contents}
\usage{
sqs_delete_queue(QueueUrl)
}
\arguments{
\item{QueueUrl}{[required] The URL of the Amazon SQS queue to delete.

Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.}
}
\description{
Deletes the queue specified by the \code{QueueUrl}, regardless of the
queue\'s contents. If the specified queue doesn\'t exist, Amazon SQS
returns a successful response.
}
\details{
Be careful with the \code{DeleteQueue} action: When you delete a queue, any
messages in the queue are no longer available.

When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds.
Requests you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might
succeed. For example, a \verb{<a>SendMessage</a>} request might succeed,
but after 60 seconds the queue and the message you sent no longer exist.

When you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before
creating a queue with the same name.

Cross-account permissions don\'t apply to this action. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name}{Grant Cross-Account Permissions to a Role and a User Name}
in the \emph{Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide}.
