Lists the endpoints and endpoint attributes for devices in a supported
push notification service, such as FCM and APNS. The results for
\code{ListEndpointsByPlatformApplication} are paginated and return a limited
list of endpoints, up to 100. If additional records are available after
the first page results, then a NextToken string will be returned. To
receive the next page, you call \code{ListEndpointsByPlatformApplication}
again using the NextToken string received from the previous call. When
there are no more records to return, NextToken will be null. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html}{Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications}.
