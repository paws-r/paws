You can use this operation to temporarily stop receiving events from the
specified partner event source. The matching event bus is not deleted.

When you deactivate a partner event source, the source goes into PENDING
state. If it remains in PENDING state for more than two weeks, it is
deleted.

To activate a deactivated partner event source, use
\code{\link[=eventbridge_activate_event_source]{activate_event_source}}.
