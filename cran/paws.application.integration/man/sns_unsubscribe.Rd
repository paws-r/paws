\title{Deletes a subscription}
\usage{
sns_unsubscribe(SubscriptionArn)
}
\arguments{
\item{SubscriptionArn}{[required] The ARN of the subscription to be deleted.}
}
\description{
Deletes a subscription. If the subscription requires authentication for deletion, only the owner of the subscription or the topic's owner can unsubscribe, and an Amazon Web Services signature is required. If the \code{\link[=sns_unsubscribe]{unsubscribe}} call does not require authentication and the requester is not the subscription owner, a final cancellation message is delivered to the endpoint, so that the endpoint owner can easily resubscribe to the topic if the \code{\link[=sns_unsubscribe]{unsubscribe}} request was unintended.

See \url{https://paws-r.github.io/docs/sns/unsubscribe.html} for full documentation.
