\usage{
transfer_update_server(EndpointDetails, EndpointType, HostKey,
  IdentityProviderDetails, LoggingRole, ServerId)
}
\arguments{
\item{EndpointDetails}{The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured
for your SFTP server. With a VPC endpoint, you can restrict access to
your SFTP server to resources only within your VPC. To control incoming
internet traffic, you will need to associate one or more Elastic IP
addresses with your server\'s endpoint.}

\item{EndpointType}{The type of endpoint that you want your SFTP server to connect to. You
can choose to connect to the public internet or a virtual private cloud
(VPC) endpoint. With a VPC endpoint, your SFTP server isn\'t accessible
over the public internet.}

\item{HostKey}{The RSA private key as generated by
\verb{ssh-keygen -N "" -f my-new-server-key}.

If you aren\'t planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP
server to a new AWS SFTP server, don\'t update the host key.
Accidentally changing a server\'s host key can be disruptive.

For more information, see
\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/configuring-servers.html\\#change-host-key\"
in the \emph{AWS SFTP User Guide.}}

\item{IdentityProviderDetails}{This response parameter is an array containing all of the information
required to call a customer\'s authentication API method.}

\item{LoggingRole}{A value that changes the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
that allows Amazon S3 events to be logged in Amazon CloudWatch, turning
logging on or off.}

\item{ServerId}{[required] A system-assigned unique identifier for an SFTP server instance that the
user account is assigned to.}
