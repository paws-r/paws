\usage{
transfer_update_user(HomeDirectory, HomeDirectoryType,
  HomeDirectoryMappings, Policy, Role, ServerId, UserName)
}
\arguments{
\item{HomeDirectory}{A parameter that specifies the landing directory (folder) for a user
when they log in to the server using their client.

An example is \verb{&lt;your-Amazon-S3-bucket-name&gt;/home/username}.}

\item{HomeDirectoryType}{The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users\' home
directory to be when they log into the SFTP serve. If you set it to
\code{PATH}, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket paths as is in
their SFTP clients. If you set it \code{LOGICAL}, you will need to provide
mappings in the \code{HomeDirectoryMappings} for how you want to make S3
paths visible to your user.}

\item{HomeDirectoryMappings}{Logical directory mappings that specify what S3 paths and keys should be
visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You will
need to specify the \"\code{Entry}\" and \"\code{Target}\" pair, where \code{Entry}
shows how the path is made visible and \code{Target} is the actual S3 path.
If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need
to also make sure that your AWS IAM Role provides access to paths in
\code{Target}. The following is an example.

\verb{'\\\[ "/bucket2/documentation", \\\{ "Entry": "your-personal-report.pdf", "Target": "/bucket3/customized-reports/$\\\{transfer:UserName\\\}.pdf" \\\} \\\]'}

In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope down policy
to lock your user down to the designated home directory (\"chroot\"). To
do this, you can set \code{Entry} to \'/\' and set \code{Target} to the
HomeDirectory parameter value.

If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in S3, the
entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use the S3 api to create
0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI,
use the s3api call instead of s3 so you can use the put-object
operation. For example, you use the following:
\verb{aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/}. Make
sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be considered a
folder.}

\item{Policy}{Allows you to supply a scope-down policy for your user so you can use
the same AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple
users. The policy scopes down user access to portions of your Amazon S3
bucket. Variables you can use inside this policy include
\verb{$\\\{Transfer:UserName\\\}}, \verb{$\\\{Transfer:HomeDirectory\\\}}, and
\verb{$\\\{Transfer:HomeBucket\\\}}.

For scope-down policies, AWS Transfer for SFTP stores the policy as a
JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You
save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the \code{Policy} argument.

For an example of a scope-down policy, see
\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/users.html\\#users-policies-scope-down\"\\>Creating
a Scope-Down Policy.

For more information, see
\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API\\_AssumeRole.html\"
in the \emph{AWS Security Token Service API Reference}.}

\item{Role}{The IAM role that controls your user\'s access to your Amazon S3 bucket.
The policies attached to this role will determine the level of access
you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of
your Amazon S3 bucket or buckets. The IAM role should also contain a
trust relationship that allows the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
server to access your resources when servicing your SFTP user\'s
transfer requests.}

\item{ServerId}{[required] A system-assigned unique identifier for an SFTP server instance that the
user account is assigned to.}

\item{UserName}{[required] A unique string that identifies a user and is associated with a server
as specified by the \code{ServerId}. This is the string that will be used by
your user when they log in to your SFTP server. This user name is a
minimum of 3 and a maximum of 32 characters long. The following are
valid characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscore, and hyphen. The user name
can\'t start with a hyphen.}

\description{
Assigns new properties to a user. Parameters you pass modify any or all
of the following: the home directory, role, and policy for the
\code{UserName} and \code{ServerId} you specify.
}
\details{
The response returns the \code{ServerId} and the \code{UserName} for the updated
user.
