\description{
The AWS Migration Hub API methods help to obtain server and application
migration status and integrate your resource-specific migration tool by
providing a programmatic interface to Migration Hub.

Remember that you must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before you
call any of these APIs, or a \code{HomeRegionNotSetException} error will be
returned. Also, you must make the API calls while in your home region.
