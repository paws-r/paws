\usage{
applicationdiscoveryservice_start_import_task(clientRequestToken, name,
  importUrl)
}
\arguments{
\item{clientRequestToken}{Optional. A unique token that you can provide to prevent the same import
request from occurring more than once. If you don\'t provide a token, a
token is automatically generated.

Sending more than one \code{StartImportTask} request with the same client
request token will return information about the original import task
with that client request token.}

\item{name}{[required] A descriptive name for this request. You can use this name to filter
future requests related to this import task, such as identifying
applications and servers that were included in this import task. We
recommend that you use a meaningful name for each import task.}

\item{importUrl}{[required] The URL for your import file that you\'ve uploaded to Amazon S3.

If you\'re using the AWS CLI, this URL is structured as follows:
\verb{s3://BucketName/ImportFileName.CSV}}
}
\description{
Starts an import task, which allows you to import details of your
on-premises environment directly into AWS without having to use the
Application Discovery Service (ADS) tools such as the Discovery
Connector or Discovery Agent. This gives you the option to perform
migration assessment and planning directly from your imported data,
including the ability to group your devices as applications and track
their migration status.
}
\details{

\item Fill out the template with your server and application data.
\item Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make a note of
it\'s Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.
