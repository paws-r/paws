\description{
If the \code{IdentityProviderType} of a file transfer protocol-enabled server
is \code{API_Gateway}, tests whether your API Gateway is set up successfully.
We highly recommend that you call this operation to test your
authentication method as soon as you create your server. By doing so,
you can troubleshoot issues with the API Gateway integration to ensure
that your users can successfully use the service.
