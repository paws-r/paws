\description{
If the \code{IdentityProviderType} of the server is \code{API_Gateway}, tests
whether your API Gateway is set up successfully. We highly recommend

as you create your server. By doing so, you can troubleshoot issues with
the API Gateway integration to ensure that your users can successfully
use the service.
