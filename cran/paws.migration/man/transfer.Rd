\description{
AWS Transfer for SFTP is a fully managed service that enables the
transfer of files directly into and out of Amazon S3 using the Secure
File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)---also known as Secure Shell (SSH) File
Transfer Protocol. AWS helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer
workflows to AWS Transfer for SFTP---by integrating with existing
authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route
53---so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their
applications. With your data in S3, you can use it with AWS services for
processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started
with AWS Transfer for SFTP (AWS SFTP) is easy; there is no
infrastructure to buy and set up.
