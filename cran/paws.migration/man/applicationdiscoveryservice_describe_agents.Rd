\usage{
applicationdiscoveryservice_describe_agents(agentIds, filters,
  maxResults, nextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{agentIds}{The agent or the Connector IDs for which you want information. If you
specify no IDs, the system returns information about all
agents/Connectors associated with your AWS user account.}

\item{filters}{You can filter the request using various logical operators and a
\emph{key}-\emph{value} format. For example:

\verb{\\\{"key": "collectionStatus", "value": "STARTED"\\\}}}

\item{maxResults}{The total number of agents/Connectors to return in a single page of
output. The maximum value is 100.}

\item{nextToken}{Token to retrieve the next set of results. For example, if you
previously specified 100 IDs for \code{DescribeAgentsRequest$agentIds} but
set \code{DescribeAgentsRequest$maxResults} to 10, you received a set of 10
results along with a token. Use that token in this query to get the next
set of 10.}
}
\description{
Lists agents or connectors as specified by ID or other filters. All
agents/connectors associated with your user account can be listed if you
call \code{DescribeAgents} as is without passing any parameters.
