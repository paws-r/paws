\code{OFFLINE} server cannot accept and process file transfer jobs.

not affected by stopping your server. Stopping a server will not reduce
or impact your Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) endpoint billing.
}
\details{
The state of \code{STOPPING} indicates that the server is in an intermediate
state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully offline. The
values of \code{STOP_FAILED} can indicate an error condition.

No response is returned from this call.
