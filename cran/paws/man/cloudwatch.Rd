\description{
Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and
the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to
collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure
for your resources and applications.

CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the
resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For
example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your
Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you
should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can
also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.

In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you
can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain
system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application
performance, and operational health.
