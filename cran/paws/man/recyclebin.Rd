\description{
This is the \emph{Recycle Bin API Reference}. This documentation provides
descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in
Recycle Bin.

Recycle Bin is a resource recovery feature that enables you to restore
accidentally deleted snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs. When using Recycle
Bin, if your resources are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin
for a time period that you specify.

You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its
retention period expires. After you restore a resource from the Recycle
Bin, the resource is removed from the Recycle Bin, and you can then use
it in the same way you use any other resource of that type in your
account. If the retention period expires and the resource is not
restored, the resource is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and
is no longer available for recovery. For more information about Recycle
Bin, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/}{Recycle Bin} in the
\emph{Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide}.
