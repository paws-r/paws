\value{
A client for the service. You can call the service's operations using
syntax like \code{svc$operation(...)}, where \code{svc} is the name you've assigned
to the client. The available operations are listed in the
Operations section.

\description{
IAM Identity Center OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables
a client (such as CLI or a native application) to register with IAM
Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s
access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM
Identity Center.

IAM Identity Center uses the \code{sso} and \code{identitystore} API namespaces.

\strong{Considerations for Using This Guide}

Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review
the following important information about how the IAM Identity Center
OIDC service works.
\itemize{
\item The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the
portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant standard
(\href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628}{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628})
that are necessary to enable single sign-on authentication with the
CLI.
\item With older versions of the CLI, the service only emits OIDC access
tokens, so to obtain a new token, users must explicitly
re-authenticate. To access the OIDC flow that supports token refresh
and doesn’t require re-authentication, update to the latest CLI
version (1.27.10 for CLI V1 and 2.9.0 for CLI V2) with support for
OIDC token refresh and configurable IAM Identity Center session
durations. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html}{Configure Amazon Web Services access portal session duration}
.
\item The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all
Amazon Web Services account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity
Center user, not just a particular application.
\item The documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to
convert the access token into Amazon Web Services Auth (“sigv4”)
credentials for use with IAM-protected Amazon Web Services service
endpoints. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html}{GetRoleCredentials}
in the \emph{IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide}.
}

For general information about IAM Identity Center, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html}{What is IAM Identity Center?}
in the \emph{IAM Identity Center User Guide}.
