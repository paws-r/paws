\value{
A client for the service. You can call the service's operations using
syntax like \code{svc$operation(...)}, where \code{svc} is the name you've assigned
to the client. The available operations are listed in the

\description{
Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage
links between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using
\emph{CloudWatch cross-account observability}. With CloudWatch cross-account
observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span
multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and
analyze your metrics, logs, traces, Application Signals services,
service level objectives (SLOs), Application Insights applications, and
internet monitors in any of the linked accounts without account
boundaries.

Set up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as \emph{monitoring accounts}
and link them with multiple \emph{source accounts}. A monitoring account is a
central Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with
observability data generated from source accounts. A source account is
an individual Amazon Web Services account that generates observability
data for the resources that reside in it. Source accounts share their
observability data with the monitoring account. The shared observability
data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon CloudWatch
Logs, traces in X-Ray, Application Signals services, service level
objectives (SLOs), applications in Amazon CloudWatch Application
Insights, and internet monitors in CloudWatch Internet Monitor.

When you set up a link, you can choose to share the metrics from all
namespaces with the monitoring account, or filter to a subset of
namespaces. And for CloudWatch Logs, you can choose to share all log
groups with the monitoring account, or filter to a subset of log groups.
