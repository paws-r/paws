Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack

You can use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage
your support cases in Slack for your Amazon Web Services account. After
you configure your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web
Services Support App, you can perform the following tasks directly in
your Slack channel:
\itemize{
\item Create, search, update, and resolve your support cases
\item Request service quota increases for your account
\item Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to your channel so that
you can chat directly about your support cases
}

For more information about how to perform these actions in Slack, see
the following documentation in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Support User
Guide}:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/aws-support-app-for-slack.html}{Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack}
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/joining-a-live-chat-session.html}{Joining a live chat session with Amazon Web Services Support}
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/}{Requesting service quota increases}
\item \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/support-app-commands.html}{Amazon Web Services Support App commands in Slack}
}

You can also use the Amazon Web Services Management Console instead of
the Amazon Web Services Support App API to manage your Slack
configurations. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/authorize-slack-workspace.html}{Authorize a Slack workspace to enable the Amazon Web Services Support App}.
\itemize{
\item You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the
Amazon Web Services Support App API.
\item For more information about the Amazon Web Services Support App
endpoints, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/awssupport.html#awssupport_app_region}{Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack endpoints}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference}.
