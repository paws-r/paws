\description{
Use the Amazon Web Services Budgets API to plan your service usage,
service costs, and instance reservations. This API reference provides
descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and
data types for the Amazon Web Services Budgets feature.

Budgets provide you with a way to see the following information:
\itemize{
\item How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier
limits
\item Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your Reserved
Instances (RIs)
\item Your current estimated charges from Amazon Web Services, and how
much your predicted usage will accrue in charges by the end of the
month
\item How much of your budget has been used
}

Amazon Web Services updates your budget status several times a day.
Budgets track your unblended costs, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You
can create the following types of budgets:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cost budgets} - Plan how much you want to spend on a service.
\item \strong{Usage budgets} - Plan how much you want to use one or more
services.
\item \strong{RI utilization budgets} - Define a utilization threshold, and
receive alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This
lets you see if your RIs are unused or under-utilized.
\item \strong{RI coverage budgets} - Define a coverage threshold, and receive
alerts when the number of your instance hours that are covered by
RIs fall below that threshold. This lets you see how much of your
instance usage is covered by a reservation.
}

Service Endpoint

The Amazon Web Services Budgets API provides the following endpoint:
\itemize{
\item https://budgets.amazonaws.com
}
