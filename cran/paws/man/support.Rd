\description{
Amazon Web Services Support

The \emph{Amazon Web Services Support API Reference} is intended for
programmers who need detailed information about the Amazon Web Services
Support operations and data types. You can use the API to manage your
support cases programmatically. The Amazon Web Services Support API uses
HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.
\itemize{
\item You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
\item If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that
doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
plan, the \code{SubscriptionRequiredException} error message appears. For
information about changing your support plan, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/}{Amazon Web Services Support}.
}

You can also use the Amazon Web Services Support API to access features
for \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/}{Trusted Advisor}.
You can return a list of checks and their descriptions, get check
results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of
checks.

You can manage your support cases with the following Amazon Web Services
Support API operations:
\itemize{
\item The \code{create_case},
\code{describe_cases},
\code{describe_attachment}, and
\code{resolve_case} operations create Amazon Web
Services Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and
resolve cases.
\item The \code{describe_communications},
\code{add_communication_to_case},
and \code{add_attachments_to_set}
operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to Amazon
Web Services Support cases.
\item The \code{describe_services} and
\code{describe_severity_levels}
operations return Amazon Web Service names, service codes, service
categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when
you call the \code{create_case} operation.
}

You can also use the Amazon Web Services Support API to call the Trusted
Advisor operations. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/trusted-advisor.html}{Trusted Advisor}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Support User Guide}.

For authentication of requests, Amazon Web Services Support uses
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html}{Signature Version 4 Signing Process}.

For more information about this service and the endpoints to use, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/about-support-api.html}{About the Amazon Web Services Support API}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Support User Guide}.
