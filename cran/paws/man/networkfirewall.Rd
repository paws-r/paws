\description{
This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for
developers who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API
actions, data types, and errors.
\itemize{
\item The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as
calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error
handling. For general information about using the Amazon Web
Services REST APIs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html}{Amazon Web Services APIs}.

To access Network Firewall using the REST API endpoint:
\verb{https://network-firewall.<region>.amazonaws.com }
\item Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to
access an API that's tailored to the programming language or
platform that you're using. For more information, see \href{https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/#SDKs}{Amazon Web Services SDKs}.
\item For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and
step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network
Firewall console, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/}{Network Firewall Developer Guide}.

Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion
detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
(Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the
perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and
coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct
Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible with Suricata,
a free, open source intrusion detection system (IDS) engine. Network
Firewall supports Suricata version 5.0.2. For information about
Suricata, see the Suricata website.

You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in
a number of ways. The following are just a few examples:
\itemize{
\item Allow domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service
endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.
\item Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain
names that your applications can access.
\item Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your
VPC.
\item Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS,
regardless of the port used.
}

To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both
Amazon VPC and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon
VPC, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/}{Amazon VPC User Guide}.

To start using Network Firewall, do the following:
\enumerate{
\item (Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect,
create it in Amazon VPC.
\item In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a
firewall endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network
Firewall.
\item In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to
define the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that
you want your firewall to have.
\item In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule
groups and specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior.
\item In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall
policy and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint
in each subnet that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in
the firewall policy.
\item In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic
through the new firewall endpoints.
