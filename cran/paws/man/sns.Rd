\description{
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that
enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications
can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to
interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more
information about this product see
\href{http://aws.amazon.com/sns/}{https://aws.amazon.com/sns}. For detailed
information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls,
see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/}{Amazon SNS Developer Guide}.

We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your
preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that
automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing
your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses.
For a list of available SDKs, go to \href{http://aws.amazon.com/tools/}{Tools for Amazon Web Services}.
