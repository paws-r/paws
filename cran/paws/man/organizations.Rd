\description{
Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your
multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an \emph{organization} and
centrally manage your accounts and their resources.

This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For
more information about using this service, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html}{Organizations User Guide}.

\strong{Support and feedback for Organizations}

We welcome your feedback. You can post your feedback and questions in
the Organizations support forum. For more information about the Amazon
Web Services Support forums, see Forums Help.

\strong{Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK}

For the current release of Organizations, specify the \code{us-east-1} region
for all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial
Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the
Amazon Web Services Regions in China, then specify \code{cn-northwest-1}. You
can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:
\itemize{
\item Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the
endpoint and its region:

\verb{--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com}
\emph{(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)}

or

\verb{--endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn}
\emph{(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)}
\item Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with
this command:

\verb{aws configure set default.region us-east-1} \emph{(from commercial
Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)}

or

\verb{aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1} \emph{(from Amazon Web
Services Regions in China)}
\item Use the following parameter with each command to specify the
endpoint:

\verb{--region us-east-1} \emph{(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions
outside of China)}

or

\verb{--region cn-northwest-1} \emph{(from Amazon Web Services Regions in
China)}
}

\strong{Recording API Requests}

Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web
Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log
files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by
CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Organizations service
received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about
Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/#orgs_cloudtrail-integration}{Logging Organizations API calls with CloudTrail}
in the \emph{Organizations User Guide}. To learn more about CloudTrail,
including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html}{CloudTrail User Guide}.
