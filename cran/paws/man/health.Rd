syntax like \code{svc$operation(...)}, where \code{svc} is the name you've assigned
to the client. The available operations are listed in the

\description{
Health

The Health API provides access to the Health information that appears in
the Health Dashboard. You can use the API operations to get information
about events that might affect your Amazon Web Services services and
resources.

You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan
from \href{https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/}{Amazon Web Services Support} to use the Health API.
If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services account that
doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan,
you receive a \code{SubscriptionRequiredException} error.

For API access, you need an access key ID and a secret access key. Use
temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys when possible.
Temporary credentials include an access key ID, a secret access key, and
a security token that indicates when the credentials expire. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#securing_access-keys}{Best practices for managing Amazon Web Services access keys}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference}.

You can use the Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS)
to call the Health API operations. Health supports a multi-Region
application architecture and has two regional endpoints in an
active-passive configuration. You can use the high availability endpoint
example to determine which Amazon Web Services Region is active, so that
you can get the latest information from the API. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html}{Accessing the Health API} in
the \emph{Health User Guide}.

For authentication of requests, Health uses the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html}{Signature Version 4 Signing Process}.

If your Amazon Web Services account is part of Organizations, you can
use the Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a
centralized view of Health events across all accounts in your
organization. You can aggregate Health events in real time to identify
accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event
or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view
API operations to enable this feature and return event information. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html}{Aggregating Health events}
in the \emph{Health User Guide}.

When you use the Health API operations to return Health events, see the
following recommendations:
\itemize{
\item Use the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode}{eventScopeCode}
parameter to specify whether to return Health events that are public
or account-specific.
\item Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if
you call the
\code{describe_events_for_organization}
operation to get all events in your organization, you might receive
several page results. Specify the \code{nextToken} in the next request to
return more results.
