\value{
A client for the service. You can call the service's operations using
syntax like \code{svc$operation(...)}, where \code{svc} is the name you've assigned
to the client. The available operations are listed in the
Operations section.

\description{
App Runner

App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and
cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or
source code to a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in
seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute
service to use, or understand how to provision and configure Amazon Web
Services resources.

App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code
repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully
managed operations, high performance, scalability, and security.

For more information about App Runner, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/}{App Runner Developer Guide}. For release
information, see the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/}{App Runner Release Notes}.

To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to
access the API, see \href{https://builder.aws.com/build/tools}{Tools for Amazon Web Services}.

\strong{Endpoints}

For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html}{App Runner endpoints and quotas} in
the \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference}.
