\arguments{
\item{Name}{The name of a voice contact that is shown to an agent in the Contact
Control Panel (CCP).}

\item{Description}{A description of the voice contact that appears in the agent's snapshot
in the CCP logs. For more information about CCP logs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/download-ccp-logs.html}{Download and review CCP logs}
in the \emph{Amazon Connect Administrator Guide}.}

\item{References}{A formatted URL that is shown to an agent in the Contact Control Panel
(CCP). Contacts can have the following reference types at the time of
creation: \code{URL} | \code{NUMBER} | \code{STRING} | \code{DATE} | \code{EMAIL}. \code{ATTACHMENT}
is not a supported reference type during voice contact creation.}

\item{RelatedContactId}{The \code{contactId} that is related to this contact. Linking voice, task, or
chat by using \code{RelatedContactID} copies over contact attributes from the
related contact to the new contact. All updates to user-defined
attributes in the new contact are limited to the individual contact ID.
There are no limits to the number of contacts that can be linked by
using \code{RelatedContactId}.}

\item{DestinationPhoneNumber}{[required] The phone number of the customer, in E.164 format.}

\item{ContactFlowId}{[required] The identifier of the flow for the outbound call. To see the
ContactFlowId in the Amazon Connect admin website, on the navigation
menu go to \strong{Routing}, \strong{Contact Flows}. Choose the flow. On the flow
page, under the name of the flow, choose \strong{Show additional flow
information}. The ContactFlowId is the last part of the ARN, shown here
in bold:

arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:instance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/contact-flow/\strong{846ec553-a005-41c0-8341-xxxxxxxxxxxx}}

\item{InstanceId}{[required] The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html}{find the instance ID}
in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.}

\item{ClientToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services SDK
populates this field. For more information about idempotency, see
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/}{Making retries safe with idempotent APIs}.
The token is valid for 7 days after creation. If a contact is already
started, the contact ID is returned.}

\item{SourcePhoneNumber}{The phone number associated with the Amazon Connect instance, in E.164
format. If you do not specify a source phone number, you must specify a
queue.}

\item{QueueId}{The queue for the call. If you specify a queue, the phone displayed for
caller ID is the phone number specified in the queue. If you do not
specify a queue, the queue defined in the flow is used. If you do not
specify a queue, you must specify a source phone number.}

\item{Attributes}{A custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The attributes are
standard Amazon Connect attributes, and can be accessed in flows just
like any other contact attributes.

There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
contact. Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and
underscore characters.}

\item{AnswerMachineDetectionConfig}{Configuration of the answering machine detection for this outbound call.}

\item{CampaignId}{The campaign identifier of the outbound communication.}

\item{TrafficType}{Denotes the class of traffic. Calls with different traffic types are
handled differently by Amazon Connect. The default value is \code{GENERAL}.
Use \code{CAMPAIGN} if \code{EnableAnswerMachineDetection} is set to \code{true}. For
all other cases, use \code{GENERAL}.}
