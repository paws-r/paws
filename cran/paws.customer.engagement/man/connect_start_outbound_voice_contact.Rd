flow}
\usage{
connect_start_outbound_voice_contact(
  DestinationPhoneNumber,
  ContactFlowId,
  InstanceId,
  ClientToken = NULL,
  SourcePhoneNumber = NULL,
  QueueId = NULL,
  Attributes = NULL,
  AnswerMachineDetectionConfig = NULL,
  CampaignId = NULL,
  TrafficType = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DestinationPhoneNumber}{[required] The phone number of the customer, in E.164 format.}

\item{ContactFlowId}{[required] The identifier of the contact flow for the outbound call. To see the
ContactFlowId in the Amazon Connect console user interface, on the
navigation menu go to \strong{Routing}, \strong{Contact Flows}. Choose the contact
flow. On the contact flow page, under the name of the contact flow,
choose \strong{Show additional flow information}. The ContactFlowId is the
last part of the ARN, shown here in bold:

arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:instance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/contact-flow/\strong{846ec553-a005-41c0-8341-xxxxxxxxxxxx}}

\item{InstanceId}{[required] The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the
instanceId in the ARN of the instance.}

\item{ClientToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. The token is valid for 7 days after
creation. If a contact is already started, the contact ID is returned.}

\item{SourcePhoneNumber}{The phone number associated with the Amazon Connect instance, in E.164
format. If you do not specify a source phone number, you must specify a
queue.}

\item{QueueId}{The queue for the call. If you specify a queue, the phone displayed for
caller ID is the phone number specified in the queue. If you do not
specify a queue, the queue defined in the contact flow is used. If you
do not specify a queue, you must specify a source phone number.}

\item{Attributes}{A custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The attributes are
standard Amazon Connect attributes, and can be accessed in contact flows
just like any other contact attributes.

There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
contact. Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and
underscore characters.}

\item{AnswerMachineDetectionConfig}{Configuration of the answering machine detection for this outbound call.}

\item{CampaignId}{The campaign identifier of the outbound communication.}

\item{TrafficType}{Denotes the class of traffic. Calls with different traffic types are
handled differently by Amazon Connect. The default value is \code{GENERAL}.
Use \code{CAMPAIGN} if \code{EnableAnswerMachineDetection} is set to \code{true}. For
all other cases, use \code{GENERAL}.}
