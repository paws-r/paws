\title{Gets the real-time metric data from the specified Amazon Connect
instance}
\usage{
connect_get_current_metric_data(
  InstanceId,
  Filters,
  Groupings = NULL,
  CurrentMetrics,
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  SortCriteria = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{InstanceId}{[required] The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html}{find the instance ID}
in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.}

\item{Filters}{[required] The filters to apply to returned metrics. You can filter up to the
following limits:
\itemize{
\item Queues: 100
\item Routing profiles: 100
\item Channels: 3 (VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels are supported.)
\item RoutingStepExpressions: 50
}

Metric data is retrieved only for the resources associated with the
queues or routing profiles, and by any channels included in the filter.
(You cannot filter by both queue AND routing profile.) You can include
both resource IDs and resource ARNs in the same request.

When using the \code{RoutingStepExpression} filter, you need to pass exactly
one \code{QueueId}. The filter is also case sensitive so when using the
\code{RoutingStepExpression} filter, grouping by \code{ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION} is
required.

Currently tagging is only supported on the resources that are passed in
the filter.}

\item{Groupings}{The grouping applied to the metrics returned. For example, when grouped
by \code{QUEUE}, the metrics returned apply to each queue rather than
aggregated for all queues.
\itemize{
\item If you group by \code{CHANNEL}, you should include a Channels filter.
VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels are supported.
\item If you group by \code{ROUTING_PROFILE}, you must include either a queue
or routing profile filter. In addition, a routing profile filter is
required for metrics \code{CONTACTS_SCHEDULED}, \code{CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE}, and
\code{ OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE}.
\item If no \code{Grouping} is included in the request, a summary of metrics is
returned.
\item When using the \code{RoutingStepExpression} filter, group by
\code{ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION} is required.
}}

\item{CurrentMetrics}{[required] The metrics to retrieve. Specify the name and unit for each metric. The
following metrics are available. For a description of all the metrics,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html}{Real-time Metrics Definitions}
in the \emph{Amazon Connect Administrator Guide}.

\strong{AGENTS_AFTER_CONTACT_WORK}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report:
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#aftercallwork-real-time}{ACW}

\strong{AGENTS_AVAILABLE}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report:
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#available-real-time}{Available}

\strong{AGENTS_ERROR}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report:
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#error-real-time}{Error}

\strong{AGENTS_NON_PRODUCTIVE}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report: \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#non-productive-time-real-time}{NPT (Non-Productive Time)}

\strong{AGENTS_ON_CALL}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report: \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#on-call-real-time}{On contact}

\strong{AGENTS_ON_CONTACT}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report: \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#on-call-real-time}{On contact}

\strong{AGENTS_ONLINE}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report:
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#online-real-time}{Online}

\strong{AGENTS_STAFFED}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report:
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#staffed-real-time}{Staffed}

\strong{CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report: \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#in-queue-real-time}{In queue}

\strong{CONTACTS_SCHEDULED}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report:
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#scheduled-real-time}{Scheduled}

\strong{OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE}

Unit: SECONDS

When you use groupings, Unit says SECONDS and the Value is returned in
SECONDS.

When you do not use groupings, Unit says SECONDS but the Value is
returned in MILLISECONDS. For example, if you get a response like this:

\verb{\\\{ "Metric": \\\{ "Name": "OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE", "Unit": "SECONDS" \\\}, "Value": 24113.0 }\}

The actual OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE is 24 seconds.

When the filter \code{RoutingStepExpression} is used, this metric is still
calculated from enqueue time. For example, if a contact that has been
queued under \verb{<Expression 1>} for 10 seconds has expired and
\verb{<Expression 2>} becomes active, then \code{OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE} for this
queue will be counted starting from 10, not 0.

Name in real-time metrics report:
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#oldest-real-time}{Oldest}

\strong{SLOTS_ACTIVE}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report:
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#active-real-time}{Active}

\strong{SLOTS_AVAILABLE}

Unit: COUNT

Name in real-time metrics report:
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#availability-real-time}{Availability}}

\item{NextToken}{The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
previous response in the next request to retrieve the next set of
results.

The token expires after 5 minutes from the time it is created.
Subsequent requests that use the token must use the same request
parameters as the request that generated the token.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return per page.}

\item{SortCriteria}{The way to sort the resulting response based on metrics. You can enter
one sort criteria. By default resources are sorted based on
\code{AGENTS_ONLINE}, \code{DESCENDING}. The metric collection is sorted based on
the input metrics.

Note the following:
\itemize{
\item Sorting on \code{SLOTS_ACTIVE} and \code{SLOTS_AVAILABLE} is not supported.
