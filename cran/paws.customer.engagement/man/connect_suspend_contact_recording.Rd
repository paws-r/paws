\description{
When a contact is being recorded, this API suspends recording whatever is selected in the flow configuration: call, screen, or both. If only call recording or only screen recording is enabled, then it would be suspended. For example, you might suspend the screen recording while collecting sensitive information, such as a credit card number. Then use ResumeContactRecording to restart recording the screen.
