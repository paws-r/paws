\description{
Initiates a contact flow to start a new chat for the customer. Response
of this API provides a token required to obtain credentials from the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect-participant/latest/APIReference/API_CreateParticipantConnection.html}{CreateParticipantConnection}
API in the Amazon Connect Participant Service.

When a new chat contact is successfully created, clients need to
subscribe to the participantâ€™s connection for the created chat within 5
minutes. This is achieved by invoking
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect-participant/latest/APIReference/API_CreateParticipantConnection.html}{CreateParticipantConnection}
with WEBSOCKET and CONNECTION_CREDENTIALS.

A 429 error occurs in two situations:
\itemize{
\item API rate limit is exceeded. API TPS throttling returns a
\code{TooManyRequests} exception from the API Gateway.
\item The \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html}{quota for concurrent active chats}
is exceeded. Active chat throttling returns a
\code{LimitExceededException}.
}

For more information about how chat works, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/chat.html}{Chat}
in the \emph{Amazon Connect Administrator Guide}.
