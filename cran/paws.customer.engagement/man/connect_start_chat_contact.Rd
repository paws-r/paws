\arguments{
\item{InstanceId}{[required] The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html}{find the instance ID}
in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.}

\item{ContactFlowId}{[required] The identifier of the flow for initiating the chat. To see the
ContactFlowId in the Amazon Connect admin website, on the navigation
menu go to \strong{Routing}, \strong{Flows}. Choose the flow. On the flow page,
under the name of the flow, choose \strong{Show additional flow information}.
The ContactFlowId is the last part of the ARN, shown here in bold:

arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:instance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/contact-flow/\strong{846ec553-a005-41c0-8341-xxxxxxxxxxxx}}

\item{Attributes}{A custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The attributes are
standard Amazon Connect attributes. They can be accessed in flows just
like any other contact attributes.

There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
contact. Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and
underscore characters.}

\item{ParticipantDetails}{[required] Information identifying the participant.}

\item{InitialMessage}{The initial message to be sent to the newly created chat. If you have a
Lex bot in your flow, the initial message is not delivered to the Lex
bot.}

\item{ClientToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services SDK
populates this field. For more information about idempotency, see
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/}{Making retries safe with idempotent APIs}.}

\item{ChatDurationInMinutes}{The total duration of the newly started chat session. If not specified,
the chat session duration defaults to 25 hour. The minimum configurable
time is 60 minutes. The maximum configurable time is 10,080 minutes (7
days).}

\item{SupportedMessagingContentTypes}{The supported chat message content types. Supported types are
\code{text/plain}, \code{text/markdown}, \code{application/json},
\code{application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.message.interactive}, and
\code{application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.message.interactive.response}.

Content types must always contain \code{text/plain}. You can then put any
other supported type in the list. For example, all the following lists
are valid because they contain \code{text/plain}:
\verb{[text/plain, text/markdown, application/json]},
\verb{[text/markdown, text/plain]},
\verb{[text/plain, application/json, application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.message.interactive.response]}.

The type \code{application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.message.interactive} is
required to use the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/show-view-block.html}{Show view}
flow block.}

\item{PersistentChat}{Enable persistent chats. For more information about enabling persistent
chat, and for example use cases and how to configure for them, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/chat-persistence.html}{Enable persistent chat}.}

\item{RelatedContactId}{The unique identifier for an Amazon Connect contact. This identifier is
related to the chat starting.

You cannot provide data for both RelatedContactId and PersistentChat.}

\item{SegmentAttributes}{A set of system defined key-value pairs stored on individual contact
segments using an attribute map. The attributes are standard Amazon
Connect attributes. They can be accessed in flows.

Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, -, and _.

This field can be used to show channel subtype, such as \code{connect:Guide}.

The types \code{application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.message.interactive} and
\code{application/vnd.amazonaws.connect.message.interactive.response} must be
present in the SupportedMessagingContentTypes field of this API in order
to set \code{SegmentAttributes} as
\{\verb{ "connect:Subtype": \\\{"valueString" : "connect:Guide" \\\}\\\}}.}

\item{CustomerId}{The customer's identification number. For example, the \code{CustomerId} may
be a customer number from your CRM.}
