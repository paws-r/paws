\usage{
connectcases_search_all_related_items(
  domainId,
  maxResults = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{domainId}{[required] The unique identifier of the Cases domain.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of results to return per page.}

\item{nextToken}{The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
previous response in the next request to retrieve the next set of
results.}

\item{filters}{The list of types of related items and their parameters to use for
filtering. The filters work as an OR condition: caller gets back related
items that match any of the specified filter types.}

items should be returned. Supports sorting by association time or case
ID. The sorts work in the order specified: first sort term takes

\description{
Searches for related items across all cases within a domain. This is a global search operation that returns related items from multiple cases, unlike the case-specific \code{\link[=connectcases_search_related_items]{search_related_items}} API.
