}
\arguments{
\item{OriginalMessageId}{[required] The message ID of the message to be bounced.}

\item{BounceSender}{[required] The address to use in the \"From\" header of the bounce message. This
must be an identity that you have verified with Amazon SES.}

\item{Explanation}{Human-readable text for the bounce message to explain the failure. If
not specified, the text will be auto-generated based on the bounced
recipient information.}

the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy
that permits you to use the address in the \"From\" header of the
bounce. For more information about sending authorization, see the
