## Resubmission.

This is a resubmission. In this submission, I have changed:

* An invalid link was removed.

## Test environments
* local Windows install, R 3.5.1
* R-hub (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no NOTEs, ERRORs, or WARNINGs.

## Downstream dependencies

All downstream dependencies ('paws') pass R CMD check.
