\title{Creates a job that uses workers to label the data objects in your input
dataset}
\usage{
sagemaker_create_labeling_job(
  LabelingJobName,
  LabelAttributeName,
  InputConfig,
  OutputConfig,
  RoleArn,
  LabelCategoryConfigS3Uri = NULL,
  StoppingConditions = NULL,
  LabelingJobAlgorithmsConfig = NULL,
  HumanTaskConfig,
  Tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{LabelingJobName}{[required] The name of the labeling job. This name is used to identify the job in a
list of labeling jobs. Labeling job names must be unique within an
Amazon Web Services account and region. \code{LabelingJobName} is not case
sensitive. For example, Example-job and example-job are considered the
same labeling job name by Ground Truth.}

\item{LabelAttributeName}{[required] The attribute name to use for the label in the output manifest file.
This is the key for the key/value pair formed with the label that a
worker assigns to the object. The \code{LabelAttributeName} must meet the
following requirements.
\itemize{
\item The name can't end with "-metadata".
\item If you are using one of the following \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-task-types.html}{built-in task types},
the attribute name \emph{must} end with "-ref". If the task type you are
using is not listed below, the attribute name \emph{must not} end with
"-ref".
\itemize{
\item Image semantic segmentation (\verb{SemanticSegmentation)}, and
adjustment (\code{AdjustmentSemanticSegmentation}) and verification
(\code{VerificationSemanticSegmentation}) labeling jobs for this task
type.
\item Video frame object detection (\code{VideoObjectDetection}), and
adjustment and verification (\code{AdjustmentVideoObjectDetection})
labeling jobs for this task type.
\item Video frame object tracking (\code{VideoObjectTracking}), and
adjustment and verification (\code{AdjustmentVideoObjectTracking})
labeling jobs for this task type.
\item 3D point cloud semantic segmentation
(\verb{3DPointCloudSemanticSegmentation}), and adjustment and
verification (\code{Adjustment3DPointCloudSemanticSegmentation})
labeling jobs for this task type.
\item 3D point cloud object tracking (\verb{3DPointCloudObjectTracking}),
and adjustment and verification
(\code{Adjustment3DPointCloudObjectTracking}) labeling jobs for this
task type.
}
}

If you are creating an adjustment or verification labeling job, you must
use a \emph{different} \code{LabelAttributeName} than the one used in the original
labeling job. The original labeling job is the Ground Truth labeling job
that produced the labels that you want verified or adjusted. To learn
more about adjustment and verification labeling jobs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-verification-data.html}{Verify and Adjust Labels}.}

\item{InputConfig}{[required] Input data for the labeling job, such as the Amazon S3 location of the
data objects and the location of the manifest file that describes the
data objects.

You must specify at least one of the following: \code{S3DataSource} or
\code{SnsDataSource}.
\itemize{
\item Use \code{SnsDataSource} to specify an SNS input topic for a streaming
labeling job. If you do not specify and SNS input topic ARN, Ground
Truth will create a one-time labeling job that stops after all data
objects in the input manifest file have been labeled.
\item Use \code{S3DataSource} to specify an input manifest file for both
streaming and one-time labeling jobs. Adding an \code{S3DataSource} is
optional if you use \code{SnsDataSource} to create a streaming labeling
job.
}

If you use the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce, your input data should
not include confidential information, personal information or protected
health information. Use \code{ContentClassifiers} to specify that your data
is free of personally identifiable information and adult content.}

\item{OutputConfig}{[required] The location of the output data and the Amazon Web Services Key
Management Service key ID for the key used to encrypt the output data,
if any.}

\item{RoleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) that Amazon SageMaker assumes to
perform tasks on your behalf during data labeling. You must grant this
role the necessary permissions so that Amazon SageMaker can successfully
complete data labeling.}

\item{LabelCategoryConfigS3Uri}{The S3 URI of the file, referred to as a \emph{label category configuration
file}, that defines the categories used to label the data objects.

For 3D point cloud and video frame task types, you can add label
category attributes and frame attributes to your label category
configuration file. To learn how, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-label-cat-config-attributes.html}{Create a Labeling Category Configuration File for 3D Point Cloud Labeling Jobs}.

For named entity recognition jobs, in addition to \code{"labels"}, you must
provide worker instructions in the label category configuration file
using the \code{"instructions"} parameter:
\verb{"instructions": \{"shortInstruction":"<h1>Add header</h1><p>Add Instructions</p>", "fullInstruction":"<p>Add additional instructions.</p>"\}}.
For details and an example, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-named-entity-recg.html#sms-creating-ner-api}{Create a Named Entity Recognition Labeling Job (API)}
.

For all other \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-task-types.html}{built-in task types}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-custom-templates.html}{custom tasks},
your label category configuration file must be a JSON file in the
following format. Identify the labels you want to use by replacing
\code{label_1}, \code{label_2},\code{...},\code{label_n} with your label categories.

\verb{\\\{ }

\verb{"document-version": "2018-11-28",}

\verb{"labels": [\{"label": "label_1"\},\{"label": "label_2"\},...\{"label": "label_n"\}]}

\verb{\\\}}

Note the following about the label category configuration file:
\itemize{
\item For image classification and text classification (single and
multi-label) you must specify at least two label categories. For all
other task types, the minimum number of label categories required is
one.
\item Each label category must be unique, you cannot specify duplicate
label categories.
\item If you create a 3D point cloud or video frame adjustment or
verification labeling job, you must include
\code{auditLabelAttributeName} in the label category configuration. Use
this parameter to enter the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLabelingJob.html#sagemaker-CreateLabelingJob-request-LabelAttributeName}{\code{LabelAttributeName}}
of the labeling job you want to adjust or verify annotations of.
}}

\item{StoppingConditions}{A set of conditions for stopping the labeling job. If any of the
conditions are met, the job is automatically stopped. You can use these
conditions to control the cost of data labeling.}

\item{LabelingJobAlgorithmsConfig}{Configures the information required to perform automated data labeling.}

\item{HumanTaskConfig}{[required] Configures the labeling task and how it is presented to workers;
including, but not limited to price, keywords, and batch size (task
count).}

\item{Tags}{An array of key/value pairs. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html#allocation-what}{Using Cost Allocation Tags}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide}.}
