\usage{
rekognition_get_celebrity_recognition(JobId, MaxResults, NextToken,
  SortBy)
}
\arguments{
\item{JobId}{[required] Job identifier for the required celebrity recognition analysis. You can
get the job identifer from a call to \code{StartCelebrityRecognition}.}

\item{MaxResults}{Maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value greater than 1000,
a maximum of 1000 results is returned. The default value is 1000.}

\item{NextToken}{If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more
recognized celebrities to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a
pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to
retrieve the next set of celebrities.}

\item{SortBy}{Sort to use for celebrities returned in \code{Celebrities} field. Specify
\code{ID} to sort by the celebrity identifier, specify \code{TIMESTAMP} to sort by

\details{
Celebrity recognition in a video is an asynchronous operation. Analysis
is started by a call to StartCelebrityRecognition which returns a job
identifier (\code{JobId}). When the celebrity recognition operation finishes,
Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon
Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to
\code{StartCelebrityRecognition}. To get the results of the celebrity
recognition analysis, first check that the status value published to the
Amazon SNS topic is \code{SUCCEEDED}. If so, call \code{GetCelebrityDetection} and
pass the job identifier (\code{JobId}) from the initial call to
\code{StartCelebrityDetection}.

For more information, see Working With Stored Videos in the Amazon
Rekognition Developer Guide.

\code{GetCelebrityRecognition} returns detected celebrities and the time(s)
they are detected in an array (\code{Celebrities}) of CelebrityRecognition
objects. Each \code{CelebrityRecognition} contains information about the
celebrity in a CelebrityDetail object and the time, \code{Timestamp}, the
celebrity was detected.

\code{GetCelebrityRecognition} only returns the default facial attributes
(\code{BoundingBox}, \code{Confidence}, \code{Landmarks}, \code{Pose}, and \code{Quality}). The
other facial attributes listed in the \code{Face} object of the following
response syntax are not returned. For more information, see FaceDetail
in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

By default, the \code{Celebrities} array is sorted by time (milliseconds from
the start of the video). You can also sort the array by celebrity by
specifying the value \code{ID} in the \code{SortBy} input parameter.

The \code{CelebrityDetail} object includes the celebrity identifer and
additional information urls. If you don\'t store the additional
information urls, you can get them later by calling GetCelebrityInfo
with the celebrity identifer.

No information is returned for faces not recognized as celebrities.

Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If
there are more results than specified in \code{MaxResults}, the value of
\code{NextToken} in the operation response contains a pagination token for
getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call
\code{GetCelebrityDetection} and populate the \code{NextToken} request parameter
with the token value returned from the previous call to
\code{GetCelebrityRecognition}.
