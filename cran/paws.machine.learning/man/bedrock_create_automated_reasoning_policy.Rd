}
\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] A unique name for the Automated Reasoning policy. The name must be
between 1 and 63 characters and can contain letters, numbers, hyphens,
and underscores.}

\item{description}{A description of the Automated Reasoning policy. Use this to provide
context about the policy's purpose and the types of validations it
performs.}

\item{clientRequestToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier to ensure that the operation
completes no more than once. If this token matches a previous request,
Amazon Bedrock ignores the request but doesn't return an error.}

\item{policyDefinition}{The policy definition that contains the formal logic rules, variables,
and custom variable types used to validate foundation model responses in
your application.}

\item{kmsKeyId}{The identifier of the KMS key to use for encrypting the automated
reasoning policy and its associated artifacts. If you don't specify a
KMS key, Amazon Bedrock uses an KMS managed key for encryption. For
enhanced security and control, you can specify a customer managed KMS
key.}

\item{tags}{A list of tags to associate with the Automated Reasoning policy. Tags
help you organize and manage your policies.}
}
\description{
