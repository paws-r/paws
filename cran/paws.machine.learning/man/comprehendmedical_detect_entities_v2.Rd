}
\details{
The \code{DetectEntitiesV2} operation replaces the DetectEntities operation.
This new action uses a different model for determining the entities in
your medical text and changes the way that some entities are returned in
the output. You should use the \code{DetectEntitiesV2} operation in all new
applications.

The \code{DetectEntitiesV2} operation returns the \code{Acuity} and \code{Direction}
entities as attributes instead of types.
