speech synthesis}
\usage{
polly_describe_voices(Engine, LanguageCode,
  IncludeAdditionalLanguageCodes, NextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{Engine}{Specifies the engine (\code{standard} or \code{neural}) used by Amazon Polly when
processing input text for speech synthesis.}

\item{LanguageCode}{The language identification tag (ISO 639 code for the language name-ISO
3166 country code) for filtering the list of voices returned. If you
don\'t specify this optional parameter, all available voices are
returned.}

\item{IncludeAdditionalLanguageCodes}{Boolean value indicating whether to return any bilingual voices that use
the specified language as an additional language. For instance, if you
request all languages that use US English (es-US), and there is an
Italian voice that speaks both Italian (it-IT) and US English, that
voice will be included if you specify \code{yes} but not if you specify \code{no}.}

\item{NextToken}{An opaque pagination token returned from the previous \code{DescribeVoices}
operation. If present, this indicates where to continue the listing.}
}
\description{
Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting
speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male
or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the
voice name.
}
\details{
When synthesizing speech ( \code{SynthesizeSpeech} ), you provide the voice
ID for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by
\code{DescribeVoices}.

For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a
specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice.
Using the \code{DescribeVoices} operation you can provide the user with a
list of available voices to select from.

You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available
voices. For example, if you specify \code{en-US}, the operation returns a
list of all available US English voices.

This operation requires permissions to perform the
\code{polly:DescribeVoices} action.
