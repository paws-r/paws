\title{Creates a new Call Analytics category}
\usage{
transcribeservice_create_call_analytics_category(
  CategoryName,
  Rules,
  Tags = NULL,
  InputType = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CategoryName}{[required] A unique name, chosen by you, for your Call Analytics category. It's
helpful to use a detailed naming system that will make sense to you in
the future. For example, it's better to use
\code{sentiment-positive-last30seconds} for a category over a generic name
like \code{test-category}.

Category names are case sensitive.}

\item{Rules}{[required] Rules define a Call Analytics category. When creating a new category,
you must create between 1 and 20 rules for that category. For each rule,
you specify a filter you want applied to the attributes of a call. For
example, you can choose a sentiment filter that detects if a customer's
sentiment was positive during the last 30 seconds of the call.}

\item{Tags}{Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a
new call analytics category at the time you start this new job.

To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html}{Tagging resources}.}

\item{InputType}{Choose whether you want to create a real-time or a post-call category
for your Call Analytics transcription.

Specifying \code{POST_CALL} assigns your category to post-call
transcriptions; categories with this input type cannot be applied to
streaming (real-time) transcriptions.

Specifying \code{REAL_TIME} assigns your category to streaming
transcriptions; categories with this input type cannot be applied to
post-call transcriptions.

If you do not include \code{InputType}, your category is created as a
post-call category by default.}
