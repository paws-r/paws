  ForecastExportJobName,

  Destination,
  Tags = NULL,
  Format = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ForecastExportJobName}{[required] The name for the forecast export job.}

\item{ForecastArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast that you want to export.}

\item{Destination}{[required] The location where you want to save the forecast and an AWS Identity and
Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
the location. The forecast must be exported to an Amazon S3 bucket.

If encryption is used, \code{Destination} must include an AWS Key Management
Service (KMS) key. The IAM role must allow Amazon Forecast permission to
access the key.}

\item{Tags}{The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast export job to help
you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
\itemize{
\item Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
\item For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
have only one value.
\item Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
\item Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
\item If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
characters: + - = . _ : / @.
\item Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
\item Do not use \verb{aws:}, \verb{AWS:}, or any upper or lowercase combination of
such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot
edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this
prefix. If a tag value has \code{aws} as its prefix but the key does not,
then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against
the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of \code{aws} do not
count against your tags per resource limit.
}}

\item{Format}{The format of the exported data, CSV or PARQUET. The default value is
CSV.}
