\usage{
bedrockagentruntime_list_flow_execution_events(
  eventType,
  executionIdentifier,
  flowAliasIdentifier,
  flowIdentifier,
  maxResults = NULL,
  nextToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{eventType}{[required] The type of events to retrieve. Specify \code{Node} for node-level events or
\code{Flow} for flow-level events.}

\item{executionIdentifier}{[required] The unique identifier of the flow execution.}

\item{flowAliasIdentifier}{[required] The unique identifier of the flow alias used for the execution.}

\item{flowIdentifier}{[required] The unique identifier of the flow.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of events to return in a single response. If more
events exist than the specified maxResults value, a token is included in
the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.}

\item{nextToken}{A token to retrieve the next set of results. This value is returned in
the response if more results are available.}
