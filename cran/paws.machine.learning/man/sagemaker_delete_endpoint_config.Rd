\usage{
sagemaker_delete_endpoint_config(EndpointConfigName)
}
\arguments{
\item{EndpointConfigName}{[required] The name of the endpoint configuration that you want to delete.}
}
\description{
Deletes an endpoint configuration. The \code{DeleteEndpointConfig} API
deletes only the specified configuration. It does not delete endpoints
created using the configuration.

You must not delete an \code{EndpointConfig} in use by an endpoint that is
live or while the \code{UpdateEndpoint} or \code{CreateEndpoint} operations are
being performed on the endpoint. If you delete the \code{EndpointConfig} of
an endpoint that is active or being created or updated you may lose
visibility into the instance type the endpoint is using. The endpoint
must be deleted in order to stop incurring charges.
