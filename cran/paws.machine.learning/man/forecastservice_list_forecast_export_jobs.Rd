\title{Returns a list of forecast export jobs created using the
CreateForecastExportJob operation}
\usage{
forecastservice_list_forecast_export_jobs(
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  Filters = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{NextToken}{If the result of the previous request was truncated, the response
includes a \code{NextToken}. To retrieve the next set of results, use the
token in the next request. Tokens expire after 24 hours.}

\item{MaxResults}{The number of items to return in the response.}

\item{Filters}{An array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and a
match statement. The condition is either \code{IS} or \code{IS_NOT}, which
specifies whether to include or exclude the forecast export jobs that
match the statement from the list, respectively. The match statement
consists of a key and a value.

\strong{Filter properties}
\itemize{
\item \code{Condition} - The condition to apply. Valid values are \code{IS} and
\code{IS_NOT}. To include the forecast export jobs that match the
statement, specify \code{IS}. To exclude matching forecast export jobs,
specify \code{IS_NOT}.
\item \code{Key} - The name of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are
\code{ForecastArn} and \code{Status}.
\item \code{Value} - The value to match.
}

For example, to list all jobs that export a forecast named
\emph{electricityforecast}, specify the following filter:

\verb{"Filters": [ \{ "Condition": "IS", "Key": "ForecastArn", "Value": "arn:aws:forecast:us-west-2:<acct-id>:forecast/electricityforecast" \} ]}}
}
\description{
Returns a list of forecast export jobs created using the \code{\link[=forecastservice_create_forecast_export_job]{create_forecast_export_job}} operation. For each forecast export job, this operation returns a summary of its properties, including its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). To retrieve the complete set of properties, use the ARN with the \code{\link[=forecastservice_describe_forecast_export_job]{describe_forecast_export_job}} operation. You can filter the list using an array of Filter objects.
