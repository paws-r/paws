\arguments{
\item{TranscriptionJobName}{[required] A unique name, chosen by you, for your transcription job. The name that
you specify is also used as the default name of your transcription
output file. If you want to specify a different name for your
transcription output, use the \code{OutputKey} parameter.

This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique
within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a new job
with the same name as an existing job, you get a \code{ConflictException}
error.}

\item{LanguageCode}{The language code that represents the language spoken in the input media
file.

If you're unsure of the language spoken in your media file, consider
using \code{IdentifyLanguage} or \code{IdentifyMultipleLanguages} to enable
automatic language identification.

Note that you must include one of \code{LanguageCode}, \code{IdentifyLanguage}, or
\code{IdentifyMultipleLanguages} in your request. If you include more than
one of these parameters, your transcription job fails.

For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes,
refer to the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html}{Supported languages}
table.

To transcribe speech in Modern Standard Arabic (\code{ar-SA}), your media
file must be encoded at a sample rate of 16,000 Hz or higher.}

\item{MediaSampleRateHertz}{The sample rate, in hertz, of the audio track in your input media file.

If you do not specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe
determines it for you. If you specify the sample rate, it must match the
rate detected by Amazon Transcribe. If there's a mismatch between the
value that you specify and the value detected, your job fails. In most
cases, you can omit \code{MediaSampleRateHertz} and let Amazon Transcribe
determine the sample rate.}

\item{MediaFormat}{Specify the format of your input media file.}

\item{Media}{[required] Describes the Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to use in
your request.}

\item{OutputBucketName}{The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want your transcription
output stored. Do not include the \verb{S3://} prefix of the specified
bucket.

If you want your output to go to a sub-folder of this bucket, specify it
using the \code{OutputKey} parameter; \code{OutputBucketName} only accepts the
name of a bucket.

For example, if you want your output stored in
\verb{S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET}, set \code{OutputBucketName} to
\code{DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET}. However, if you want your output stored in
\verb{S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/}, set \code{OutputBucketName} to
\code{DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET} and \code{OutputKey} to \verb{test-files/}.

Note that Amazon Transcribe must have permission to use the specified
location. You can change Amazon S3 permissions using the Amazon Web
Services Management Console. See also \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#auth-role-iam-user}{Permissions Required for IAM User Roles}.

If you do not specify \code{OutputBucketName}, your transcript is placed in a
service-managed Amazon S3 bucket and you are provided with a URI to
access your transcript.}

\item{OutputKey}{Use in combination with \code{OutputBucketName} to specify the output
location of your transcript and, optionally, a unique name for your
output file. The default name for your transcription output is the same
as the name you specified for your transcription job
(\code{TranscriptionJobName}).

Here are some examples of how you can use \code{OutputKey}:
\itemize{
\item If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the \code{OutputBucketName} and
'my-transcript.json' as the \code{OutputKey}, your transcription output
path is \verb{s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript.json}.
\item If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the
\code{TranscriptionJobName}, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the
\code{OutputBucketName}, and 'my-transcript' as the \code{OutputKey}, your
transcription output path is
\verb{s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json}.
\item If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the \code{OutputBucketName} and
'test-files/my-transcript.json' as the \code{OutputKey}, your
transcription output path is
\verb{s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript.json}.
\item If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the
\code{TranscriptionJobName}, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the
\code{OutputBucketName}, and 'test-files/my-transcript' as the
\code{OutputKey}, your transcription output path is
\verb{s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json}.
}

If you specify the name of an Amazon S3 bucket sub-folder that doesn't
exist, one is created for you.}

\item{OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId}{The KMS key you want to use to encrypt your transcription output.

If using a key located in the \strong{current} Amazon Web Services account,
you can specify your KMS key in one of four ways:
\enumerate{
\item Use the KMS key ID itself. For example,
\verb{1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab}.
\item Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example, \code{alias/ExampleAlias}.
\item Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For example,
\verb{arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab}.
\item Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example,
\code{arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias}.
}

If using a key located in a \strong{different} Amazon Web Services account
than the current Amazon Web Services account, you can specify your KMS
key in one of two ways:
\enumerate{
\item Use the ARN for the KMS key ID. For example,
\verb{arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab}.
\item Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example,
\code{arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias}.
}

If you do not specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with
the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).

If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also specify
an output location using the \code{OutputLocation} parameter.

Note that the role making the request must have permission to use the
specified KMS key.}

\item{KMSEncryptionContext}{A map of plain text, non-secret key:value pairs, known as encryption
context pairs, that provide an added layer of security for your data.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/#kms-context}{KMS encryption context}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/}{Asymmetric keys in KMS}.}

\item{Settings}{Specify additional optional settings in your request, including channel
identification, alternative transcriptions, speaker partitioning. You
can use that to apply custom vocabularies and vocabulary filters.

If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter
(or both) with your request but \strong{do not} want to use automatic
language identification, use \code{Settings} with the \code{VocabularyName} or
\code{VocabularyFilterName} (or both) sub-parameter.

If you're using automatic language identification with your request and
want to include a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a
custom vocabulary filter, use instead the `` parameter with the
\code{LanguageModelName}, `VocabularyName` or `VocabularyFilterName`
sub-parameters.}

\item{ModelSettings}{Specify the custom language model you want to include with your
transcription job. If you include \code{ModelSettings} in your request, you
must include the \code{LanguageModelName} sub-parameter.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/custom-language-models.html}{Custom language models}.}

\item{JobExecutionSettings}{Makes it possible to control how your transcription job is processed.
Currently, the only \code{JobExecutionSettings} modification you can choose
is enabling job queueing using the \code{AllowDeferredExecution}
sub-parameter.

If you include \code{JobExecutionSettings} in your request, you must also
include the sub-parameters: \code{AllowDeferredExecution} and
\code{DataAccessRoleArn}.}

\item{ContentRedaction}{Makes it possible to redact or flag specified personally identifiable
information (PII) in your transcript. If you use \code{ContentRedaction}, you
must also include the sub-parameters: \code{RedactionOutput} and
\code{RedactionType}. You can optionally include \code{PiiEntityTypes} to choose
which types of PII you want to redact. If you do not include
\code{PiiEntityTypes} in your request, all PII is redacted.}

\item{IdentifyLanguage}{Enables automatic language identification in your transcription job
request. Use this parameter if your media file contains only one
language. If your media contains multiple languages, use
\code{IdentifyMultipleLanguages} instead.

If you include \code{IdentifyLanguage}, you can optionally include a list of
language codes, using \code{LanguageOptions}, that you think may be present
in your media file. Including \code{LanguageOptions} restricts
\code{IdentifyLanguage} to only the language options that you specify, which
can improve transcription accuracy.

If you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a
custom vocabulary filter to your automatic language identification
request, include \code{LanguageIdSettings} with the relevant sub-parameters
(\code{VocabularyName}, \code{LanguageModelName}, and \code{VocabularyFilterName}). If
you include \code{LanguageIdSettings}, also include \code{LanguageOptions}.

Note that you must include one of \code{LanguageCode}, \code{IdentifyLanguage}, or
\code{IdentifyMultipleLanguages} in your request. If you include more than
one of these parameters, your transcription job fails.}

\item{IdentifyMultipleLanguages}{Enables automatic multi-language identification in your transcription
job request. Use this parameter if your media file contains more than
one language. If your media contains only one language, use
\code{IdentifyLanguage} instead.

If you include \code{IdentifyMultipleLanguages}, you can optionally include a
list of language codes, using \code{LanguageOptions}, that you think may be
present in your media file. Including \code{LanguageOptions} restricts
\code{IdentifyLanguage} to only the language options that you specify, which
can improve transcription accuracy.

If you want to apply a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter
to your automatic language identification request, include
\code{LanguageIdSettings} with the relevant sub-parameters (\code{VocabularyName}
and \code{VocabularyFilterName}). If you include \code{LanguageIdSettings}, also
include \code{LanguageOptions}.

Note that you must include one of \code{LanguageCode}, \code{IdentifyLanguage}, or
\code{IdentifyMultipleLanguages} in your request. If you include more than
one of these parameters, your transcription job fails.}

\item{LanguageOptions}{You can specify two or more language codes that represent the languages
you think may be present in your media. Including more than five is not
recommended. If you're unsure what languages are present, do not include
this parameter.

If you include \code{LanguageOptions} in your request, you must also include
\code{IdentifyLanguage}.

For more information, refer to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html}{Supported languages}.

To transcribe speech in Modern Standard Arabic (\code{ar-SA}), your media
file must be encoded at a sample rate of 16,000 Hz or higher.}

\item{Subtitles}{Produces subtitle files for your input media. You can specify WebVTT
(\emph{.vtt) and SubRip (}.srt) formats.}

\item{Tags}{Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a
new transcription job at the time you start this new job.

To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html}{Tagging resources}.}

\item{LanguageIdSettings}{If using automatic language identification in your request and you want
to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom
vocabulary filter, include \code{LanguageIdSettings} with the relevant
sub-parameters (\code{VocabularyName}, \code{LanguageModelName}, and
\code{VocabularyFilterName}). Note that multi-language identification
(\code{IdentifyMultipleLanguages}) doesn't support custom language models.

\code{LanguageIdSettings} supports two to five language codes. Each language
code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom
vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes that you
specify must match the languages of the associated custom language
models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

It's recommended that you include \code{LanguageOptions} when using
\code{LanguageIdSettings} to ensure that the correct language dialect is
identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in
\code{en-US} but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken in
your media is \code{en-AU}, your custom vocabulary \emph{is not} applied to your
transcription. If you include \code{LanguageOptions} and include \code{en-US} as
the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary \emph{is} applied
to your transcription.

If you want to include a custom language model with your request but
\strong{do not} want to use automatic language identification, use instead
the \verb{parameter with the `LanguageModelName` sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use instead the} parameter with the \code{VocabularyName}
or \code{VocabularyFilterName} (or both) sub-parameter.}

\item{ToxicityDetection}{Enables toxic speech detection in your transcript. If you include
\code{ToxicityDetection} in your request, you must also include
\code{ToxicityCategories}.

For information on the types of toxic speech Amazon Transcribe can
detect, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/}{Detecting toxic speech}.}
