\usage{
rekognition_create_project_version(
  ProjectArn,
  VersionName,
  OutputConfig,
  TrainingData = NULL,
  TestingData = NULL,
  Tags = NULL,
  KmsKeyId = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ProjectArn}{[required] The ARN of the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project that manages the
model that you want to train.}

\item{VersionName}{[required] A name for the version of the model. This value must be unique.}

\item{OutputConfig}{[required] The Amazon S3 bucket location to store the results of training. The S3
bucket can be in any AWS account as long as the caller has
\code{s3:PutObject} permissions on the S3 bucket.}

\item{TrainingData}{Specifies an external manifest that the services uses to train the
model. If you specify \code{TrainingData} you must also specify
\code{TestingData}. The project must not have any associated datasets.}

\item{TestingData}{Specifies an external manifest that the service uses to test the model.
If you specify \code{TestingData} you must also specify \code{TrainingData}. The
project must not have any associated datasets.}

\item{Tags}{A set of tags (key-value pairs) that you want to attach to the model.}

\item{KmsKeyId}{The identifier for your AWS Key Management Service key (AWS KMS key).
You can supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your KMS key, the ID of
your KMS key, an alias for your KMS key, or an alias ARN. The key is
used to encrypt training and test images copied into the service for
model training. Your source images are unaffected. The key is also used
to encrypt training results and manifest files written to the output
Amazon S3 bucket (\code{OutputConfig}).

If you choose to use your own KMS key, you need the following
permissions on the KMS key.
\itemize{
\item kms:CreateGrant
\item kms:DescribeKey
\item kms:GenerateDataKey
\item kms:Decrypt
}

If you don't specify a value for \code{KmsKeyId}, images copied into the
service are encrypted using a key that AWS owns and manages.}

\description{
Creates a new version of a model and begins training. Models are managed as part of an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project. The response from \code{\link[=rekognition_create_project_version]{create_project_version}} is an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the version of the model.
