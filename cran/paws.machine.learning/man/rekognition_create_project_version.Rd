\title{Creates a new version of a model and begins training}
\usage{
rekognition_create_project_version(ProjectArn, VersionName,
  OutputConfig, TrainingData, TestingData)
}
\arguments{
\item{ProjectArn}{[required] The ARN of the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project that manages the
model that you want to train.}

\item{VersionName}{[required] A name for the version of the model. This value must be unique.}

\item{OutputConfig}{[required] The Amazon S3 location to store the results of training.}

\item{TrainingData}{[required] The dataset to use for training.}

\item{TestingData}{[required] The dataset to use for testing.}
}
\description{
Creates a new version of a model and begins training. Models are managed
as part of an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project. You can specify
one training dataset and one testing dataset. The response from
\code{CreateProjectVersion} is an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the version
of the model.
}
\details{
Training takes a while to complete. You can get the current status by
calling DescribeProjectVersions.

Once training has successfully completed, call DescribeProjectVersions
to get the training results and evaluate the model.

After evaluating the model, you start the model by calling
StartProjectVersion.

This operation requires permissions to perform the
\code{rekognition:CreateProjectVersion} action.
