\description{
Deletes all versions of the bot, including the \verb{$LATEST} version. To delete a specific version of the bot, use the \code{\link[=lexmodelbuildingservice_delete_bot_version]{delete_bot_version}} operation. The \code{\link[=lexmodelbuildingservice_delete_bot]{delete_bot}} operation doesn't immediately remove the bot schema. Instead, it is marked for deletion and removed later.
