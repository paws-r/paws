\usage{
transcribeservice_list_vocabularies(
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  StateEquals = NULL,
  NameContains = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{NextToken}{If your \code{\link[=transcribeservice_list_vocabularies]{list_vocabularies}}
request returns more results than can be displayed, \code{NextToken} is
displayed in the response with an associated string. To get the next
page of results, copy this string and repeat your request, including
\code{NextToken} with the value of the copied string. Repeat as needed to
view all your results.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of custom vocabularies to return in each page of
results. If there are fewer results than the value you specify, only the
actual results are returned. If you don't specify a value, a default of
5 is used.}

\item{StateEquals}{Returns only custom vocabularies with the specified state. Vocabularies
are ordered by creation date, with the newest vocabulary first. If you
don't include \code{StateEquals}, all custom medical vocabularies are
returned.}

\item{NameContains}{Returns only the custom vocabularies that contain the specified string.
The search is not case sensitive.}
