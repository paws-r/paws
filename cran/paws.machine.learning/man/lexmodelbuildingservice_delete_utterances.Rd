\description{
Deletes stored utterances.
}
\details{
Amazon Lex stores the utterances that users send to your bot. Utterances
are stored for 15 days for use with the GetUtterancesView operation, and
then stored indefinitely for use in improving the ability of your bot to
respond to user input.

Use the \code{DeleteUtterances} operation to manually delete stored
utterances for a specific user. When you use the \code{DeleteUtterances}
operation, utterances stored for improving your bot\'s ability to
respond to user input are deleted immediately. Utterances stored for use
with the \code{GetUtterancesView} operation are deleted after 15 days.

This operation requires permissions for the \code{lex:DeleteUtterances}
action.
