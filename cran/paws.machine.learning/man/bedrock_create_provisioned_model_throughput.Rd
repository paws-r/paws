\title{Creates dedicated throughput for a base or custom model with the model
units and for the duration that you specify}
\usage{
bedrock_create_provisioned_model_throughput(
  clientRequestToken = NULL,
  modelUnits,
  provisionedModelName,
  modelId,
  commitmentDuration = NULL,
  tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clientRequestToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier to ensure that the API request
completes no more than one time. If this token matches a previous
request, Amazon Bedrock ignores the request, but does not return an
error. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html}{Ensuring idempotency}
in the Amazon S3 User Guide.}

\item{modelUnits}{[required] Number of model units to allocate. A model unit delivers a specific
throughput level for the specified model. The throughput level of a
model unit specifies the total number of input and output tokens that it
can process and generate within a span of one minute. By default, your
account has no model units for purchasing Provisioned Throughputs with
commitment. You must first visit the Amazon Web Services support center
to request MUs.

For model unit quotas, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html#prov-thru-quotas}{Provisioned Throughput quotas}
in the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html}{Amazon Bedrock User Guide}.

For more information about what an MU specifies, contact your Amazon Web
Services account manager.}

\item{provisionedModelName}{[required] The name for this Provisioned Throughput.}

\item{modelId}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or name of the model to associate with
this Provisioned Throughput. For a list of models for which you can
purchase Provisioned Throughput, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html#prov-throughput-models}{Amazon Bedrock model IDs for purchasing Provisioned Throughput}
in the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html}{Amazon Bedrock User Guide}.}

\item{commitmentDuration}{The commitment duration requested for the Provisioned Throughput.
Billing occurs hourly and is discounted for longer commitment terms. To
request a no-commit Provisioned Throughput, omit this field.

Custom models support all levels of commitment. To see which base models
support no commitment, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/pt-supported.html}{Supported regions and models for Provisioned Throughput}
in the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html}{Amazon Bedrock User Guide}}

\item{tags}{Tags to associate with this Provisioned Throughput.}
