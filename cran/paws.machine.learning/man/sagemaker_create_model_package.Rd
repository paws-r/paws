  ModelPackageName = NULL,
  ModelPackageGroupName = NULL,
  ModelPackageDescription = NULL,
  InferenceSpecification = NULL,
  ValidationSpecification = NULL,
  SourceAlgorithmSpecification = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{ModelPackageName}{The name of the model package. The name must have 1 to 63 characters.
Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and - (hyphen).

This parameter is required for unversioned models. It is not applicable
to versioned models.}

\item{ModelPackageGroupName}{The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model package group that
this model version belongs to.

This parameter is required for versioned models, and does not apply to
unversioned models.}

\item{ModelPackageDescription}{A description of the model package.}

\item{InferenceSpecification}{Specifies details about inference jobs that you can run with models
based on this model package, including the following information:
\itemize{
\item The Amazon ECR paths of containers that contain the inference code
and model artifacts.
\item The instance types that the model package supports for transform
jobs and real-time endpoints used for inference.
\item The input and output content formats that the model package supports
for inference.
}}

\item{ValidationSpecification}{Specifies configurations for one or more transform jobs that SageMaker
runs to test the model package.}

\item{SourceAlgorithmSpecification}{Details about the algorithm that was used to create the model package.}

\item{CertifyForMarketplace}{Whether to certify the model package for listing on Amazon Web Services
Marketplace.

This parameter is optional for unversioned models, and does not apply to
versioned models.}

\item{Tags}{A list of key value pairs associated with the model. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html}{Tagging Amazon Web Services resources}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide}.

If you supply \code{ModelPackageGroupName}, your model package belongs to the
model group you specify and uses the tags associated with the model
group. In this case, you cannot supply a \code{tag} argument.}

\item{ModelApprovalStatus}{Whether the model is approved for deployment.

This parameter is optional for versioned models, and does not apply to
unversioned models.

For versioned models, the value of this parameter must be set to
\code{Approved} to deploy the model.}

\item{MetadataProperties}{}

\item{ModelMetrics}{A structure that contains model metrics reports.}

\item{ClientToken}{A unique token that guarantees that the call to this API is idempotent.}

\item{Domain}{The machine learning domain of your model package and its components.
Common machine learning domains include computer vision and natural
language processing.}

\item{Task}{The machine learning task your model package accomplishes. Common
machine learning tasks include object detection and image
classification. The following tasks are supported by Inference
Recommender: \code{"IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION"} | \code{"OBJECT_DETECTION"} |
\code{"TEXT_GENERATION"} |\code{"IMAGE_SEGMENTATION"} | \code{"FILL_MASK"} |
\code{"CLASSIFICATION"} | \code{"REGRESSION"} | \code{"OTHER"}.

Specify "OTHER" if none of the tasks listed fit your use case.}

\item{SamplePayloadUrl}{The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path where the sample
payload is stored. This path must point to a single gzip compressed tar
archive (.tar.gz suffix). This archive can hold multiple files that are
all equally used in the load test. Each file in the archive must satisfy
the size constraints of the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeEndpoint.html#API_runtime_InvokeEndpoint_RequestSyntax}{InvokeEndpoint}
call.}

\item{CustomerMetadataProperties}{The metadata properties associated with the model package versions.}

\item{DriftCheckBaselines}{Represents the drift check baselines that can be used when the model
monitor is set using the model package. For more information, see the
topic on \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines-quality-clarify-baseline-lifecycle.html#pipelines-quality-clarify-baseline-drift-detection}{Drift Detection against Previous Baselines in SageMaker Pipelines}
in the \emph{Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide}.}

\item{AdditionalInferenceSpecifications}{An array of additional Inference Specification objects. Each additional
Inference Specification specifies artifacts based on this model package
that can be used on inference endpoints. Generally used with SageMaker
Neo to store the compiled artifacts.}

\item{SkipModelValidation}{Indicates if you want to skip model validation.}

\item{SourceUri}{The URI of the source for the model package. If you want to clone a
model package, set it to the model package Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
If you want to register a model, set it to the model ARN.}

\item{SecurityConfig}{The KMS Key ID (\code{KMSKeyId}) used for encryption of model package
information.}

\item{ModelCard}{The model card associated with the model package. Since
\code{ModelPackageModelCard} is tied to a model package, it is a specific
usage of a model card and its schema is simplified compared to the
schema of \code{ModelCard}. The \code{ModelPackageModelCard} schema does not
include \code{model_package_details}, and \code{model_overview} is composed of the
\code{model_creator} and \code{model_artifact} properties. For more information
about the model package model card schema, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry-details.html#model-card-schema}{Model package model card schema}.
For more information about the model card associated with the model
package, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry-details.html}{View the Details of a Model Version}.}

\item{ModelLifeCycle}{A structure describing the current state of the model in its life cycle.}
