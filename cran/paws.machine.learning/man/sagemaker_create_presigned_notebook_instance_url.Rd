\title{Returns a URL that you can use to connect to the Jupyter server from a
notebook instance}
\usage{
sagemaker_create_presigned_notebook_instance_url(NotebookInstanceName,
  SessionExpirationDurationInSeconds)
}
\arguments{
\item{NotebookInstanceName}{[required] The name of the notebook instance.}

\item{SessionExpirationDurationInSeconds}{The duration of the session, in seconds. The default is 12 hours.}
}
\description{
Returns a URL that you can use to connect to the Jupyter server from a
notebook instance. In the Amazon SageMaker console, when you choose
\code{Open} next to a notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker opens a new tab
showing the Jupyter server home page from the notebook instance. The
console uses this API to get the URL and show the page.
}
\details{
IAM authorization policies for this API are also enforced for every HTTP
request and WebSocket frame that attempts to connect to the notebook
instance.For example, you can restrict access to this API and to the URL
that it returns to a list of IP addresses that you specify. Use the
\code{NotIpAddress} condition operator and the \code{aws:SourceIP} condition
context key to specify the list of IP addresses that you want to have
access to the notebook instance. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#nbi-ip-filter}{Limit Access to a Notebook Instance by IP Address}.

The URL that you get from a call to is valid only for 5 minutes. If you
try to use the URL after the 5-minute limit expires, you are directed to
the AWS console sign-in page.
