\title{Replaces specific nodes within a SageMaker HyperPod cluster with new
hardware}
\usage{
sagemaker_batch_replace_cluster_nodes(
  ClusterName,
  NodeIds = NULL,
  NodeLogicalIds = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ClusterName}{[required] The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SageMaker HyperPod cluster
containing the nodes to replace.}

\item{NodeIds}{A list of EC2 instance IDs to replace with new hardware. You can specify
between 1 and 25 instance IDs.

Replace operations destroy all instance volumes (root and secondary).
Ensure you have backed up any important data before proceeding.
\itemize{
\item Either \code{NodeIds} or \code{NodeLogicalIds} must be provided (or both), but
at least one is required.
\item Each instance ID must follow the pattern \verb{i-} followed by 17
hexadecimal characters (for example, \verb{i-0123456789abcdef0}).
\item For SageMaker HyperPod clusters using the Slurm workload manager,
you cannot replace instances that are configured as Slurm controller
nodes.
}}

\item{NodeLogicalIds}{A list of logical node IDs to replace with new hardware. You can specify
between 1 and 25 logical node IDs.

The \code{NodeLogicalId} is a unique identifier that persists throughout the
node's lifecycle and can be used to track nodes that are still being
provisioned and don't yet have an EC2 instance ID assigned.
\itemize{
\item Replace operations destroy all instance volumes (root and
secondary). Ensure you have backed up any important data before
proceeding.
\item This parameter is only supported for clusters using \code{Continuous} as
the \code{NodeProvisioningMode}. For clusters using the default
provisioning mode, use \code{NodeIds} instead.
\item Either \code{NodeIds} or \code{NodeLogicalIds} must be provided (or both), but
at least one is required.

\description{
Replaces specific nodes within a SageMaker HyperPod cluster with new hardware. \code{\link[=sagemaker_batch_replace_cluster_nodes]{batch_replace_cluster_nodes}} terminates the specified instances and provisions new replacement instances with the same configuration but fresh hardware. The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance configuration remain the same.
