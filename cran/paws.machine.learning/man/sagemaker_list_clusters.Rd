\usage{
sagemaker_list_clusters(
  CreationTimeAfter = NULL,
  CreationTimeBefore = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  NameContains = NULL,
  NextToken = NULL,
  SortBy = NULL,
  SortOrder = NULL,
  TrainingPlanArn = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CreationTimeAfter}{Set a start time for the time range during which you want to list
SageMaker HyperPod clusters. Timestamps are formatted according to the
ISO 8601 standard.

Acceptable formats include:
\itemize{
\item \code{YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssTZD} (UTC), for example,
\verb{2014-10-01T20:30:00.000Z}
\item \code{YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssTZD} (with offset), for example,
\verb{2014-10-01T12:30:00.000-08:00}
\item \code{YYYY-MM-DD}, for example, \code{2014-10-01}
\item Unix time in seconds, for example, \code{1412195400}. This is also
referred to as Unix Epoch time and represents the number of seconds
since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
}

For more information about the timestamp format, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-types.html#parameter-type-timestamp}{Timestamp}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide}.}

\item{CreationTimeBefore}{Set an end time for the time range during which you want to list
SageMaker HyperPod clusters. A filter that returns nodes in a SageMaker
HyperPod cluster created before the specified time. The acceptable
formats are the same as the timestamp formats for \code{CreationTimeAfter}.
For more information about the timestamp format, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-types.html#parameter-type-timestamp}{Timestamp}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide}.}

\item{MaxResults}{Set the maximum number of SageMaker HyperPod clusters to list.}

\item{NameContains}{Set the maximum number of instances to print in the list.}

\item{NextToken}{Set the next token to retrieve the list of SageMaker HyperPod clusters.}

\item{SortBy}{The field by which to sort results. The default value is
\code{CREATION_TIME}.}

\item{SortOrder}{The sort order for results. The default value is \code{Ascending}.}

\item{TrainingPlanArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN); of the training plan to filter clusters
by. For more information about reserving GPU capacity for your SageMaker
HyperPod clusters using Amazon SageMaker Training Plan, see
\code{\link[=sagemaker_create_training_plan]{create_training_plan}}.}
