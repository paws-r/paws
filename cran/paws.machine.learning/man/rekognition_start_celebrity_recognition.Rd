\usage{
rekognition_start_celebrity_recognition(
  Video,
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  NotificationChannel = NULL,
  JobTag = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Video}{[required] The video in which you want to recognize celebrities. The video must be
stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use the same
token with multiple
\code{\link[=rekognition_start_celebrity_recognition]{start_celebrity_recognition}}
requests, the same \code{JobId} is returned. Use \code{ClientRequestToken} to
prevent the same job from being accidently started more than once.}

\item{NotificationChannel}{The Amazon SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Rekognition Video to
publish the completion status of the celebrity recognition analysis to.
The Amazon SNS topic must have a topic name that begins with
\emph{AmazonRekognition} if you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole
permissions policy.}

\item{JobTag}{An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notification
that's published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service topic. For
example, you can use \code{JobTag} to group related jobs and identify them in
the completion notification.}
