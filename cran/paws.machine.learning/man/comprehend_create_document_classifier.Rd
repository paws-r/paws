documents}

  DocumentClassifierName,
  VersionName = NULL,
  DataAccessRoleArn,
  Tags = NULL,
  InputDataConfig,
  OutputDataConfig = NULL,

  VolumeKmsKeyId = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{DocumentClassifierName}{[required] The name of the document classifier.}

\item{VersionName}{The version name given to the newly created classifier. Version names
can have a maximum of 256 characters. Alphanumeric characters, hyphens
(-) and underscores (_) are allowed. The version name must be unique
among all models with the same classifier name in the account/AWS
Region.}

\item{DataAccessRoleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Management (IAM)
role that grants Amazon Comprehend read access to your input data.}

\item{Tags}{Tags to be associated with the document classifier being created. A tag
is a key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by Amazon
Comprehend. For example, a tag with "Sales" as the key might be added to
a resource to indicate its use by the sales department.}

\item{InputDataConfig}{[required] Specifies the format and location of the input data for the job.}

\item{OutputDataConfig}{Enables the addition of output results configuration parameters for
custom classifier jobs.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{A unique identifier for the request. If you don't set the client request
token, Amazon Comprehend generates one.}

\item{LanguageCode}{[required] The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the
following languages supported by Amazon Comprehend: German ("de"),
English ("en"), Spanish ("es"), French ("fr"), Italian ("it"), or
Portuguese ("pt"). All documents must be in the same language.}

\item{VolumeKmsKeyId}{ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend
uses to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute
instance(s) that process the analysis job. The VolumeKmsKeyId can be
either of the following formats:
\itemize{
\item KMS Key ID: \code{"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"}
\item Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key:
\code{"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"}
}}

\item{VpcConfig}{Configuration parameters for an optional private Virtual Private Cloud
(VPC) containing the resources you are using for your custom classifier.
For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html}{Amazon VPC}.}

\item{Mode}{Indicates the mode in which the classifier will be trained. The
classifier can be trained in multi-class mode, which identifies one and
only one class for each document, or multi-label mode, which identifies
one or more labels for each document. In multi-label mode, multiple
labels for an individual document are separated by a delimiter. The
default delimiter between labels is a pipe (|).}

\item{ModelKmsKeyId}{ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend
uses to encrypt trained custom models. The ModelKmsKeyId can be either
of the following formats:
\itemize{
\item KMS Key ID: \code{"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"}
\item Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key:
\code{"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"}
}}

\item{ModelPolicy}{The resource-based policy to attach to your custom document classifier
model. You can use this policy to allow another AWS account to import
your custom model.

Provide your policy as a JSON body that you enter as a UTF-8 encoded
string without line breaks. To provide valid JSON, enclose the attribute
names and values in double quotes. If the JSON body is also enclosed in
double quotes, then you must escape the double quotes that are inside
the policy:

\verb{"\{\\"attribute\\": \\"value\\", \\"attribute\\": [\\"value\\"]\}"}

To avoid escaping quotes, you can use single quotes to enclose the
policy and double quotes to enclose the JSON names and values:

\code{'{"attribute": "value", "attribute": ["value"]}'}}
}
\description{
Creates a new document classifier that you can use to categorize documents. To create a classifier, you provide a set of training documents that labeled with the categories that you want to use. After the classifier is trained you can use it to categorize a set of labeled documents into the categories. For more information, see how-document-classification.
