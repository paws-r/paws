\usage{
sagemaker_create_hyper_parameter_tuning_job(
  HyperParameterTuningJobName,
  HyperParameterTuningJobConfig,
  TrainingJobDefinition = NULL,
  TrainingJobDefinitions = NULL,
  WarmStartConfig = NULL,
  Tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{HyperParameterTuningJobName}{[required] The name of the tuning job. This name is the prefix for the names of all
training jobs that this tuning job launches. The name must be unique
within the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services
Region. The name must have 1 to 32 characters. Valid characters are a-z,
A-Z, 0-9, and : + = @ _ \% - (hyphen). The name is not case sensitive.}

\item{HyperParameterTuningJobConfig}{[required] The HyperParameterTuningJobConfig object that describes the tuning job,
including the search strategy, the objective metric used to evaluate
training jobs, ranges of parameters to search, and resource limits for
the tuning job. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning-how-it-works.html}{How Hyperparameter Tuning Works}.}

\item{TrainingJobDefinition}{The HyperParameterTrainingJobDefinition object that describes the
training jobs that this tuning job launches, including static
hyperparameters, input data configuration, output data configuration,
resource configuration, and stopping condition.}

\item{TrainingJobDefinitions}{A list of the HyperParameterTrainingJobDefinition objects launched for
this tuning job.}

\item{WarmStartConfig}{Specifies the configuration for starting the hyperparameter tuning job
using one or more previous tuning jobs as a starting point. The results
of previous tuning jobs are used to inform which combinations of
hyperparameters to search over in the new tuning job.

All training jobs launched by the new hyperparameter tuning job are
evaluated by using the objective metric. If you specify
\code{IDENTICAL_DATA_AND_ALGORITHM} as the \code{WarmStartType} value for the warm
start configuration, the training job that performs the best in the new
tuning job is compared to the best training jobs from the parent tuning
jobs. From these, the training job that performs the best as measured by
the objective metric is returned as the overall best training job.

All training jobs launched by parent hyperparameter tuning jobs and the
new hyperparameter tuning jobs count against the limit of training jobs
for the tuning job.}

\item{Tags}{An array of key-value pairs. You can use tags to categorize your Amazon
Web Services resources in different ways, for example, by purpose,
owner, or environment. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html}{Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources}.

Tags that you specify for the tuning job are also added to all training
jobs that the tuning job launches.}

\description{
Starts a hyperparameter tuning job. A hyperparameter tuning job finds the best version of a model by running many training jobs on your dataset using the algorithm you choose and values for hyperparameters within ranges that you specify. It then chooses the hyperparameter values that result in a model that performs the best, as measured by an objective metric that you choose.
