\title{Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified
collection}
\usage{
rekognition_index_faces(
  CollectionId,
  Image,
  ExternalImageId = NULL,
  DetectionAttributes = NULL,
  MaxFaces = NULL,
  QualityFilter = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CollectionId}{[required] The ID of an existing collection to which you want to add the faces that
are detected in the input images.}

\item{Image}{[required] The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the
AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded
image bytes isn't supported.

If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not
need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the \code{Bytes} field. For
more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.}

\item{ExternalImageId}{The ID you want to assign to all the faces detected in the image.}

\item{DetectionAttributes}{An array of facial attributes that you want to be returned. This can be
the default list of attributes or all attributes. If you don't specify a
value for \code{Attributes} or if you specify \verb{["DEFAULT"]}, the API returns
the following subset of facial attributes: \code{BoundingBox}, \code{Confidence},
\code{Pose}, \code{Quality}, and \code{Landmarks}. If you provide \verb{["ALL"]}, all facial
attributes are returned, but the operation takes longer to complete.

If you provide both, \verb{["ALL", "DEFAULT"]}, the service uses a logical
AND operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all
attributes).}

\item{MaxFaces}{The maximum number of faces to index. The value of \code{MaxFaces} must be
greater than or equal to 1. \code{\link[=rekognition_index_faces]{index_faces}}
returns no more than 100 detected faces in an image, even if you specify
a larger value for \code{MaxFaces}.

If \code{\link[=rekognition_index_faces]{index_faces}} detects more faces than the
value of \code{MaxFaces}, the faces with the lowest quality are filtered out
first. If there are still more faces than the value of \code{MaxFaces}, the
faces with the smallest bounding boxes are filtered out (up to the
number that's needed to satisfy the value of \code{MaxFaces}). Information
about the unindexed faces is available in the \code{UnindexedFaces} array.

The faces that are returned by \code{\link[=rekognition_index_faces]{index_faces}}
are sorted by the largest face bounding box size to the smallest size,
in descending order.

\code{MaxFaces} can be used with a collection associated with any version of
the face model.}

\item{QualityFilter}{A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to
identify faces. Filtered faces aren't indexed. If you specify \code{AUTO},
Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify \code{LOW},
\code{MEDIUM}, or \code{HIGH}, filtering removes all faces that donâ€™t meet the
chosen quality bar. The default value is \code{AUTO}. The quality bar is
based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur
for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's
misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose
that's too extreme to use. If you specify \code{NONE}, no filtering is
performed.

To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be
associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.}
