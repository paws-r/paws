\title{Updates an existing work team with new member definitions or description}
\usage{
sagemaker_update_workteam(WorkteamName, MemberDefinitions, Description,
  NotificationConfiguration)
}
\arguments{
\item{WorkteamName}{[required] The name of the work team to update.}

\item{MemberDefinitions}{A list of \code{MemberDefinition} objects that contains objects that identify
the workers that make up the work team.

Workforces can be created using Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC Identity
Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon Cognito use
\code{CognitoMemberDefinition}. For workforces created using your own OIDC
identity provider (IdP) use \code{OidcMemberDefinition}. You should not
provide input for both of these parameters in a single request.

For workforces created using Amazon Cognito, private work teams
correspond to Amazon Cognito \emph{user groups} within the user pool used to
create a workforce. All of the \code{CognitoMemberDefinition} objects that
make up the member definition must have the same \code{ClientId} and
\code{UserPool} values. To add a Amazon Cognito user group to an existing
worker pool, see Adding groups to a User Pool. For more information
about user pools, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html}{Amazon Cognito User Pools}.

For workforces created using your own OIDC IdP, specify the user groups
that you want to include in your private work team in
\code{OidcMemberDefinition} by listing those groups in \code{Groups}. Be aware
that user groups that are already in the work team must also be listed
in \code{Groups} when you make this request to remain on the work team. If
you do not include these user groups, they will no longer be associated
with the work team you update.}

\item{Description}{An updated description for the work team.}

\item{NotificationConfiguration}{Configures SNS topic notifications for available or expiring work items}
}
\description{
Updates an existing work team with new member definitions or
description.
