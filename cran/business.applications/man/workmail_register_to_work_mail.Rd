\description{
Registers an existing and disabled user, group, or resource for Amazon
WorkMail use by associating a mailbox and calendaring capabilities. It
performs no change if the user, group, or resource is enabled and fails
if the user, group, or resource is deleted. This operation results in
the accumulation of costs. For more information, see
\href{https://aws.amazon.com//workmail/pricing}{Pricing}. The equivalent
console functionality for this operation is \emph{Enable}.
}
\details{
Users can either be created by calling the CreateUser API operation or
they can be synchronized from your directory. For more information, see
