\usage{
lightsail_start_instance(instanceName)
}
\arguments{
\item{instanceName}{[required] The name of the instance (a virtual private server) to start.}
}
\description{
Starts a specific Amazon Lightsail instance from a stopped state. To
restart an instance, use the \verb{reboot instance} operation.
}
\details{
When you start a stopped instance, Lightsail assigns a new public IP
address to the instance. To use the same IP address after stopping and
starting an instance, create a static IP address and attach it to the
instance. For more information, see the \href{https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en/articles/lightsail-create-static-ip}{Lightsail Dev Guide}.

The \verb{start instance} operation supports tag-based access control via
resource tags applied to the resource identified by \verb{instance name}. For
more information, see the \href{https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags}{Lightsail Dev Guide}.
