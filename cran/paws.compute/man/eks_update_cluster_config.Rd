\title{Updates an Amazon EKS cluster configuration}
\usage{
eks_update_cluster_config(
  name,
  resourcesVpcConfig = NULL,
  logging = NULL,
  clientRequestToken = NULL,
  accessConfig = NULL,
  upgradePolicy = NULL,
  zonalShiftConfig = NULL,
  computeConfig = NULL,
  kubernetesNetworkConfig = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] The name of the Amazon EKS cluster to update.}

\item{resourcesVpcConfig}{}

\item{logging}{Enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your
cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs
aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html}{Amazon EKS cluster control plane logs}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide} .

CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates
apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/}{CloudWatch Pricing}.}

\item{clientRequestToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request.}

\item{accessConfig}{The access configuration for the cluster.}

\item{upgradePolicy}{You can enable or disable extended support for clusters currently on
standard support. You cannot disable extended support once it starts.
You must enable extended support before your cluster exits standard
support.}

\item{zonalShiftConfig}{Enable or disable ARC zonal shift for the cluster. If zonal shift is
enabled, Amazon Web Services configures zonal autoshift for the cluster.

Zonal shift is a feature of Amazon Application Recovery Controller
(ARC). ARC zonal shift is designed to be a temporary measure that allows
you to move traffic for a resource away from an impaired AZ until the
zonal shift expires or you cancel it. You can extend the zonal shift if
necessary.

You can start a zonal shift for an EKS cluster, or you can allow Amazon
Web Services to do it for you by enabling \emph{zonal autoshift}. This shift
updates the flow of east-to-west network traffic in your cluster to only
consider network endpoints for Pods running on worker nodes in healthy
AZs. Additionally, any ALB or NLB handling ingress traffic for
applications in your EKS cluster will automatically route traffic to
targets in the healthy AZs. For more information about zonal shift in
EKS, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/zone-shift.html}{Learn about Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Zonal Shift in Amazon EKS}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide} .}

\item{computeConfig}{Update the configuration of the compute capability of your EKS Auto Mode
cluster. For example, enable the capability.}

\item{kubernetesNetworkConfig}{}

\item{storageConfig}{Update the configuration of the block storage capability of your EKS
Auto Mode cluster. For example, enable the capability.}

Updates an Amazon EKS cluster configuration. Your cluster continues to function during the update. The response output includes an update ID that you can use to track the status of your cluster update with \code{\link[=eks_describe_update]{describe_update}}"/\>.
