\item{state}{[required] The alarm state to test.

An alarm has the following possible states that can be tested:
\itemize{
\item \code{ALARM} - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.
\item \code{INSUFFICIENT_DATA} - The alarm has just started, the metric is not
available, or not enough data is available for the metric to
determine the alarm state.

}
\description{
Tests an alarm by displaying a banner on the Amazon Lightsail console.
If a notification trigger is configured for the specified alarm, the
test also sends a notification to the notification protocol (\code{Email}
and/or \code{SMS}) configured for the alarm.

An alarm is used to monitor a single metric for one of your resources.
When a metric condition is met, the alarm can notify you by email, SMS
text message, and a banner displayed on the Amazon Lightsail console.
For more information, see Alarms in Amazon Lightsail.
