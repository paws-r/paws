\arguments{
\item{Ipv4Prefixes}{The IPv4 prefixes assigned to the network interface.

You can't specify IPv4 prefixes if you've specified one of the
following: a count of IPv4 prefixes, specific private IPv4 addresses, or
a count of private IPv4 addresses.}

\item{Ipv4PrefixCount}{The number of IPv4 prefixes that Amazon Web Services automatically
assigns to the network interface.

You can't specify a count of IPv4 prefixes if you've specified one of
the following: specific IPv4 prefixes, specific private IPv4 addresses,
or a count of private IPv4 addresses.}

\item{Ipv6Prefixes}{The IPv6 prefixes assigned to the network interface.

You can't specify IPv6 prefixes if you've specified one of the
following: a count of IPv6 prefixes, specific IPv6 addresses, or a count
of IPv6 addresses.}

\item{Ipv6PrefixCount}{The number of IPv6 prefixes that Amazon Web Services automatically
assigns to the network interface.

You can't specify a count of IPv6 prefixes if you've specified one of
the following: specific IPv6 prefixes, specific IPv6 addresses, or a
count of IPv6 addresses.}

\item{InterfaceType}{The type of network interface. The default is \code{interface}.

If you specify \code{efa-only}, do not assign any IP addresses to the network
interface. EFA-only network interfaces do not support IP addresses.

The only supported values are \code{interface}, \code{efa}, \code{efa-only}, and
\code{trunk}.}

\item{TagSpecifications}{The tags to apply to the new network interface.}

\item{ClientToken}{Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html}{Ensuring idempotency}.}

\item{EnablePrimaryIpv6}{If youâ€™re creating a network interface in a dual-stack or IPv6-only
subnet, you have the option to assign a primary IPv6 IP address. A
primary IPv6 address is an IPv6 GUA address associated with an ENI that
you have enabled to use a primary IPv6 address. Use this option if the
instance that this ENI will be attached to relies on its IPv6 address
not changing. Amazon Web Services will automatically assign an IPv6
address associated with the ENI attached to your instance to be the
primary IPv6 address. Once you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a
primary IPv6, you cannot disable it. When you enable an IPv6 GUA address
to be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA will be made the primary IPv6
address until the instance is terminated or the network interface is
detached. If you have multiple IPv6 addresses associated with an ENI
attached to your instance and you enable a primary IPv6 address, the
first IPv6 GUA address associated with the ENI becomes the primary IPv6
address.}

\item{ConnectionTrackingSpecification}{A connection tracking specification for the network interface.}

\item{Operator}{Reserved for internal use.}

\item{SubnetId}{[required] The ID of the subnet to associate with the network interface.}

\item{Description}{A description for the network interface.}

\item{PrivateIpAddress}{The primary private IPv4 address of the network interface. If you don't
specify an IPv4 address, Amazon EC2 selects one for you from the
subnet's IPv4 CIDR range. If you specify an IP address, you cannot
indicate any IP addresses specified in \code{privateIpAddresses} as primary
(only one IP address can be designated as primary).}

\item{Groups}{The IDs of one or more security groups.}

\item{PrivateIpAddresses}{The private IPv4 addresses.

You can't specify private IPv4 addresses if you've specified one of the
following: a count of private IPv4 addresses, specific IPv4 prefixes, or
a count of IPv4 prefixes.}

\item{SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount}{The number of secondary private IPv4 addresses to assign to a network
interface. When you specify a number of secondary IPv4 addresses, Amazon
EC2 selects these IP addresses within the subnet's IPv4 CIDR range. You
can't specify this option and specify more than one private IP address
using \code{privateIpAddresses}.

You can't specify a count of private IPv4 addresses if you've specified
one of the following: specific private IPv4 addresses, specific IPv4
prefixes, or a count of IPv4 prefixes.}

\item{Ipv6Addresses}{The IPv6 addresses from the IPv6 CIDR block range of your subnet.

You can't specify IPv6 addresses using this parameter if you've
specified one of the following: a count of IPv6 addresses, specific IPv6
prefixes, or a count of IPv6 prefixes.}

\item{Ipv6AddressCount}{The number of IPv6 addresses to assign to a network interface. Amazon
EC2 automatically selects the IPv6 addresses from the subnet range.

You can't specify a count of IPv6 addresses using this parameter if
you've specified one of the following: specific IPv6 addresses, specific
IPv6 prefixes, or a count of IPv6 prefixes.

If your subnet has the \code{AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation} attribute set, you
can override that setting by specifying 0 as the IPv6 address count.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}
