\usage{
batch_update_job_queue(
  jobQueue,
  state = NULL,
  schedulingPolicyArn = NULL,
  priority = NULL,
  computeEnvironmentOrder = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{jobQueue}{[required] The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.}

\item{state}{Describes the queue's ability to accept new jobs. If the job queue state
is \code{ENABLED}, it can accept jobs. If the job queue state is \code{DISABLED},
new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can
finish.}

\item{schedulingPolicyArn}{Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair share scheduling policy. Once a
job queue is created, the fair share scheduling policy can be replaced
but not removed. The format is
\code{aws:Partition:batch:Region:Account:scheduling-policy/Name }. For
example,
\code{aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:012345678910:scheduling-policy/MySchedulingPolicy}.}

\item{priority}{The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a
higher integer value for the \code{priority} parameter) are evaluated first
when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is
determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority
value of \code{10} is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a
priority value of \code{1}. All of the compute environments must be either
EC2 (\code{EC2} or \code{SPOT}) or Fargate (\code{FARGATE} or \code{FARGATE_SPOT}). EC2 and
Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.}

\item{computeEnvironmentOrder}{Details the set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their
order relative to each other. This is one of the parameters used by the
job scheduler to determine which compute environment runs a given job.
Compute environments must be in the \code{VALID} state before you can
associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be
either EC2 (\code{EC2} or \code{SPOT}) or Fargate (\code{FARGATE} or \code{FARGATE_SPOT}).
EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share
the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment
architecture types in a single job queue.}
