\usage{
ec2_modify_capacity_reservation_fleet(
  CapacityReservationFleetId,
  TotalTargetCapacity = NULL,
  EndDate = NULL,
  DryRun = NULL,
  RemoveEndDate = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CapacityReservationFleetId}{[required] The ID of the Capacity Reservation Fleet to modify.}

\item{TotalTargetCapacity}{The total number of capacity units to be reserved by the Capacity
Reservation Fleet. This value, together with the instance type weights
that you assign to each instance type used by the Fleet determine the
number of instances for which the Fleet reserves capacity. Both values
are based on units that make sense for your workload. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/crfleet-concepts.html#target-capacity}{Total target capacity}
in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.}

\item{EndDate}{The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation Fleet expires. When
the Capacity Reservation Fleet expires, its state changes to \code{expired}
and all of the Capacity Reservations in the Fleet expire.

The Capacity Reservation Fleet expires within an hour after the
specified time. For example, if you specify \code{5/31/2019}, \code{13:30:55}, the
Capacity Reservation Fleet is guaranteed to expire between \code{13:30:55}
and \code{14:30:55} on \code{5/31/2019}.

You can't specify \strong{EndDate} and \strong{RemoveEndDate} in the same request.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{RemoveEndDate}{Indicates whether to remove the end date from the Capacity Reservation
Fleet. If you remove the end date, the Capacity Reservation Fleet does
not expire and it remains active until you explicitly cancel it using
the \strong{CancelCapacityReservationFleet} action.

You can't specify \strong{RemoveEndDate} and \strong{EndDate} in the same request.}
