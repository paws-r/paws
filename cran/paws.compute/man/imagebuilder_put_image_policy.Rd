\description{
Applies a policy to an image. We recommend that you call the RAM API \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_CreateResourceShare.html}{CreateResourceShare} to share resources. If you call the Image Builder API \code{\link[=imagebuilder_put_image_policy]{put_image_policy}}, you must also call the RAM API \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.html}{PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy} in order for the resource to be visible to all principals with whom the resource is shared.
