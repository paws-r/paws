\usage{
ec2_describe_elastic_gpus(ElasticGpuIds, DryRun, Filters, MaxResults,
  NextToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{ElasticGpuIds}{The Elastic Graphics accelerator IDs.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item \code{availability-zone} - The Availability Zone in which the Elastic
Graphics accelerator resides.
\item \code{elastic-gpu-health} - The status of the Elastic Graphics
accelerator (\code{OK} \\| \code{IMPAIRED}).
\item \code{elastic-gpu-state} - The state of the Elastic Graphics accelerator
(\code{ATTACHED}).
\item \code{elastic-gpu-type} - The type of Elastic Graphics accelerator; for
example, \code{eg1.medium}.
\item \code{instance-id} - The ID of the instance to which the Elastic Graphics
accelerator is associated.
}}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve
