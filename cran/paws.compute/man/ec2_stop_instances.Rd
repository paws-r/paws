\usage{
ec2_stop_instances(InstanceIds, Hibernate = NULL, DryRun = NULL, Force = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{InstanceIds}{[required] The IDs of the instances.}

\item{Hibernate}{Hibernates the instance if the instance was enabled for hibernation at
launch. If the instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown
occurs. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html}{Hibernate your instance}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}.

Default: \code{false}}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the operation,
without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If
you have the required permissions, the error response is
\code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{Force}{Forces the instance to stop. The instance will first attempt a graceful
shutdown, which includes flushing file system caches and metadata. If
the graceful shutdown fails to complete within the timeout period, the
instance shuts down forcibly without flushing the file system caches and
metadata.

After using this option, you must perform file system check and repair
procedures. This option is not recommended for Windows instances. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html}{Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 instance stop issues}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}.

Default: \code{false}}
