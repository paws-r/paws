\arguments{
\item{FunctionName}{[required] The name or ARN of the Lambda function.

\strong{Name formats}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Function name} – \verb{my-function}.
\item \strong{Function ARN} –
\verb{arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function}.
\item \strong{Partial ARN} – \verb{123456789012:function:my-function}.
}

The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only
the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.}

\item{Role}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function's execution role.}

\item{Handler}{The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to run your
function. Handler is required if the deployment package is a .zip file
archive. The format includes the file name. It can also include
namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-progmodel.html}{Lambda programming model}.}

\item{Description}{A description of the function.}

\item{Timeout}{The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda allows a function to run
before stopping it. The default is 3 seconds. The maximum allowed value
is 900 seconds. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtime-environment.html}{Lambda execution environment}.}

\item{MemorySize}{The amount of \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-functions.html#configuration-memory-console}{memory available to the function}
at runtime. Increasing the function memory also increases its CPU
allocation. The default value is 128 MB. The value can be any multiple
of 1 MB.}

\item{VpcConfig}{For network connectivity to Amazon Web Services resources in a VPC,
specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC. When you
connect a function to a VPC, it can access resources and the internet
only through that VPC. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html}{Configuring a Lambda function to access resources in a VPC}.}

\item{Environment}{Environment variables that are accessible from function code during
execution.}

\item{Runtime}{The identifier of the function's
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html}{runtime}.
Runtime is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive.
Specifying a runtime results in an error if you're deploying a function
using a container image.

The following list includes deprecated runtimes. Lambda blocks creating
new functions and updating existing functions shortly after each runtime
is deprecated. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtime-deprecation-levels}{Runtime use after deprecation}.

For a list of all currently supported runtimes, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtimes-supported}{Supported runtimes}.}

\item{DeadLetterConfig}{A dead-letter queue configuration that specifies the queue or topic
where Lambda sends asynchronous events when they fail processing. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq}{Dead-letter queues}.}

\item{KMSKeyArn}{The ARN of the Key Management Service (KMS) customer managed key that's
used to encrypt the following resources:
\itemize{
\item The function's \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-encryption}{environment variables}.
\item The function's \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart-security.html}{Lambda SnapStart}
snapshots.
\item When used with \code{SourceKMSKeyArn}, the unzipped version of the .zip
deployment package that's used for function invocations. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/encrypt-zip-package.html#enable-zip-custom-encryption}{Specifying a customer managed key for Lambda}.
\item The optimized version of the container image that's used for
function invocations. Note that this is not the same key that's used
to protect your container image in the Amazon Elastic Container
Registry (Amazon ECR). For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#images-lifecycle}{Function lifecycle}.
}

If you don't provide a customer managed key, Lambda uses an \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk}{Amazon Web Services owned key}
or an \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk}{Amazon Web Services managed key}.}

\item{TracingConfig}{Set \code{Mode} to \code{Active} to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests
with
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html}{X-Ray}.}

\item{RevisionId}{Update the function only if the revision ID matches the ID that's
specified. Use this option to avoid modifying a function that has
changed since you last read it.}

\item{Layers}{A list of \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/chapter-layers.html}{function layers}
to add to the function's execution environment. Specify each layer by
its ARN, including the version.}

\item{FileSystemConfigs}{Connection settings for an Amazon EFS file system.}

\item{ImageConfig}{\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#images-parms}{Container image configuration values}
that override the values in the container image Docker file.}

\item{EphemeralStorage}{The size of the function's \verb{/tmp} directory in MB. The default value is
512, but can be any whole number between 512 and 10,240 MB. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-functions.html#configuration-ephemeral-storage}{Configuring ephemeral storage (console)}.}

\item{SnapStart}{The function's
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html}{SnapStart}
setting.}

\item{LoggingConfig}{The function's Amazon CloudWatch Logs configuration settings.}
