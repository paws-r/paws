\arguments{
\item{FunctionName}{[required] The name of the Lambda function.

\strong{Name formats}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Function name} - \verb{my-function}.
\item \strong{Function ARN} -
\verb{arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function}.
\item \strong{Partial ARN} - \verb{123456789012:function:my-function}.
}

The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only
the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.}

\item{Role}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function's execution role.}

\item{Handler}{The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to execute
your function. Handler is required if the deployment package is a .zip
file archive. The format includes the file name. It can also include
namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-features.html}{Programming Model}.}

\item{Description}{A description of the function.}

\item{Timeout}{The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda allows a function to run
before stopping it. The default is 3 seconds. The maximum allowed value
is 900 seconds. For additional information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtime-environment.html}{Lambda execution environment}.}

\item{MemorySize}{The amount of \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html}{memory available to the function}
at runtime. Increasing the function memory also increases its CPU
allocation. The default value is 128 MB. The value can be any multiple
of 1 MB.}

\item{VpcConfig}{For network connectivity to Amazon Web Services resources in a VPC,
specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC. When you
connect a function to a VPC, it can only access resources and the
internet through that VPC. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html}{VPC Settings}.}

\item{Environment}{Environment variables that are accessible from function code during
execution.}

\item{Runtime}{The identifier of the function's
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html}{runtime}.
Runtime is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive.}

\item{DeadLetterConfig}{A dead letter queue configuration that specifies the queue or topic
where Lambda sends asynchronous events when they fail processing. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#dlq}{Dead Letter Queues}.}

\item{KMSKeyArn}{The ARN of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key
that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. If it's
not provided, Lambda uses a default service key.}

\item{TracingConfig}{Set \code{Mode} to \code{Active} to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests
with
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html}{X-Ray}.}

\item{RevisionId}{Only update the function if the revision ID matches the ID that's
specified. Use this option to avoid modifying a function that has
changed since you last read it.}

\item{Layers}{A list of \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html}{function layers}
to add to the function's execution environment. Specify each layer by
its ARN, including the version.}

\item{FileSystemConfigs}{Connection settings for an Amazon EFS file system.}

\item{ImageConfig}{\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/}{Container image configuration values} that override the
values in the container image Docker file.}

\item{EphemeralStorage}{The size of the functionâ€™s /tmp directory in MB. The default value is
512, but can be any whole number between 512 and 10240 MB.}
