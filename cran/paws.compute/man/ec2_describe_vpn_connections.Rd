\arguments{
\item{Filters}{One or more filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{customer-gateway-configuration} - The configuration information for
the customer gateway.
\item \code{customer-gateway-id} - The ID of a customer gateway associated with
the VPN connection.
\item \code{state} - The state of the VPN connection (\code{pending} | \code{available} |
\code{deleting} | \code{deleted}).
\item \code{option.static-routes-only} - Indicates whether the connection has
static routes only. Used for devices that do not support Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP).
\item \code{route.destination-cidr-block} - The destination CIDR block. This
corresponds to the subnet used in a customer data center.
\item \code{bgp-asn} - The BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) associated with a
BGP device.
\item \code{tag}:\<key\> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag
with the key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for
the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{type} - The type of VPN connection. Currently the only supported
type is \code{ipsec.1}.
\item \code{vpn-connection-id} - The ID of the VPN connection.
\item \code{vpn-gateway-id} - The ID of a virtual private gateway associated
with the VPN connection.
\item \code{transit-gateway-id} - The ID of a transit gateway associated with
the VPN connection.

\item{VpnConnectionIds}{One or more VPN connection IDs.

Default: Describes your VPN connections.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}
