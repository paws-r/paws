the Reserved Instance Marketplace are listed.
\item \code{product-description} - The Reserved Instance product platform
description (\code{Linux/UNIX} | \verb{Linux with SQL Server Standard} |

\description{
Describes Reserved Instance offerings that are available for purchase. With Reserved Instances, you purchase the right to launch instances for a period of time. During that time period, you do not receive insufficient capacity errors, and you pay a lower usage rate than the rate charged for On-Demand instances for the actual time used.
