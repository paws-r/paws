\usage{
ecr_describe_image_scan_findings(
  registryId = NULL,
  repositoryName,
  imageId,
  nextToken = NULL,
  maxResults = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{registryId}{The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry that
contains the repository in which to describe the image scan findings
for. If you do not specify a registry, the default registry is assumed.}

\item{repositoryName}{[required] The repository for the image for which to describe the scan findings.}

\item{imageId}{[required]}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=ecr_describe_image_scan_findings]{describe_image_scan_findings}}
request where \code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value
of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous
results that returned the \code{nextToken} value. This value is null when
there are no more results to return.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of image scan results returned by
\code{\link[=ecr_describe_image_scan_findings]{describe_image_scan_findings}} in
paginated output. When this parameter is used,
\code{\link[=ecr_describe_image_scan_findings]{describe_image_scan_findings}} only
returns \code{maxResults} results in a single page along with a \code{nextToken}
response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be
seen by sending another
\code{\link[=ecr_describe_image_scan_findings]{describe_image_scan_findings}}
request with the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1
and 1000. If this parameter is not used, then
\code{\link[=ecr_describe_image_scan_findings]{describe_image_scan_findings}}
returns up to 100 results and a \code{nextToken} value, if applicable.}
