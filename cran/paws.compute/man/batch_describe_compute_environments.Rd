\usage{
batch_describe_compute_environments(
  computeEnvironments = NULL,
  maxResults = NULL,
  nextToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{computeEnvironments}{A list of up to 100 compute environment names or full Amazon Resource
Name (ARN) entries.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of cluster results returned by
\code{\link[=batch_describe_compute_environments]{describe_compute_environments}}
in paginated output. When this parameter is used,
\code{\link[=batch_describe_compute_environments]{describe_compute_environments}}
only returns \code{maxResults} results in a single page along with a
\code{nextToken} response element. The remaining results of the initial
request can be seen by sending another
\code{\link[=batch_describe_compute_environments]{describe_compute_environments}}
request with the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1
and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then
\code{\link[=batch_describe_compute_environments]{describe_compute_environments}}
returns up to 100 results and a \code{nextToken} value if applicable.}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=batch_describe_compute_environments]{describe_compute_environments}}
request where \code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value
of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous
results that returned the \code{nextToken} value. This value is \code{null} when
there are no more results to return.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to
retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
purposes.}
