\title{Describes one or more of your job queues}
\usage{
batch_describe_job_queues(
  jobQueues = NULL,
  maxResults = NULL,
  nextToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{jobQueues}{A list of up to 100 queue names or full queue Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
entries.}

\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of results returned by
\code{\link[=batch_describe_job_queues]{describe_job_queues}} in paginated output.
When this parameter is used,
\code{\link[=batch_describe_job_queues]{describe_job_queues}} only returns
\code{maxResults} results in a single page and a \code{nextToken} response
element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by
sending another \code{\link[=batch_describe_job_queues]{describe_job_queues}}
request with the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1
and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then
\code{\link[=batch_describe_job_queues]{describe_job_queues}} returns up to 100
results and a \code{nextToken} value if applicable.}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=batch_describe_job_queues]{describe_job_queues}} request where
\code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value of that
parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results
that returned the \code{nextToken} value. This value is \code{null} when there are
no more results to return.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to
retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
purposes.}
