ec2_modify_instance_placement(
  GroupName = NULL,
  PartitionNumber = NULL,
  HostResourceGroupArn = NULL,
  GroupId = NULL,
  InstanceId,
  Tenancy = NULL,
  Affinity = NULL,
  HostId = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{GroupName}{The name of the placement group in which to place the instance. For
spread placement groups, the instance must have a tenancy of \code{default}.
For cluster and partition placement groups, the instance must have a
tenancy of \code{default} or \code{dedicated}.

To remove an instance from a placement group, specify an empty string
("").}

\item{PartitionNumber}{The number of the partition in which to place the instance. Valid only
if the placement group strategy is set to \code{partition}.}

\item{HostResourceGroupArn}{The ARN of the host resource group in which to place the instance. The
instance must have a tenancy of \code{host} to specify this parameter.}

\item{GroupId}{The Group Id of a placement group. You must specify the Placement Group
\strong{Group Id} to launch an instance in a shared placement group.}

\item{InstanceId}{[required] The ID of the instance that you are modifying.}

\item{Tenancy}{The tenancy for the instance.

For T3 instances, you must launch the instance on a Dedicated Host to
use a tenancy of \code{host}. You can't change the tenancy from \code{host} to
\code{dedicated} or \code{default}. Attempting to make one of these unsupported
tenancy changes results in an \code{InvalidRequest} error code.}

\item{Affinity}{The affinity setting for the instance. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/#dedicated-hosts-affinity}{Host affinity}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}.}

\item{HostId}{The ID of the Dedicated Host with which to associate the instance.}
