\usage{
ec2_create_vpc_block_public_access_exclusion(
  DryRun = NULL,
  SubnetId = NULL,
  VpcId = NULL,
  InternetGatewayExclusionMode,
  TagSpecifications = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{SubnetId}{A subnet ID.}

\item{VpcId}{A VPC ID.}

\item{InternetGatewayExclusionMode}{[required] The exclusion mode for internet gateway traffic.
\itemize{
\item \code{allow-bidirectional}: Allow all internet traffic to and from the
excluded VPCs and subnets.
\item \code{allow-egress}: Allow outbound internet traffic from the excluded
VPCs and subnets. Block inbound internet traffic to the excluded
VPCs and subnets. Only applies when VPC Block Public Access is set
to Bidirectional.
}}

\item{TagSpecifications}{\code{tag} - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use
the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value.
For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key \code{Owner}
and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for the filter name and
\code{TeamA} for the filter value.}

\description{
Create a VPC Block Public Access (BPA) exclusion. A VPC BPA exclusion is a mode that can be applied to a single VPC or subnet that exempts it from the accountâ€™s BPA mode and will allow bidirectional or egress-only access. You can create BPA exclusions for VPCs and subnets even when BPA is not enabled on the account to ensure that there is no traffic disruption to the exclusions when VPC BPA is turned on. To learn more about VPC BPA, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html}{Block public access to VPCs and subnets} in the \emph{Amazon VPC User Guide}.
