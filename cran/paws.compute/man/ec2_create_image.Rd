\title{Creates an Amazon EBS-backed AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance that
is either running or stopped}
\usage{
ec2_create_image(
  TagSpecifications = NULL,
  SnapshotLocation = NULL,
  DryRun = NULL,
  InstanceId,
  Name,
  Description = NULL,
  NoReboot = NULL,
  BlockDeviceMappings = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{TagSpecifications}{The tags to apply to the AMI and snapshots on creation. You can tag the
AMI, the snapshots, or both.
\itemize{
\item To tag the AMI, the value for \code{ResourceType} must be \code{image}.
\item To tag the snapshots that are created of the root volume and of
other Amazon EBS volumes that are attached to the instance, the
value for \code{ResourceType} must be \code{snapshot}. The same tag is applied
to all of the snapshots that are created.
}

If you specify other values for \code{ResourceType}, the request fails.

To tag an AMI or snapshot after it has been created, see
\code{\link[=ec2_create_tags]{create_tags}}.}

\item{SnapshotLocation}{Only supported for instances in Local Zones. If the source instance is
not in a Local Zone, omit this parameter.

The Amazon S3 location where the snapshots will be stored.
\itemize{
\item To create local snapshots in the same Local Zone as the source
instance, specify \code{local}.
\item To create regional snapshots in the parent Region of the Local Zone,
specify \code{regional} or omit this parameter.
}

Default: \code{regional}}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{InstanceId}{[required] The ID of the instance.}

\item{Name}{[required] A name for the new image.

Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square
brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.), slashes (/), dashes (-),
single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)}

\item{Description}{A description for the new image.}

\item{NoReboot}{Indicates whether or not the instance should be automatically rebooted
before creating the image. Specify one of the following values:
\itemize{
\item \code{true} - The instance is not rebooted before creating the image.
This creates crash-consistent snapshots that include only the data
that has been written to the volumes at the time the snapshots are
created. Buffered data and data in memory that has not yet been
written to the volumes is not included in the snapshots.
\item \code{false} - The instance is rebooted before creating the image. This
ensures that all buffered data and data in memory is written to the
volumes before the snapshots are created.
}

Default: \code{false}}

\item{BlockDeviceMappings}{The block device mappings.

When using the CreateImage action:
\itemize{
\item You can't change the volume size using the VolumeSize parameter. If
you want a different volume size, you must first change the volume
size of the source instance.
\item You can't modify the encryption status of existing volumes or
snapshots. To create an AMI with volumes or snapshots that have a
different encryption status (for example, where the source volume
and snapshots are unencrypted, and you want to create an AMI with
encrypted volumes or snapshots), copy the image instead.
\item The only option that can be changed for existing mappings or
snapshots is \code{DeleteOnTermination}.
