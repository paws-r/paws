\usage{
lambda_checkpoint_durable_execution(
  DurableExecutionArn,
  CheckpointToken,
  Updates = NULL,
  ClientToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DurableExecutionArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the durable execution.}

\item{CheckpointToken}{[required] A unique token that identifies the current checkpoint state. This token
is provided by the Lambda runtime and must be used to ensure checkpoints
are applied in the correct order. Each checkpoint operation consumes
this token and returns a new one.}

\item{Updates}{An array of state updates to apply during this checkpoint. Each update
represents a change to the execution state, such as completing a step,
starting a callback, or scheduling a timer. Updates are applied
atomically as part of the checkpoint operation.}

\item{ClientToken}{An optional idempotency token to ensure that duplicate checkpoint
requests are handled correctly. If provided, Lambda uses this token to
detect and handle duplicate requests within a 15-minute window.}
}
\description{
Saves the progress of a \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/durable-functions.html}{durable function} execution during runtime. This API is used by the Lambda durable functions SDK to checkpoint completed steps and schedule asynchronous operations. You typically don't need to call this API directly as the SDK handles checkpointing automatically.
