\description{
Modify the auto-placement setting of a Dedicated Host. When auto-placement is enabled, any instances that you launch with a tenancy of \code{host} but without a specific host ID are placed onto any available Dedicated Host in your account that has auto-placement enabled. When auto-placement is disabled, you need to provide a host ID to have the instance launch onto a specific host. If no host ID is provided, the instance is launched onto a suitable host with auto-placement enabled.
