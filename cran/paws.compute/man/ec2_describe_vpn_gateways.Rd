\usage{
ec2_describe_vpn_gateways(Filters, VpnGatewayIds, DryRun)
}
\arguments{
\item{Filters}{One or more filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{amazon-side-asn} - The Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the
Amazon side of the gateway.
\item \code{attachment.state} - The current state of the attachment between the
gateway and the VPC (\code{attaching} \\| \code{attached} \\| \code{detaching} \\|
\code{detached}).
\item \code{attachment.vpc-id} - The ID of an attached VPC.
\item \code{availability-zone} - The Availability Zone for the virtual private
gateway (if applicable).
\item \code{state} - The state of the virtual private gateway (\code{pending} \\|
\code{available} \\| \code{deleting} \\| \code{deleted}).
\item \code{tag}:\\<key\\> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag
with the key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for
the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{type} - The type of virtual private gateway. Currently the only
supported type is \code{ipsec.1}.
\item \code{vpn-gateway-id} - The ID of the virtual private gateway.

\item{VpnGatewayIds}{One or more virtual private gateway IDs.

Default: Describes all your virtual private gateways.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
