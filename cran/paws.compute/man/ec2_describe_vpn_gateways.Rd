\arguments{
\item{Filters}{One or more filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{amazon-side-asn} - The Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the
Amazon side of the gateway.
\item \code{attachment.state} - The current state of the attachment between the

\code{detached}).
\item \code{attachment.vpc-id} - The ID of an attached VPC.
\item \code{availability-zone} - The Availability Zone for the virtual private

\item \code{tag}:\<key\> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag
with the key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for
the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{type} - The type of virtual private gateway. Currently the only
supported type is \code{ipsec.1}.
\item \code{vpn-gateway-id} - The ID of the virtual private gateway.

\item{VpnGatewayIds}{One or more virtual private gateway IDs.

Default: Describes all your virtual private gateways.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without

the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}
