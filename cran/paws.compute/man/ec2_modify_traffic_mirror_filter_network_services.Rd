\description{
Allows or restricts mirroring network services.
}
\details{
By default, Amazon DNS network services are not eligible for Traffic
Mirror. Use \code{AddNetworkServices} to add network services to a Traffic
Mirror filter. When a network service is added to the Traffic Mirror
filter, all traffic related to that network service will be mirrored.
When you no longer want to mirror network services, use
\code{RemoveNetworkServices} to remove the network services from the Traffic
Mirror filter.

For information about filter rule properties, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-considerations.html}{Network Services}
in the \emph{Traffic Mirroring User Guide} .
