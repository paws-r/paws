\title{Associates an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances
that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a network
interface}
\usage{
ec2_associate_address(
  AllocationId = NULL,
  InstanceId = NULL,
  PublicIp = NULL,
  DryRun = NULL,
  NetworkInterfaceId = NULL,
  PrivateIpAddress = NULL,
  AllowReassociation = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{AllocationId}{The allocation ID. This is required.}

\item{InstanceId}{The ID of the instance. The instance must have exactly one attached
network interface. You can specify either the instance ID or the network
interface ID, but not both.}

\item{PublicIp}{Deprecated.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{NetworkInterfaceId}{The ID of the network interface. If the instance has more than one
network interface, you must specify a network interface ID.

You can specify either the instance ID or the network interface ID, but
not both.}

\item{PrivateIpAddress}{The primary or secondary private IP address to associate with the
Elastic IP address. If no private IP address is specified, the Elastic
IP address is associated with the primary private IP address.}

\item{AllowReassociation}{Reassociation is automatic, but you can specify false to ensure the
operation fails if the Elastic IP address is already associated with
another resource.}

\description{
Associates an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a network interface. Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate it to your account.
