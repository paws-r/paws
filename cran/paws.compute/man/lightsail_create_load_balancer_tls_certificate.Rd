\usage{
lightsail_create_load_balancer_tls_certificate(loadBalancerName,
  certificateName, certificateDomainName, certificateAlternativeNames,
  tags)
}
\arguments{
\item{loadBalancerName}{[required] The load balancer name where you want to create the SSL/TLS certificate.}

\item{certificateName}{[required] The SSL/TLS certificate name.

You can have up to 10 certificates in your account at one time. Each
Lightsail load balancer can have up to 2 certificates associated with it
at one time. There is also an overall limit to the number of
certificates that can be issue in a 365-day period. For more
information, see
\href{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html}{Limits}.}

\item{certificateDomainName}{[required] The domain name (e.g., \code{example.com}) for your SSL/TLS certificate.}

\item{certificateAlternativeNames}{An array of strings listing alternative domains and subdomains for your
SSL/TLS certificate. Lightsail will de-dupe the names for you. You can
have a maximum of 9 alternative names (in addition to the 1 primary
domain). We do not support wildcards (e.g., \verb{*.example.com}).}

\item{tags}{The tag keys and optional values to add to the resource during create.

operation.}

\details{
TLS is just an updated, more secure version of Secure Socket Layer
(SSL).

The \verb{create load balancer tls certificate} operation supports tag-based
access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by
\verb{load balancer name}. For more information, see the \href{https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags}{Lightsail Dev Guide}.
