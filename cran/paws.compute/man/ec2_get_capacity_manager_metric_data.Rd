ec2_get_capacity_manager_metric_data(
  MetricNames,
  StartTime,
  EndTime,
  Period,
  GroupBy = NULL,
  FilterBy = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{MetricNames}{[required] The names of the metrics to retrieve. Maximum of 10 metrics per request.}

\item{StartTime}{[required] The start time for the metric data query, in ISO 8601 format. The time
range (end time - start time) must be a multiple of the specified
period.}

\item{EndTime}{[required] The end time for the metric data query, in ISO 8601 format. If the end
time is beyond the latest ingested data, it will be automatically
adjusted to the latest available data point.}

\item{Period}{[required] The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points.}

\item{GroupBy}{The dimensions by which to group the metric data. This determines how
the data is aggregated and returned.}

\item{FilterBy}{Conditions to filter the metric data. Each filter specifies a dimension,
comparison operator ('equals', 'in'), and values to match against.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of data points to return. Valid range is 1 to
100,000. Use with NextToken for pagination of large result sets.}

\item{NextToken}{The token for the next page of results. Use this value in a subsequent
call to retrieve additional data points.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\description{
Retrieves capacity usage metrics for your EC2 resources. Returns time-series data for metrics like unused capacity, utilization rates, and costs across On-Demand, Spot, and Capacity Reservations. Data can be grouped and filtered by various dimensions such as region, account, and instance family.
