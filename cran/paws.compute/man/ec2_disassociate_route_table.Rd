\description{
Disassociates a subnet from a route table.
}
\details{
After you perform this action, the subnet no longer uses the routes in
the route table. Instead, it uses the routes in the VPC\'s main route
table. For more information about route tables, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html}{Route Tables}
in the \emph{Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide}.
