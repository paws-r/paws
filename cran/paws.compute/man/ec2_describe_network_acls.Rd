\usage{
ec2_describe_network_acls(
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  DryRun = NULL,
  NetworkAclIds = NULL,
  Filters = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{NextToken}{The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination
continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next
page of items, make another request with the token returned in the
output. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination}{Pagination}.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{NetworkAclIds}{The IDs of the network ACLs.}

\item{Filters}{The filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{association.association-id} - The ID of an association ID for the
ACL.
\item \code{association.network-acl-id} - The ID of the network ACL involved in
the association.
\item \code{association.subnet-id} - The ID of the subnet involved in the
association.
\item \code{default} - Indicates whether the ACL is the default network ACL for
the VPC.
\item \code{entry.cidr} - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in the entry.
\item \code{entry.icmp.code} - The ICMP code specified in the entry, if any.
\item \code{entry.icmp.type} - The ICMP type specified in the entry, if any.
\item \code{entry.ipv6-cidr} - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in the entry.
\item \code{entry.port-range.from} - The start of the port range specified in
the entry.
\item \code{entry.port-range.to} - The end of the port range specified in the
entry.
\item \code{entry.protocol} - The protocol specified in the entry (\code{tcp} |
\code{udp} | \code{icmp} or a protocol number).
\item \code{entry.rule-action} - Allows or denies the matching traffic (\code{allow}
| \code{deny}).
\item \code{entry.egress} - A Boolean that indicates the type of rule. Specify
\code{true} for egress rules, or \code{false} for ingress rules.
\item \code{entry.rule-number} - The number of an entry (in other words, rule)
in the set of ACL entries.
\item \code{network-acl-id} - The ID of the network ACL.
\item \code{owner-id} - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
network ACL.
\item \code{tag} - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter
value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the
key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for the
filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{vpc-id} - The ID of the VPC for the network ACL.

\description{
Describes your network ACLs. The default is to describe all your network ACLs. Alternatively, you can specify specific network ACL IDs or filter the results to include only the network ACLs that match specific criteria.
