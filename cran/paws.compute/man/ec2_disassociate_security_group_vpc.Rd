\description{
Disassociates a security group from a VPC. You cannot disassociate the security group if any Elastic network interfaces in the associated VPC are still associated with the security group. Note that the disassociation is asynchronous and you can check the status of the request with \code{\link[=ec2_describe_security_group_vpc_associations]{describe_security_group_vpc_associations}}.
