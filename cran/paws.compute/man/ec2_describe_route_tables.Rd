\usage{
ec2_describe_route_tables(
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  DryRun = NULL,
  RouteTableIds = NULL,
  Filters = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{NextToken}{The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination
continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next
page of items, make another request with the token returned in the
output. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination}{Pagination}.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{RouteTableIds}{The IDs of the route tables.}

\item{Filters}{The filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{association.gateway-id} - The ID of the gateway involved in the
association.
\item \code{association.route-table-association-id} - The ID of an association
ID for the route table.
\item \code{association.route-table-id} - The ID of the route table involved in
the association.
\item \code{association.subnet-id} - The ID of the subnet involved in the
association.
\item \code{association.main} - Indicates whether the route table is the main
route table for the VPC (\code{true} | \code{false}). Route tables that do not
have an association ID are not returned in the response.
\item \code{owner-id} - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
route table.
\item \code{route-table-id} - The ID of the route table.
\item \code{route.destination-cidr-block} - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in a
route in the table.
\item \code{route.destination-ipv6-cidr-block} - The IPv6 CIDR range specified
in a route in the route table.
\item \code{route.destination-prefix-list-id} - The ID (prefix) of the Amazon
Web Services service specified in a route in the table.
\item \code{route.egress-only-internet-gateway-id} - The ID of an egress-only
Internet gateway specified in a route in the route table.
\item \code{route.gateway-id} - The ID of a gateway specified in a route in the
table.
\item \code{route.instance-id} - The ID of an instance specified in a route in
the table.
\item \code{route.nat-gateway-id} - The ID of a NAT gateway.
\item \code{route.transit-gateway-id} - The ID of a transit gateway.
\item \code{route.origin} - Describes how the route was created.
\code{\link[=ec2_create_route_table]{create_route_table}} indicates that the
route was automatically created when the route table was created;
\code{\link[=ec2_create_route]{create_route}} indicates that the route was
manually added to the route table;
\code{\link[=ec2_enable_vgw_route_propagation]{enable_vgw_route_propagation}}
indicates that the route was propagated by route propagation.
\item \code{route.state} - The state of a route in the route table (\code{active} |
\code{blackhole}). The blackhole state indicates that the route's target
isn't available (for example, the specified gateway isn't attached
to the VPC, the specified NAT instance has been terminated, and so
on).
\item \code{route.vpc-peering-connection-id} - The ID of a VPC peering
connection specified in a route in the table.
\item \code{tag} - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter
value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the
key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for the
filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{vpc-id} - The ID of the VPC for the route table.

Describes your route tables. The default is to describe all your route tables. Alternatively, you can specify specific route table IDs or filter the results to include only the route tables that match specific criteria.
