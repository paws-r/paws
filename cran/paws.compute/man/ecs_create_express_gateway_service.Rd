\title{Creates an Express service that simplifies deploying containerized web
applications on Amazon ECS with managed Amazon Web Services
infrastructure}
\usage{
ecs_create_express_gateway_service(
  executionRoleArn,
  infrastructureRoleArn,
  serviceName = NULL,
  cluster = NULL,
  healthCheckPath = NULL,
  primaryContainer,
  taskRoleArn = NULL,
  networkConfiguration = NULL,
  cpu = NULL,
  memory = NULL,
  scalingTarget = NULL,
  tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{executionRoleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants
the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make Amazon Web Services
API calls on your behalf. This role is required for Amazon ECS to pull
container images from Amazon ECR, send container logs to Amazon
CloudWatch Logs, and retrieve sensitive data from Amazon Web Services
Systems Manager Parameter Store or Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

The execution role must include the \code{AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy}
managed policy or equivalent permissions. For Express services, this
role is used during task startup and runtime for container management
operations.}

\item{infrastructureRoleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the infrastructure role that grants
Amazon ECS permission to create and manage Amazon Web Services resources
on your behalf for the Express service. This role is used to provision
and manage Application Load Balancers, target groups, security groups,
auto-scaling policies, and other Amazon Web Services infrastructure
components.

The infrastructure role must include permissions for Elastic Load
Balancing, Application Auto Scaling, Amazon EC2 (for security groups),
and other services required for managed infrastructure. This role is
only used during Express service creation, updates, and deletion
operations.}

\item{serviceName}{The name of the Express service. This name must be unique within the
specified cluster and can contain up to 255 letters (uppercase and
lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens. The name is used to
identify the service in the Amazon ECS console and API operations.

If you don't specify a service name, Amazon ECS generates a unique name
for the service. The service name becomes part of the service ARN and
cannot be changed after the service is created.}

\item{cluster}{The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on
which to create the Express service. If you do not specify a cluster,
the \code{default} cluster is assumed.}

\item{healthCheckPath}{The path on the container that the Application Load Balancer uses for
health checks. This should be a valid HTTP endpoint that returns a
successful response (HTTP 200) when the application is healthy.

If not specified, the default health check path is \verb{/ping}. The health
check path must start with a forward slash and can include query
parameters. Examples: \verb{/health}, \verb{/api/status}, \verb{/ping?format=json}.}

\item{primaryContainer}{[required] The primary container configuration for the Express service. This
defines the main application container that will receive traffic from
the Application Load Balancer.

The primary container must specify at minimum a container image. You can
also configure the container port (defaults to 80), logging
configuration, environment variables, secrets, and startup commands. The
container image can be from Amazon ECR, Docker Hub, or any other
container registry accessible to your execution role.}

\item{taskRoleArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that containers in this
task can assume. This role allows your application code to access other
Amazon Web Services services securely.

The task role is different from the execution role. While the execution
role is used by the Amazon ECS agent to set up the task, the task role
is used by your application code running inside the container to make
Amazon Web Services API calls. If your application doesn't need to
access Amazon Web Services services, you can omit this parameter.}

\item{networkConfiguration}{The network configuration for the Express service tasks. This specifies
the VPC subnets and security groups for the tasks.

For Express services, you can specify custom security groups and
subnets. If not provided, Amazon ECS will use the default VPC
configuration and create appropriate security groups automatically. The
network configuration determines how your service integrates with your
VPC and what network access it has.}

\item{cpu}{The number of CPU units used by the task. This parameter determines the
CPU allocation for each task in the Express service. The default value
for an Express service is 256 (.25 vCPU).}

\item{memory}{The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task. This parameter
determines the memory allocation for each task in the Express service.
The default value for an express service is 512 MiB.}

\item{scalingTarget}{The auto-scaling configuration for the Express service. This defines how
the service automatically adjusts the number of running tasks based on
demand.

You can specify the minimum and maximum number of tasks, the scaling
metric (CPU utilization, memory utilization, or request count per
target), and the target value for the metric. If not specified, the
default target value for an Express service is 60.}

\item{tags}{The metadata that you apply to the Express service to help categorize
and organize it. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You
can apply up to 50 tags to a service.}
