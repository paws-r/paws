\usage{
ecr_create_repository(
  registryId = NULL,
  repositoryName,
  tags = NULL,
  imageTagMutability = NULL,
  imageScanningConfiguration = NULL,
  encryptionConfiguration = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{registryId}{The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry to
create the repository. If you do not specify a registry, the default
registry is assumed.}

\item{repositoryName}{[required] The name to use for the repository. The repository name may be specified
on its own (such as \code{nginx-web-app}) or it can be prepended with a
namespace to group the repository into a category (such as
\code{project-a/nginx-web-app}).}

\item{tags}{The metadata that you apply to the repository to help you categorize and
organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128
characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.}

\item{imageTagMutability}{The tag mutability setting for the repository. If this parameter is
omitted, the default setting of \code{MUTABLE} will be used which will allow
image tags to be overwritten. If \code{IMMUTABLE} is specified, all image
tags within the repository will be immutable which will prevent them
from being overwritten.}

\item{imageScanningConfiguration}{The image scanning configuration for the repository. This determines
whether images are scanned for known vulnerabilities after being pushed
to the repository.}

\item{encryptionConfiguration}{The encryption configuration for the repository. This determines how the
contents of your repository are encrypted at rest.}
