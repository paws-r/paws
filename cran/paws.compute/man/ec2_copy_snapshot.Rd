ec2_copy_snapshot(
  Description = NULL,
  DestinationOutpostArn = NULL,
  DestinationRegion = NULL,
  Encrypted = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Description}{A description for the EBS snapshot.}

\item{DestinationOutpostArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost to which to copy the
snapshot. Only specify this parameter when copying a snapshot from an
Amazon Web Services Region to an Outpost. The snapshot must be in the
Region for the destination Outpost. You cannot copy a snapshot from an
Outpost to a Region, from one Outpost to another, or within the same
Outpost.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/snapshots-outposts.html#copy-snapshots}{Copy snapshots from an Amazon Web Services Region to an Outpost}
in the \emph{Amazon EBS User Guide}.}

\item{DestinationRegion}{The destination Region to use in the \code{PresignedUrl} parameter of a
snapshot copy operation. This parameter is only valid for specifying the
destination Region in a \code{PresignedUrl} parameter, where it is required.

The snapshot copy is sent to the regional endpoint that you sent the
HTTP request to (for example, \verb{ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com}). With the
CLI, this is specified using the \code{--region} parameter or the default
Region in your Amazon Web Services configuration file.}

\item{Encrypted}{To encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot if encryption by default is
not enabled, enable encryption using this parameter. Otherwise, omit
this parameter. Encrypted snapshots are encrypted, even if you omit this
parameter and encryption by default is not enabled. You cannot set this
parameter to false. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html}{Amazon EBS encryption}
in the \emph{Amazon EBS User Guide}.}

\item{KmsKeyId}{The identifier of the KMS key to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this
parameter is not specified, your KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If
\code{KmsKeyId} is specified, the encrypted state must be \code{true}.

You can specify the KMS key using any of the following:
\itemize{
\item Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
\item Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.
\item Key ARN. For example,
arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
\item Alias ARN. For example,
arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.
}

Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore,
if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can
appear to complete, but eventually fails.}

\item{PresignedUrl}{When you copy an encrypted source snapshot using the Amazon EC2 Query
API, you must supply a pre-signed URL. This parameter is optional for
unencrypted snapshots. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html}{Query requests}.

The \code{PresignedUrl} should use the snapshot source endpoint, the
\code{\link[=ec2_copy_snapshot]{copy_snapshot}} action, and include the
\code{SourceRegion}, \code{SourceSnapshotId}, and \code{DestinationRegion} parameters.
The \code{PresignedUrl} must be signed using Amazon Web Services Signature
Version 4. Because EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, the signing
algorithm for this parameter uses the same logic that is described in
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html}{Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 API Reference}. An invalid or improperly signed
\code{PresignedUrl} will cause the copy operation to fail asynchronously, and
the snapshot will move to an \code{error} state.}

\item{SourceRegion}{[required] The ID of the Region that contains the snapshot to be copied.}

\item{SourceSnapshotId}{[required] The ID of the EBS snapshot to copy.}

\item{TagSpecifications}{The tags to apply to the new snapshot.}

\item{CompletionDurationMinutes}{Specify a completion duration, in 15 minute increments, to initiate a
time-based snapshot copy. Time-based snapshot copy operations complete
within the specified duration. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/time-based-copies.html}{Time-based copies}.

If you do not specify a value, the snapshot copy operation is completed
on a best-effort basis.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\description{
Copies a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can copy a snapshot within the same Region, from one Region to another, or from a Region to an Outpost. You can't copy a snapshot from an Outpost to a Region, from one Outpost to another, or within the same Outpost.
