\arguments{
\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.

\item \code{vpc-endpoint-id} - The ID of the endpoint.
}}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single
page. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by

1,000, only 1,000 results are returned.}
