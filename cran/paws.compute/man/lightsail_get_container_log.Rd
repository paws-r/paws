\title{Returns the log events of a container of your Amazon Lightsail container
service}
\usage{
lightsail_get_container_log(serviceName, containerName, startTime,
  endTime, filterPattern, pageToken)
}
\arguments{
\item{serviceName}{[required] The name of the container service for which to get a container log.}

\item{containerName}{[required] The name of the container that is either running or previously ran on
the container service for which to return a log.}

\item{startTime}{The start of the time interval for which to get log data.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
\item Specified in the Unix time format.

For example, if you wish to use a start time of October 1, 2018, at
8 PM UTC, specify \code{1538424000} as the start time.
}

You can convert a human-friendly time to Unix time format using a
converter like \href{https://www.epochconverter.com/}{Epoch converter}.}

\item{endTime}{The end of the time interval for which to get log data.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
\item Specified in the Unix time format.

For example, if you wish to use an end time of October 1, 2018, at 9
PM UTC, specify \code{1538427600} as the end time.
}

You can convert a human-friendly time to Unix time format using a
converter like \href{https://www.epochconverter.com/}{Epoch converter}.}

\item{filterPattern}{The pattern to use to filter the returned log events to a specific term.

The following are a few examples of filter patterns that you can
specify:
\itemize{
\item To return all log events, specify a filter pattern of \code{""}.
\item To exclude log events that contain the \code{ERROR} term, and return all
other log events, specify a filter pattern of \code{"-ERROR"}.
\item To return log events that contain the \code{ERROR} term, specify a filter
pattern of \code{"ERROR"}.
\item To return log events that contain both the \code{ERROR} and \code{Exception}
terms, specify a filter pattern of \code{"ERROR Exception"}.
\item To return log events that contain the \code{ERROR} \emph{or} the \code{Exception}
term, specify a filter pattern of \code{"?ERROR ?Exception"}.
}}

\item{pageToken}{The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

To get a page token, perform an initial \code{GetContainerLog} request. If
your results are paginated, the response will return a next page token
that you can specify as the page token in a subsequent request.}

\description{
Returns the log events of a container of your Amazon Lightsail container
service.

If your container service has more than one node (i.e., a scale greater
than 1), then the log events that are returned for the specified
container are merged from all nodes on your container service.

Container logs are retained for a certain amount of time. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html}{Amazon Lightsail endpoints and quotas} in
the \emph{AWS General Reference}.
