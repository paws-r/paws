\title{Deletes the specified cluster}
\usage{
ecs_delete_cluster(cluster)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster}{[required] The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to
delete.}
}
\description{
Deletes the specified cluster. The cluster will transition to the
\code{INACTIVE} state. Clusters with an \code{INACTIVE} status may remain
discoverable in your account for a period of time. However, this
behavior is subject to change in the future, so you should not rely on
\code{INACTIVE} clusters persisting.
}
\details{
You must deregister all container instances from this cluster before you
may delete it. You can list the container instances in a cluster with
ListContainerInstances and deregister them with
DeregisterContainerInstance.
