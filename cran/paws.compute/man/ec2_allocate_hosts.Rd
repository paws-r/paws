ec2_allocate_hosts(
  InstanceFamily = NULL,
  TagSpecifications = NULL,
  HostRecovery = NULL,
  OutpostArn = NULL,

  AssetIds = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{InstanceFamily}{Specifies the instance family to be supported by the Dedicated Hosts. If
you specify an instance family, the Dedicated Hosts support multiple
instance types within that instance family.

If you want the Dedicated Hosts to support a specific instance type
only, omit this parameter and specify \strong{InstanceType} instead. You
cannot specify \strong{InstanceFamily} and \strong{InstanceType} in the same
request.}

\item{TagSpecifications}{The tags to apply to the Dedicated Host during creation.}

\item{HostRecovery}{Indicates whether to enable or disable host recovery for the Dedicated
Host. Host recovery is disabled by default. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-recovery.html}{Host recovery}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}.

Default: \code{off}}

\item{OutpostArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services Outpost on
which to allocate the Dedicated Host. If you specify \strong{OutpostArn}, you
can optionally specify \strong{AssetIds}.

If you are allocating the Dedicated Host in a Region, omit this
parameter.}

\item{HostMaintenance}{Indicates whether to enable or disable host maintenance for the
Dedicated Host. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-maintenance.html}{Host maintenance}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}.}

\item{AssetIds}{The IDs of the Outpost hardware assets on which to allocate the
Dedicated Hosts. Targeting specific hardware assets on an Outpost can
help to minimize latency between your workloads. This parameter is
supported only if you specify \strong{OutpostArn}. If you are allocating the
Dedicated Hosts in a Region, omit this parameter.
\itemize{
\item If you specify this parameter, you can omit \strong{Quantity}. In this
case, Amazon EC2 allocates a Dedicated Host on each specified
hardware asset.
\item If you specify both \strong{AssetIds} and \strong{Quantity}, then the value
for \strong{Quantity} must be equal to the number of asset IDs specified.
}}

\item{AutoPlacement}{Indicates whether the host accepts any untargeted instance launches that
match its instance type configuration, or if it only accepts Host
tenancy instance launches that specify its unique host ID. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/#dedicated-hosts-understanding}{Understanding auto-placement and affinity}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}.

Default: \code{off}}

\item{ClientToken}{Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html}{Ensuring Idempotency}.}

\item{InstanceType}{Specifies the instance type to be supported by the Dedicated Hosts. If
you specify an instance type, the Dedicated Hosts support instances of
the specified instance type only.

If you want the Dedicated Hosts to support multiple instance types in a
specific instance family, omit this parameter and specify
\strong{InstanceFamily} instead. You cannot specify \strong{InstanceType} and
\strong{InstanceFamily} in the same request.}

\item{Quantity}{The number of Dedicated Hosts to allocate to your account with these
parameters. If you are allocating the Dedicated Hosts on an Outpost, and
you specify \strong{AssetIds}, you can omit this parameter. In this case,
Amazon EC2 allocates a Dedicated Host on each specified hardware asset.
If you specify both \strong{AssetIds} and \strong{Quantity}, then the value that
you specify for \strong{Quantity} must be equal to the number of asset IDs
specified.}

\item{AvailabilityZone}{[required] The Availability Zone in which to allocate the Dedicated Host.}
}
\description{
Allocates a Dedicated Host to your account. At a minimum, specify the supported instance type or instance family, the Availability Zone in which to allocate the host, and the number of hosts to allocate.
