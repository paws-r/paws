\title{Creates an IPAM prefix list resolver target}
\usage{
ec2_create_ipam_prefix_list_resolver_target(
  DryRun = NULL,
  IpamPrefixListResolverId,
  PrefixListId,
  PrefixListRegion,
  DesiredVersion = NULL,
  TrackLatestVersion,
  TagSpecifications = NULL,
  ClientToken = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DryRun}{A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
without actually making the request and provides an error response. If
you have the required permissions, the error response is
\code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{IpamPrefixListResolverId}{[required] The ID of the IPAM prefix list resolver that will manage the
synchronization of CIDRs to the target prefix list.}

\item{PrefixListId}{[required] The ID of the managed prefix list that will be synchronized with CIDRs
selected by the IPAM prefix list resolver. This prefix list becomes an
IPAM managed prefix list.

An IPAM-managed prefix list is a customer-managed prefix list that has
been associated with an IPAM prefix list resolver target. When a prefix
list becomes IPAM managed, its CIDRs are automatically synchronized
based on the IPAM prefix list resolver's CIDR selection rules, and
direct CIDR modifications are restricted.}

\item{PrefixListRegion}{[required] The Amazon Web Services Region where the prefix list is located. This is
required when referencing a prefix list in a different Region.}

\item{DesiredVersion}{The specific version of the prefix list to target. If not specified, the
resolver will target the latest version.}

\item{TrackLatestVersion}{[required] Indicates whether the resolver target should automatically track the
latest version of the prefix list. When enabled, the target will always
synchronize with the most current version of the prefix list.

Choose this for automatic updates when you want your prefix lists to
stay current with infrastructure changes without manual intervention.}

\item{TagSpecifications}{The tags to apply to the IPAM prefix list resolver target during
creation. Tags help you organize and manage your Amazon Web Services
resources.}

\item{ClientToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html}{Ensuring idempotency}.}
