\usage{
ec2_register_image(ImageLocation, Architecture, BlockDeviceMappings,
  Description, DryRun, EnaSupport, KernelId, Name, BillingProducts,
  RamdiskId, RootDeviceName, SriovNetSupport, VirtualizationType)
}
\arguments{
\item{ImageLocation}{The full path to your AMI manifest in Amazon S3 storage. The specified
bucket must have the \code{aws-exec-read} canned access control list (ACL) to
ensure that it can be accessed by Amazon EC2. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl}{Canned ACLs}
in the \emph{Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{Architecture}{The architecture of the AMI.

Default: For Amazon EBS-backed AMIs, \code{i386}. For instance store-backed
AMIs, the architecture specified in the manifest file.}

\item{BlockDeviceMappings}{The block device mapping entries.}

\item{Description}{A description for your AMI.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{EnaSupport}{Set to \code{true} to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the AMI and any
instances that you launch from the AMI.

This option is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying this option with
a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.}

\item{KernelId}{The ID of the kernel.}

\item{Name}{[required] A name for your AMI.

Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square
brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.), slashes (/), dashes (-),
single quotes (\'), at-signs (@), or underscores(\\_)}

\item{BillingProducts}{The billing product codes. Your account must be authorized to specify
billing product codes. Otherwise, you can use the AWS Marketplace to
bill for the use of an AMI.}

\item{RamdiskId}{The ID of the RAM disk.}

\item{RootDeviceName}{The device name of the root device volume (for example, \verb{/dev/sda1}).}

\item{SriovNetSupport}{Set to \code{simple} to enable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599
Virtual Function interface for the AMI and any instances that you launch
from the AMI.

There is no way to disable \code{sriovNetSupport} at this time.

This option is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying this option with
a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.}

\item{VirtualizationType}{The type of virtualization (\code{hvm} \\| \code{paravirtual}).

Default: \code{paravirtual}}
}
\description{
Registers an AMI. When you\'re creating an AMI, this is the final step
you must complete before you can launch an instance from the AMI. For
more information about creating AMIs, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami.html}{Creating Your Own AMIs}
in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide}.
}
\details{
For Amazon EBS-backed instances, CreateImage creates and registers the
AMI in a single request, so you don\'t have to register the AMI
yourself.

You can also use \code{RegisterImage} to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux
AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot
using the block device mapping. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-launch-snapshot.html}{Launching a Linux Instance from a Backup}
in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide}.

You can\'t register an image where a secondary (non-root) snapshot has
AWS Marketplace product codes.

Windows and some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux
(RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), use the EC2 billing
product code associated with an AMI to verify the subscription status
for package updates. To create a new AMI for operating systems that
require a billing product code, do the following:
\enumerate{
\item Launch an instance from an existing AMI with that billing product
code.
\item Customize the instance.
\item Create a new AMI from the instance using CreateImage to preserve the
billing product code association.
}

If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance
that was launched from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure
that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing product code. If you
purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product code,
the Reserved Instance will not be applied to the On-Demand Instance.

If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you
make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its
registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous
image and register the new image.
