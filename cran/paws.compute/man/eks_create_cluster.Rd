eks_create_cluster(
  name,
  version = NULL,
  roleArn,
  resourcesVpcConfig,
  kubernetesNetworkConfig = NULL,
  logging = NULL,
  clientRequestToken = NULL,
  tags = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] The unique name to give to your cluster.}

\item{version}{The desired Kubernetes version for your cluster. If you don't specify a
value here, the latest version available in Amazon EKS is used.}

\item{roleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that provides permissions
for the Kubernetes control plane to make calls to Amazon Web Services
API operations on your behalf. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html}{Amazon EKS Service IAM Role}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide} .}

\item{resourcesVpcConfig}{[required] The VPC configuration that's used by the cluster control plane. Amazon
EKS VPC resources have specific requirements to work properly with
Kubernetes. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html}{Cluster VPC Considerations}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html}{Cluster Security Group Considerations}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide}. You must specify at least two subnets.
You can specify up to five security groups. However, we recommend that
you use a dedicated security group for your cluster control plane.}

\item{kubernetesNetworkConfig}{The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.}

\item{logging}{Enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your
cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs
aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html}{Amazon EKS Cluster control plane logs}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide} .

CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates
apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/}{CloudWatch Pricing}.}

\item{clientRequestToken}{Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request.}

\item{tags}{The metadata to apply to the cluster to assist with categorization and
organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You
define both.}

\item{encryptionConfig}{The encryption configuration for the cluster.}
