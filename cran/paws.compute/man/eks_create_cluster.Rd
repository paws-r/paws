\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] The unique name to give to your cluster. The name can contain only
alphanumeric characters (case-sensitive), hyphens, and underscores. It
must start with an alphanumeric character and can't be longer than 100
characters. The name must be unique within the Amazon Web Services
Region and Amazon Web Services account that you're creating the cluster
in.}

\item{version}{The desired Kubernetes version for your cluster. If you don't specify a
value here, the default version available in Amazon EKS is used.

The default version might not be the latest version available.}

\item{roleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that provides permissions
for the Kubernetes control plane to make calls to Amazon Web Services
API operations on your behalf. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-iam-role.html}{Amazon EKS Service IAM Role}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide} .}

\item{resourcesVpcConfig}{[required] The VPC configuration that's used by the cluster control plane. Amazon
EKS VPC resources have specific requirements to work properly with
Kubernetes. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-reqs.html}{Cluster VPC Considerations}
and \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html}{Cluster Security Group Considerations}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide}. You must specify at least two subnets.
You can specify up to five security groups. However, we recommend that
you use a dedicated security group for your cluster control plane.}

\item{kubernetesNetworkConfig}{The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.}

\item{logging}{Enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your
cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs
aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html}{Amazon EKS Cluster control plane logs}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide} .

CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates
apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/}{CloudWatch Pricing}.}

\item{clientRequestToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request.}

\item{tags}{Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag
consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't
propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.}

\item{encryptionConfig}{The encryption configuration for the cluster.}

\item{outpostConfig}{An object representing the configuration of your local Amazon EKS
cluster on an Amazon Web Services Outpost. Before creating a local
cluster on an Outpost, review \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-outposts-local-cluster-overview.html}{Local clusters for Amazon EKS on Amazon Web Services Outposts}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide}. This object isn't available for creating
Amazon EKS clusters on the Amazon Web Services cloud.}

\item{accessConfig}{The access configuration for the cluster.}

\item{bootstrapSelfManagedAddons}{If you set this value to \code{False} when creating a cluster, the default
networking add-ons will not be installed.

The default networking addons include vpc-cni, coredns, and kube-proxy.

Use this option when you plan to install third-party alternative add-ons
or self-manage the default networking add-ons.}

\item{upgradePolicy}{New clusters, by default, have extended support enabled. You can disable
extended support when creating a cluster by setting this value to
\code{STANDARD}.}

\item{zonalShiftConfig}{Enable or disable ARC zonal shift for the cluster. If zonal shift is
enabled, Amazon Web Services configures zonal autoshift for the cluster.

Zonal shift is a feature of Amazon Application Recovery Controller
(ARC). ARC zonal shift is designed to be a temporary measure that allows
you to move traffic for a resource away from an impaired AZ until the
zonal shift expires or you cancel it. You can extend the zonal shift if
necessary.

You can start a zonal shift for an EKS cluster, or you can allow Amazon
Web Services to do it for you by enabling \emph{zonal autoshift}. This shift
updates the flow of east-to-west network traffic in your cluster to only
consider network endpoints for Pods running on worker nodes in healthy
AZs. Additionally, any ALB or NLB handling ingress traffic for
applications in your EKS cluster will automatically route traffic to
targets in the healthy AZs. For more information about zonal shift in
EKS, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/zone-shift.html}{Learn about Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Zonal Shift in Amazon EKS}
in the \emph{Amazon EKS User Guide} .}

\item{remoteNetworkConfig}{The configuration in the cluster for EKS Hybrid Nodes. You can't change
or update this configuration after the cluster is created.}

\item{computeConfig}{Enable or disable the compute capability of EKS Auto Mode when creating
your EKS Auto Mode cluster. If the compute capability is enabled, EKS
Auto Mode will create and delete EC2 Managed Instances in your Amazon
Web Services account}

\item{storageConfig}{Enable or disable the block storage capability of EKS Auto Mode when
creating your EKS Auto Mode cluster. If the block storage capability is
enabled, EKS Auto Mode will create and delete EBS volumes in your Amazon
Web Services account.}
