\title{Retrieves the current execution state required for the replay process
during durable function execution}
\usage{
lambda_get_durable_execution_state(
  DurableExecutionArn,
  CheckpointToken,
  Marker = NULL,
  MaxItems = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DurableExecutionArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the durable execution.}

\item{CheckpointToken}{[required] A checkpoint token that identifies the current state of the execution.
This token is provided by the Lambda runtime and ensures that state
retrieval is consistent with the current execution context.}

\item{Marker}{If \code{NextMarker} was returned from a previous request, use this value to
retrieve the next page of operations. Each pagination token expires
after 24 hours.}

\item{MaxItems}{The maximum number of operations to return per call. You can use
\code{Marker} to retrieve additional pages of results. The default is 100 and
the maximum allowed is 1000. A value of 0 uses the default.}
}
\description{
Retrieves the current execution state required for the replay process during \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/durable-functions.html}{durable function} execution. This API is used by the Lambda durable functions SDK to get state information needed for replay. You typically don't need to call this API directly as the SDK handles state management automatically.
