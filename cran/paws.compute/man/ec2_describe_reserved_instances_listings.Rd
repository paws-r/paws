\description{
Describes your account\'s Reserved Instance listings in the Reserved
Instance Marketplace.
}
\details{
The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell
Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with buyers who want
to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought and sold
through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other Reserved
Instances.

As a seller, you choose to list some or all of your Reserved Instances,
and you specify the upfront price to receive for them. Your Reserved
Instances are then listed in the Reserved Instance Marketplace and are
available for purchase.

As a buyer, you specify the configuration of the Reserved Instance to
purchase, and the Marketplace matches what you\'re searching for with
what\'s available. The Marketplace first sells the lowest priced
Reserved Instances to you, and continues to sell available Reserved
Instance listings to you until your demand is met. You are charged based
on the total price of all of the listings that you purchase.
