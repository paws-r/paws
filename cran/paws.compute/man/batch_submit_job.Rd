\arguments{
\item{jobName}{[required] The name of the job. It can be up to 128 letters long. The first
character must be alphanumeric, can contain uppercase and lowercase
letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).}

\item{jobQueue}{[required] The job queue where the job is submitted. You can specify either the
name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the queue.}

\item{shareIdentifier}{The share identifier for the job. Don't specify this parameter if the
job queue doesn't have a fair-share scheduling policy. If the job queue
has a fair-share scheduling policy, then this parameter must be
specified.

This string is limited to 255 alphanumeric characters, and can be
followed by an asterisk (*).}

\item{schedulingPriorityOverride}{The scheduling priority for the job. This only affects jobs in job
queues with a fair-share policy. Jobs with a higher scheduling priority
are scheduled before jobs with a lower scheduling priority. This
overrides any scheduling priority in the job definition and works only
within a single share identifier.

The minimum supported value is 0 and the maximum supported value is
9999.}

\item{arrayProperties}{The array properties for the submitted job, such as the size of the
array. The array size can be between 2 and 10,000. If you specify array
properties for a job, it becomes an array job. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/array_jobs.html}{Array Jobs}
in the \emph{Batch User Guide}.}

\item{dependsOn}{A list of dependencies for the job. A job can depend upon a maximum of
20 jobs. You can specify a \code{SEQUENTIAL} type dependency without
specifying a job ID for array jobs so that each child array job
completes sequentially, starting at index 0. You can also specify an
\code{N_TO_N} type dependency with a job ID for array jobs. In that case,
each index child of this job must wait for the corresponding index child
of each dependency to complete before it can begin.}

\item{jobDefinition}{[required] The job definition used by this job. This value can be one of
\code{definition-name}, \code{definition-name:revision}, or the Amazon Resource
Name (ARN) for the job definition, with or without the revision
(\code{arn:aws:batch:region:account:job-definition/definition-name:revision },
or \code{arn:aws:batch:region:account:job-definition/definition-name }).

If the revision is not specified, then the latest active revision is
used.}

\item{parameters}{Additional parameters passed to the job that replace parameter
substitution placeholders that are set in the job definition. Parameters
are specified as a key and value pair mapping. Parameters in a
\code{\link[=batch_submit_job]{submit_job}} request override any corresponding
parameter defaults from the job definition.}

\item{containerOverrides}{An object with properties that override the defaults for the job
definition that specify the name of a container in the specified job
definition and the overrides it should receive. You can override the
default command for a container, which is specified in the job
definition or the Docker image, with a \code{command} override. You can also
override existing environment variables on a container or add new
environment variables to it with an \code{environment} override.}

\item{nodeOverrides}{A list of node overrides in JSON format that specify the node range to
target and the container overrides for that node range.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources; use \code{containerOverrides} instead.}

\item{retryStrategy}{The retry strategy to use for failed jobs from this
\code{\link[=batch_submit_job]{submit_job}} operation. When a retry strategy is
specified here, it overrides the retry strategy defined in the job
definition.}

\item{propagateTags}{Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition
to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags
aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task
creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over
job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job
and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the \code{FAILED} state.
When specified, this overrides the tag propagation setting in the job
definition.}

\item{timeout}{The timeout configuration for this \code{\link[=batch_submit_job]{submit_job}}
operation. You can specify a timeout duration after which Batch
terminates your jobs if they haven't finished. If a job is terminated
due to a timeout, it isn't retried. The minimum value for the timeout is
60 seconds. This configuration overrides any timeout configuration
specified in the job definition. For array jobs, child jobs have the
same timeout configuration as the parent job. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/}{Job Timeouts}
in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide}.}

\item{tags}{The tags that you apply to the job request to help you categorize and
organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
value. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html}{Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources}
in \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference}.}

\item{eksPropertiesOverride}{An object, with properties that override defaults for the job
definition, can only be specified for jobs that are run on Amazon EKS
resources.}

\item{ecsPropertiesOverride}{An object, with properties that override defaults for the job
definition, can only be specified for jobs that are run on Amazon ECS
resources.}

\item{consumableResourcePropertiesOverride}{An object that contains overrides for the consumable resources of a job.}
}
\description{
Submits an Batch job from a job definition. Parameters that are specified during \code{\link[=batch_submit_job]{submit_job}} override parameters defined in the job definition. vCPU and memory requirements that are specified in the \code{resourceRequirements} objects in the job definition are the exception. They can't be overridden this way using the \code{memory} and \code{vcpus} parameters. Rather, you must specify updates to job definition parameters in a \code{resourceRequirements} object that's included in the \code{containerOverrides} parameter.
