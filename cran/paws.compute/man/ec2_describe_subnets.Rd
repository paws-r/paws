}
\arguments{
\item{Filters}{The filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{availability-zone} - The Availability Zone for the subnet. You can
also use \code{availabilityZone} as the filter name.
\item \code{availability-zone-id} - The ID of the Availability Zone for the
subnet. You can also use \code{availabilityZoneId} as the filter name.
\item \code{available-ip-address-count} - The number of IPv4 addresses in the
subnet that are available.
\item \code{cidr-block} - The IPv4 CIDR block of the subnet. The CIDR block you
specify must exactly match the subnet's CIDR block for information
to be returned for the subnet. You can also use \code{cidr} or
\code{cidrBlock} as the filter names.
\item \code{customer-owned-ipv4-pool} - The customer-owned IPv4 address pool
associated with the subnet.
\item \verb{default-for-az} - Indicates whether this is the default subnet for
the Availability Zone (\code{true} | \code{false}). You can also use
\code{defaultForAz} as the filter name.
\item \code{enable-dns64} - Indicates whether DNS queries made to the
Amazon-provided DNS Resolver in this subnet should return synthetic
IPv6 addresses for IPv4-only destinations.
\item \code{enable-lni-at-device-index} - Indicates the device position for
local network interfaces in this subnet. For example, \code{1} indicates
local network interfaces in this subnet are the secondary network
interface (eth1).
\item \code{ipv6-cidr-block-association.ipv6-cidr-block} - An IPv6 CIDR block
associated with the subnet.
\item \code{ipv6-cidr-block-association.association-id} - An association ID for
an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the subnet.
\item \code{ipv6-cidr-block-association.state} - The state of an IPv6 CIDR
block associated with the subnet.
\item \code{ipv6-native} - Indicates whether this is an IPv6 only subnet
(\code{true} | \code{false}).
\item \code{map-customer-owned-ip-on-launch} - Indicates whether a network
interface created in this subnet (including a network interface
created by \code{\link[=ec2_run_instances]{run_instances}}) receives a
customer-owned IPv4 address.
\item \code{map-public-ip-on-launch} - Indicates whether instances launched in
this subnet receive a public IPv4 address.
\item \code{outpost-arn} - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.
\item \code{owner-id} - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
subnet.
\item \code{private-dns-name-options-on-launch.hostname-type} - The type of
hostname to assign to instances in the subnet at launch. For
IPv4-only and dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) subnets, an instance DNS
name can be based on the instance IPv4 address (ip-name) or the
instance ID (resource-name). For IPv6 only subnets, an instance DNS
name must be based on the instance ID (resource-name).
\item \code{private-dns-name-options-on-launch.enable-resource-name-dns-a-record} -
Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames
with DNS A records.
\item \code{private-dns-name-options-on-launch.enable-resource-name-dns-aaaa-record} -
Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames
with DNS AAAA records.
\item \code{state} - The state of the subnet (\code{pending} | \code{available}).
\item \code{subnet-arn} - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the subnet.
\item \code{subnet-id} - The ID of the subnet.
\item \code{tag} - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter
value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the
key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for the
filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{vpc-id} - The ID of the VPC for the subnet.
}}

\item{SubnetIds}{The IDs of the subnets.

Default: Describes all your subnets.}

\item{NextToken}{The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination
continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next
page of items, make another request with the token returned in the
output. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination}{Pagination}.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\description{
Describes your subnets. The default is to describe all your subnets. Alternatively, you can specify specific subnet IDs or filter the results to include only the subnets that match specific criteria.
