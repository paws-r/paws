\usage{
ecs_put_account_setting(name, value, principalArn = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{[required] The Amazon ECS account setting name to modify.

The following are the valid values for the account setting name.
\itemize{
\item \code{serviceLongArnFormat} - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name
(ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified
user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in
and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource
separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined
by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource.
You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as
resource tagging.
\item \code{taskLongArnFormat} - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user,
role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and
opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource
separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined
by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource.
You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as
resource tagging.
\item \code{fargateFIPSMode} - When turned on, you can run Fargate workloads in
a manner that is compliant with Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS-140). For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-fips-compliance.html}{Fargate Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS-140)}.
\item \code{containerInstanceLongArnFormat} - When modified, the Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for
a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected.
The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon
ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a
resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that
created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon
ECS features such as resource tagging.
\item \code{awsvpcTrunking} - When modified, the elastic network interface
(ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature
is changed. If \code{awsvpcTrunking} is turned on, any new container
instances that support the feature are launched have the increased
ENI limits available to them. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html}{Elastic Network Interface Trunking}
in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide}.
\item \code{containerInsights} - Container Insights with enhanced observability
provides all the Container Insights metrics, plus additional task
and container metrics. This version supports enhanced observability
for Amazon ECS clusters using the Amazon EC2 and Fargate launch
types. After you configure Container Insights with enhanced
observability on Amazon ECS, Container Insights auto-collects
detailed infrastructure telemetry from the cluster level down to the
container level in your environment and displays these critical
performance data in curated dashboards removing the heavy lifting in
observability set-up.

To use Container Insights with enhanced observability, set the
\code{containerInsights} account setting to \code{enhanced}.

To use Container Insights, set the \code{containerInsights} account
setting to \code{enabled}.

For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html}{Monitor Amazon ECS containers using Container Insights with enhanced observability}
in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide}.
\item \code{dualStackIPv6} - When turned on, when using a VPC in dual stack
mode, your tasks using the \code{awsvpc} network mode can have an IPv6
address assigned. For more information on using IPv6 with tasks
launched on Amazon EC2 instances, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-awsvpc.html#task-networking-vpc-dual-stack}{Using a VPC in dual-stack mode}.
For more information on using IPv6 with tasks launched on Fargate,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-task-networking.html#fargate-task-networking-vpc-dual-stack}{Using a VPC in dual-stack mode}.
\item \code{fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod} - When Amazon Web Services
determines that a security or infrastructure update is needed for an
Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate, the tasks need to be stopped and
new tasks launched to replace them. Use
\code{fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod} to configure the wait time to
retire a Fargate task. For information about the Fargate tasks
maintenance, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-maintenance.html}{Amazon Web Services Fargate task maintenance}
in the \emph{Amazon ECS Developer Guide}.
\item \code{tagResourceAuthorization} - Amazon ECS is introducing tagging
authorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for
actions that create the resource, such as \code{ecsCreateCluster}. If
tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services
performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have
permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit
permissions to use the \code{ecs:TagResource} action. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/supported-iam-actions-tagging.html}{Grant permission to tag resources on creation}
in the \emph{Amazon ECS Developer Guide}.
\item \code{guardDutyActivate} - The \code{guardDutyActivate} parameter is read-only
in Amazon ECS and indicates whether Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring is
enabled or disabled by your security administrator in your Amazon
ECS account. Amazon GuardDuty controls this account setting on your
behalf. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-guard-duty-integration.html}{Protecting Amazon ECS workloads with Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring}.
}}

\item{value}{[required] The account setting value for the specified principal ARN. Accepted
values are \code{enabled}, \code{disabled}, \code{enhanced}, \code{on}, and \code{off}.

When you specify \code{fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod} for the \code{name}, the
following are the valid values:
\itemize{
\item \code{0} - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and immediately
retires the affected tasks.
\item \code{7} - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and waits 7
calendar days to retire the tasks.
\item \code{14} - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and waits 14
calendar days to retire the tasks.
}}

\item{principalArn}{The ARN of the principal, which can be a user, role, or the root user.
If you specify the root user, it modifies the account setting for all
users, roles, and the root user of the account unless a user or role
explicitly overrides these settings. If this field is omitted, the
setting is changed only for the authenticated user.

You must use the root user when you set the Fargate wait time
(\code{fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod}).

Federated users assume the account setting of the root user and can't
have explicit account settings set for them.}
