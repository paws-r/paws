\title{Retrieves the execution history for a durable execution, showing all the
steps, callbacks, and events that occurred during the execution}
\usage{
lambda_get_durable_execution_history(
  DurableExecutionArn,
  IncludeExecutionData = NULL,
  MaxItems = NULL,
  Marker = NULL,
  ReverseOrder = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DurableExecutionArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the durable execution.}

\item{IncludeExecutionData}{Specifies whether to include execution data such as step results and
callback payloads in the history events. Set to \code{true} to include data,
or \code{false} to exclude it for a more compact response. The default is
\code{true}.}

\item{MaxItems}{The maximum number of history events to return per call. You can use
\code{Marker} to retrieve additional pages of results. The default is 100 and
the maximum allowed is 1000. A value of 0 uses the default.}

\item{Marker}{If \code{NextMarker} was returned from a previous request, use this value to
retrieve the next page of results. Each pagination token expires after
24 hours.}

\item{ReverseOrder}{When set to \code{true}, returns the history events in reverse chronological
order (newest first). By default, events are returned in chronological
order (oldest first).}
