\arguments{
\item{ServiceName}{[required] A name for the App Runner service. It must be unique across all the
running App Runner services in your Amazon Web Services account in the
Amazon Web Services Region.}

\item{SourceConfiguration}{[required] The source to deploy to the App Runner service. It can be a code or an
image repository.}

\item{InstanceConfiguration}{The runtime configuration of instances (scaling units) of your service.}

\item{Tags}{An optional list of metadata items that you can associate with the App
Runner service resource. A tag is a key-value pair.}

\item{EncryptionConfiguration}{An optional custom encryption key that App Runner uses to encrypt the
copy of your source repository that it maintains and your service logs.
By default, App Runner uses an Amazon Web Services managed key.}

\item{HealthCheckConfiguration}{The settings for the health check that App Runner performs to monitor
the health of the App Runner service.}

\item{AutoScalingConfigurationArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an App Runner automatic scaling
configuration resource that you want to associate with your service. If
not provided, App Runner associates the latest revision of a default
auto scaling configuration.

Specify an ARN with a name and a revision number to associate that
revision. For example:
\code{arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:autoscalingconfiguration/high-availability/3}

Specify just the name to associate the latest revision. For example:
\code{arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:autoscalingconfiguration/high-availability}}

\item{NetworkConfiguration}{Configuration settings related to network traffic of the web application
that the App Runner service runs.}

\item{ObservabilityConfiguration}{The observability configuration of your service.}
