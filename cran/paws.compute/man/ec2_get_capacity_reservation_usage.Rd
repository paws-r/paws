\item{CapacityReservationId}{[required] The ID of the Capacity Reservation.}

\item{NextToken}{The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single
page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with
the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If
\code{maxResults} is given a larger value than 500, you receive an error.

the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}
