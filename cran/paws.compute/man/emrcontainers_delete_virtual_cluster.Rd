\description{
Deletes a virtual cluster. Virtual cluster is a managed entity on Amazon EMR on EKS. You can create, describe, list and delete virtual clusters. They do not consume any additional resource in your system. A single virtual cluster maps to a single Kubernetes namespace. Given this relationship, you can model virtual clusters the same way you model Kubernetes namespaces to meet your requirements.
