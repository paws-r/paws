\arguments{
\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{ClientToken}{Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html}{How to ensure idempotency}.}

\item{DeliverLogsPermissionArn}{The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon EC2 to publish flow logs to
the log destination.

This parameter is required if the destination type is
\code{cloud-watch-logs}, or if the destination type is
\code{kinesis-data-firehose} and the delivery stream and the resources to
monitor are in different accounts.}

\item{DeliverCrossAccountRole}{The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon EC2 to publish flow logs
across accounts.}

\item{LogGroupName}{The name of a new or existing CloudWatch Logs log group where Amazon EC2
publishes your flow logs.

This parameter is valid only if the destination type is
\code{cloud-watch-logs}.}

\item{ResourceIds}{[required] The IDs of the resources to monitor. For example, if the resource type
is \code{VPC}, specify the IDs of the VPCs.

Constraints: Maximum of 25 for transit gateway resource types. Maximum
of 1000 for the other resource types.}

\item{ResourceType}{[required] The type of resource to monitor.}

\item{TrafficType}{The type of traffic to monitor (accepted traffic, rejected traffic, or
all traffic). This parameter is not supported for transit gateway
resource types. It is required for the other resource types.}

\item{LogDestinationType}{The type of destination for the flow log data.

Default: \code{cloud-watch-logs}}

\item{LogDestination}{The destination for the flow log data. The meaning of this parameter
depends on the destination type.
\itemize{
\item If the destination type is \code{cloud-watch-logs}, specify the ARN of a
CloudWatch Logs log group. For example:

arn:aws:logs:\emph{region}:\emph{account_id}:log-group:\emph{my_group}

Alternatively, use the \code{LogGroupName} parameter.
\item If the destination type is \code{s3}, specify the ARN of an S3 bucket.
For example:

arn:aws:s3:::\emph{my_bucket}/\emph{my_subfolder}/

The subfolder is optional. Note that you can't use \code{AWSLogs} as a
subfolder name.
\item If the destination type is \code{kinesis-data-firehose}, specify the ARN
of a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. For example:

arn:aws:firehose:\emph{region}:\emph{account_id}:deliverystream:\emph{my_stream}
}}

\item{LogFormat}{The fields to include in the flow log record. List the fields in the
order in which they should appear. If you omit this parameter, the flow
log is created using the default format. If you specify this parameter,
you must include at least one field. For more information about the
available fields, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html}{Flow log records}
in the \emph{Amazon VPC User Guide} or \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-flow-logs.html#flow-log-records}{Transit Gateway Flow Log records}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Transit Gateway Guide}.

Specify the fields using the \verb{$\{field-id\}} format, separated by spaces.}

\item{TagSpecifications}{The tags to apply to the flow logs.}

\item{MaxAggregationInterval}{The maximum interval of time during which a flow of packets is captured
and aggregated into a flow log record. The possible values are 60
seconds (1 minute) or 600 seconds (10 minutes). This parameter must be
60 seconds for transit gateway resource types.

When a network interface is attached to a \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-nitro-instances.html}{Nitro-based instance},
the aggregation interval is always 60 seconds or less, regardless of the
value that you specify.

Default: 600}

\item{DestinationOptions}{The destination options.}
