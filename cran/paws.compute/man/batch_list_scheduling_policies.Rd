\title{Returns a list of Batch scheduling policies}
\usage{
batch_list_scheduling_policies(maxResults = NULL, nextToken = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of results that's returned by
\code{\link[=batch_list_scheduling_policies]{list_scheduling_policies}} in
paginated output. When this parameter is used,
\code{\link[=batch_list_scheduling_policies]{list_scheduling_policies}} only
returns \code{maxResults} results in a single page and a \code{nextToken} response
element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by
sending another
\code{\link[=batch_list_scheduling_policies]{list_scheduling_policies}} request
with the returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 1 and
100. If this parameter isn't used,
\code{\link[=batch_list_scheduling_policies]{list_scheduling_policies}} returns up
to 100 results and a \code{nextToken} value if applicable.}

\item{nextToken}{The \code{nextToken} value that's returned from a previous paginated
\code{\link[=batch_list_scheduling_policies]{list_scheduling_policies}} request
where \code{maxResults} was used and the results exceeded the value of that
parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results
that returned the \code{nextToken} value. This value is \code{null} when there are
no more results to return.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to
retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
purposes.}
