\arguments{
\item{ClientToken}{Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html}{Ensure Idempotency}.}

\item{InstanceType}{[required] The instance type for which to reserve capacity. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html}{Instance types}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}.}

\item{InstancePlatform}{[required] The type of operating system for which to reserve capacity.}

\item{AvailabilityZone}{The Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.}

\item{AvailabilityZoneId}{The ID of the Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity
Reservation.}

\item{Tenancy}{Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity
Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:
\itemize{
\item \code{default} - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is
shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.
\item \code{dedicated} - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant
hardware that is dedicated to a single Amazon Web Services account.
}}

\item{InstanceCount}{[required] The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.

Valid range: 1 - 1000}

\item{EbsOptimized}{Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-optimized
instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS
and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance.
This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional
usage charges apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.}

\item{EphemeralStorage}{\emph{Deprecated.}}

\item{EndDate}{The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a
Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you
can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state
changes to \code{expired} when it reaches its end date and time.

You must provide an \code{EndDate} value if \code{EndDateType} is \code{limited}. Omit
\code{EndDate} if \code{EndDateType} is \code{unlimited}.

If the \code{EndDateType} is \code{limited}, the Capacity Reservation is cancelled
within an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify
5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end
between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.}

\item{EndDateType}{Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity
Reservation can have one of the following end types:
\itemize{
\item \code{unlimited} - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you
explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an \code{EndDate} if the
\code{EndDateType} is \code{unlimited}.
\item \code{limited} - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a
specified date and time. You must provide an \code{EndDate} value if the
\code{EndDateType} value is \code{limited}.
}}

\item{InstanceMatchCriteria}{Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation
accepts. The options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{open} - The Capacity Reservation automatically matches all
instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform,
and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run
in the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any
additional parameters.
\item \code{targeted} - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that
have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability
Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures
that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.
}

Default: \code{open}}

\item{TagSpecifications}{The tags to apply to the Capacity Reservation during launch.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{OutpostArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on which to create the
Capacity Reservation.}

\item{PlacementGroupArn}{The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster placement group in which
to create the Capacity Reservation. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/cr-cpg.html}{Capacity Reservations for cluster placement groups}
in the \emph{Amazon EC2 User Guide}.}
