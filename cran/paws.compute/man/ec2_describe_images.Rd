\arguments{
\item{ExecutableUsers}{Scopes the images by users with explicit launch permissions. Specify an
Amazon Web Services account ID, \code{self} (the sender of the request), or
\code{all} (public AMIs).
\itemize{
\item If you specify an Amazon Web Services account ID that is not your
own, only AMIs shared with that specific Amazon Web Services account
ID are returned. However, AMIs that are shared with the accountâ€™s
organization or organizational unit (OU) are not returned.
\item If you specify \code{self} or your own Amazon Web Services account ID,
AMIs shared with your account are returned. In addition, AMIs that
are shared with the organization or OU of which you are member are
also returned.
\item If you specify \code{all}, all public AMIs are returned.
}}

\item{ImageIds}{The image IDs.

Default: Describes all images available to you.}

\item{Owners}{Scopes the results to images with the specified owners. You can specify
a combination of Amazon Web Services account IDs, \code{self}, \code{amazon},
\code{aws-backup-vault}, and \code{aws-marketplace}. If you omit this parameter,
the results include all images for which you have launch permissions,
regardless of ownership.}

\item{IncludeDeprecated}{Specifies whether to include deprecated AMIs.

Default: No deprecated AMIs are included in the response.

If you are the AMI owner, all deprecated AMIs appear in the response
regardless of what you specify for this parameter.}

\item{IncludeDisabled}{Specifies whether to include disabled AMIs.

Default: No disabled AMIs are included in the response.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next
page of items, make another request with the token returned in the
output. For more information, see
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination}{Pagination}.}

\item{NextToken}{The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination
continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.}

\item{DryRun}{Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.}

\item{Filters}{The filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{architecture} - The image architecture (\code{i386} | \code{x86_64} | \code{arm64}
| \code{x86_64_mac} | \code{arm64_mac}).
\item \code{block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination} - A Boolean value that
indicates whether the Amazon EBS volume is deleted on instance
termination.
\item \code{block-device-mapping.device-name} - The device name specified in
the block device mapping (for example, \verb{/dev/sdh} or \code{xvdh}).
\item \code{block-device-mapping.snapshot-id} - The ID of the snapshot used for
the Amazon EBS volume.
\item \code{block-device-mapping.volume-size} - The volume size of the Amazon
EBS volume, in GiB.
\item \code{block-device-mapping.volume-type} - The volume type of the Amazon
EBS volume (\code{io1} | \code{io2} | \code{gp2} | \code{gp3} | \code{sc1 }| \code{st1} |
\code{standard}).
\item \code{block-device-mapping.encrypted} - A Boolean that indicates whether
the Amazon EBS volume is encrypted.
\item \code{creation-date} - The time when the image was created, in the ISO
8601 format in the UTC time zone (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ), for
example, \verb{2021-09-29T11:04:43.305Z}. You can use a wildcard (\code{*}),
for example, \verb{2021-09-29T*}, which matches an entire day.
\item \code{description} - The description of the image (provided during image
creation).
\item \code{ena-support} - A Boolean that indicates whether enhanced networking
with ENA is enabled.
\item \code{hypervisor} - The hypervisor type (\code{ovm} | \code{xen}).
\item \code{image-allowed} - A Boolean that indicates whether the image meets
the criteria specified for Allowed AMIs.
\item \code{image-id} - The ID of the image.
\item \code{image-type} - The image type (\code{machine} | \code{kernel} | \code{ramdisk}).
\item \code{is-public} - A Boolean that indicates whether the image is public.
\item \code{kernel-id} - The kernel ID.
\item \code{manifest-location} - The location of the image manifest.
\item \code{name} - The name of the AMI (provided during image creation).
\item \code{owner-alias} - The owner alias (\code{amazon} | \code{aws-backup-vault} |
\code{aws-marketplace}). The valid aliases are defined in an
Amazon-maintained list. This is not the Amazon Web Services account
alias that can be set using the IAM console. We recommend that you
use the \strong{Owner} request parameter instead of this filter.
\item \code{owner-id} - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner. We
recommend that you use the \strong{Owner} request parameter instead of
this filter.
\item \code{platform} - The platform. The only supported value is \code{windows}.
\item \code{product-code} - The product code.
\item \code{product-code.type} - The type of the product code (\code{marketplace}).
\item \code{ramdisk-id} - The RAM disk ID.
\item \code{root-device-name} - The device name of the root device volume (for
example, \verb{/dev/sda1}).
\item \code{root-device-type} - The type of the root device volume (\code{ebs} |
\code{instance-store}).
\item \code{source-image-id} - The ID of the source AMI from which the AMI was
created.
\item \code{source-image-region} - The Region of the source AMI.
\item \code{source-instance-id} - The ID of the instance that the AMI was
created from if the AMI was created using CreateImage. This filter
is applicable only if the AMI was created using
\code{\link[=ec2_create_image]{create_image}}.
\item \code{state} - The state of the image (\code{available} | \code{pending} |
\code{failed}).
\item \code{state-reason-code} - The reason code for the state change.
\item \code{state-reason-message} - The message for the state change.
\item \code{sriov-net-support} - A value of \code{simple} indicates that enhanced
networking with the Intel 82599 VF interface is enabled.
\item \verb{tag:<key>} - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag
with the key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for
the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
\item \code{virtualization-type} - The virtualization type (\code{paravirtual} |
\code{hvm}).
