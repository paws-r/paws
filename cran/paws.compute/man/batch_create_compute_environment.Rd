batch_create_compute_environment(
  computeEnvironmentName,
  type,
  state = NULL,
  unmanagedvCpus = NULL,
  computeResources = NULL,
  serviceRole = NULL,
  tags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{computeEnvironmentName}{[required] The name for your compute environment. It can be up to 128 letters long.
It can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-),
and underscores (_).}

\item{type}{[required] The type of the compute environment: \code{MANAGED} or \code{UNMANAGED}. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html}{Compute Environments}
in the \emph{Batch User Guide}.}

\item{state}{The state of the compute environment. If the state is \code{ENABLED}, then
the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out
automatically based on queues.

If the state is \code{ENABLED}, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place
jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the
environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale
its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.

If the state is \code{DISABLED}, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to
place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a \code{STARTING} or \code{RUNNING}
state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the
\code{DISABLED} state don't scale out. However, they scale in to \code{minvCpus}
value after instances become idle.}

\item{unmanagedvCpus}{The maximum number of vCPUs for an unmanaged compute environment. This
parameter is only used for fair share scheduling to reserve vCPU
capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't provided for
a fair share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved.

This parameter is only supported when the \code{type} parameter is set to
\code{UNMANAGED}.}

\item{computeResources}{Details about the compute resources managed by the compute environment.
This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html}{Compute Environments}
in the \emph{Batch User Guide}.}

\item{serviceRole}{The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to
make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html}{Batch service IAM role}
in the \emph{Batch User Guide}.

If your account already created the Batch service-linked role, that role
is used by default for your compute environment unless you specify a
different role here. If the Batch service-linked role doesn't exist in
your account, and no role is specified here, the service attempts to
create the Batch service-linked role in your account.

If your specified role has a path other than \code{/}, then you must specify
either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the
path. For example, if a role with the name \code{bar} has a path of \verb{/foo/}
then you would specify \verb{/foo/bar} as the role name. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names}{Friendly names and paths}
in the \emph{IAM User Guide}.

Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might
contain the \code{service-role} path prefix. When you only specify the name
of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the
\code{service-role} path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you
specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute
environments.}

\item{tags}{The tags that you apply to the compute environment to help you
categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and
an optional value. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html}{Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources}
in \emph{Amazon Web Services General Reference}.

These tags can be updated or removed using the
\code{\link[=batch_tag_resource]{tag_resource}} and
\code{\link[=batch_untag_resource]{untag_resource}} API operations. These tags
don't propagate to the underlying compute resources.}

\description{
Creates an Batch compute environment. You can create \code{MANAGED} or \code{UNMANAGED} compute environments. \code{MANAGED} compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. \code{UNMANAGED} compute environments can only use EC2 resources.
