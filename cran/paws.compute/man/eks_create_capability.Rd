\title{Creates a managed capability resource for an Amazon EKS cluster}
\usage{
eks_create_capability(
  capabilityName,
  clusterName,
  clientRequestToken = NULL,
  type,
  roleArn,
  configuration = NULL,
  tags = NULL,
  deletePropagationPolicy
)
}
\arguments{
\item{capabilityName}{[required] A unique name for the capability. The name must be unique within your
cluster and can contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and
underscores.}

\item{clusterName}{[required] The name of the Amazon EKS cluster where you want to create the
capability.}

\item{clientRequestToken}{A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. This token is valid for 24 hours after
creation. If you retry a request with the same client request token and
the same parameters after the original request has completed
successfully, the result of the original request is returned.}

\item{type}{[required] The type of capability to create. Valid values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{ACK} – Amazon Web Services Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK), which
lets you manage resources directly from Kubernetes.
\item \code{ARGOCD} – Argo CD for GitOps-based continuous delivery.
\item \code{KRO} – Kube Resource Orchestrator (KRO) for composing and managing
custom Kubernetes resources.
}}

\item{roleArn}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the capability uses
to interact with Amazon Web Services services. This role must have a
trust policy that allows the EKS service principal to assume it, and it
must have the necessary permissions for the capability type you're
creating.

For ACK capabilities, the role needs permissions to manage the resources
you want to control through Kubernetes. For Argo CD capabilities, the
role needs permissions to access Git repositories and Secrets Manager.
For KRO capabilities, the role needs permissions based on the resources
you'll be orchestrating.}

\item{configuration}{The configuration settings for the capability. The structure of this
object varies depending on the capability type. For Argo CD
capabilities, you can configure IAM Identity CenterIAM; Identity Center
integration, RBAC role mappings, and network access settings.}

\item{tags}{}

\item{deletePropagationPolicy}{[required] Specifies how Kubernetes resources managed by the capability should be
handled when the capability is deleted. Currently, the only supported
value is \code{RETAIN} which retains all Kubernetes resources managed by the
capability when the capability is deleted.

Because resources are retained, all Kubernetes resources created by the
capability should be deleted from the cluster before deleting the
capability itself. After the capability is deleted, these resources
become difficult to manage because the controller is no longer
available.}
