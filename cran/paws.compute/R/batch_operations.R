#' Creates an Batch compute environment
#'
#' @description
#' Creates an Batch compute environment. You can create `MANAGED` or `UNMANAGED` compute environments. `MANAGED` compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. `UNMANAGED` compute environments can only use EC2 resources.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_create_compute_environment/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_create_compute_environment/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param computeEnvironmentName &#91;required&#93; The name for your compute environment. It can be up to 128 characters
#' long. It can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens
#' (-), and underscores (_).
#' @param type &#91;required&#93; The type of the compute environment: `MANAGED` or `UNMANAGED`. For more
#' information, see [Compute
#' Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html)
#' in the *Batch User Guide*.
#' @param state The state of the compute environment. If the state is `ENABLED`, then
#' the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out
#' automatically based on queues.
#' 
#' If the state is `ENABLED`, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place
#' jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the
#' environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale
#' its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.
#' 
#' If the state is `DISABLED`, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to
#' place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a `STARTING` or `RUNNING`
#' state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the
#' `DISABLED` state don't scale out.
#' 
#' Compute environments in a `DISABLED` state may continue to incur billing
#' charges. To prevent additional charges, turn off and then delete the
#' compute environment. For more information, see
#' [State](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_JobQueueDetail.html#compute_environment_state)
#' in the *Batch User Guide*.
#' 
#' When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the `minvCpus`
#' value. However, the instance size doesn't change. For example, consider
#' a `c5.8xlarge` instance with a `minvCpus` value of `4` and a
#' `desiredvCpus` value of `36`. This instance doesn't scale down to a
#' `c5.large` instance.
#' @param unmanagedvCpus The maximum number of vCPUs for an unmanaged compute environment. This
#' parameter is only used for fair-share scheduling to reserve vCPU
#' capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't provided for
#' a fair-share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved.
#' 
#' This parameter is only supported when the `type` parameter is set to
#' `UNMANAGED`.
#' @param computeResources Details about the compute resources managed by the compute environment.
#' This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more
#' information, see [Compute
#' Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html)
#' in the *Batch User Guide*.
#' @param serviceRole The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to
#' make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For
#' more information, see [Batch service IAM
#' role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html)
#' in the *Batch User Guide*.
#' 
#' If your account already created the Batch service-linked role, that role
#' is used by default for your compute environment unless you specify a
#' different role here. If the Batch service-linked role doesn't exist in
#' your account, and no role is specified here, the service attempts to
#' create the Batch service-linked role in your account.
#' 
#' If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must specify
#' either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the
#' path. For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path of `/foo/`,
#' specify `/foo/bar` as the role name. For more information, see [Friendly
#' names and
#' paths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' 
#' Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might
#' contain the `service-role` path prefix. When you only specify the name
#' of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the
#' `service-role` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you
#' specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute
#' environments.
#' @param tags The tags that you apply to the compute environment to help you
#' categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and
#' an optional value. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web
#' Services
#' Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html)
#' in *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
#' 
#' These tags can be updated or removed using the
#' [`tag_resource`][batch_tag_resource] and
#' [`untag_resource`][batch_untag_resource] API operations. These tags
#' don't propagate to the underlying compute resources.
#' @param eksConfiguration The details for the Amazon EKS cluster that supports the compute
#' environment.
#' 
#' To create a compute environment that uses EKS resources, the caller must
#' have permissions to call `eks:DescribeCluster`.
#' @param context Reserved.

#' Creates an Batch job queue
#'
#' @description
#' Creates an Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate one or more compute environments to the queue and assign an order of preference for the compute environments.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_create_job_queue/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_create_job_queue/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param jobQueueName &#91;required&#93; The name of the job queue. It can be up to 128 letters long. It can
#' contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and
#' underscores (_).
#' @param state The state of the job queue. If the job queue state is `ENABLED`, it is
#' able to accept jobs. If the job queue state is `DISABLED`, new jobs
#' can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.
#' @param schedulingPolicyArn The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair-share scheduling policy. Job
#' queues that don't have a fair-share scheduling policy are scheduled in a
#' first-in, first-out (FIFO) model. After a job queue has a fair-share
#' scheduling policy, it can be replaced but can't be removed.
#' 
#' The format is
#' `aws:Partition:batch:Region:Account:scheduling-policy/Name `.
#' 
#' An example is
#' `aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduling-policy/MySchedulingPolicy`.
#' 
#' A job queue without a fair-share scheduling policy is scheduled as a
#' FIFO job queue and can't have a fair-share scheduling policy added. Jobs
#' queues with a fair-share scheduling policy can have a maximum of 500
#' active share identifiers. When the limit has been reached, submissions
#' of any jobs that add a new share identifier fail.
#' @param priority &#91;required&#93; The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a
#' higher integer value for the `priority` parameter) are evaluated first
#' when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is
#' determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority
#' value of `10` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a
#' priority value of `1`. All of the compute environments must be either
#' EC2 (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`); EC2 and
#' Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.
#' @param computeEnvironmentOrder The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order
#' relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to
#' determine which compute environment runs a specific job. Compute
#' environments must be in the `VALID` state before you can associate them
#' with a job queue. You can associate up to three compute environments
#' with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2
#' (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`); EC2 and
#' Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.
#' 
#' All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share
#' the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment
#' architecture types in a single job queue.
#' @param serviceEnvironmentOrder A list of service environments that this job queue can use to allocate
#' jobs. All serviceEnvironments must have the same type. A job queue can't
#' have both a serviceEnvironmentOrder and a computeEnvironmentOrder field.
#' @param jobQueueType The type of job queue. For service jobs that run on SageMaker Training,
#' this value is `SAGEMAKER_TRAINING`. For regular container jobs, this
#' value is `EKS`, `ECS`, or `ECS_FARGATE` depending on the compute
#' environment.
#' @param tags The tags that you apply to the job queue to help you categorize and
#' organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
#' value. For more information, see [Tagging your Batch
#' resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-tags.html)
#' in *Batch User Guide*.
#' @param jobStateTimeLimitActions The set of actions that Batch performs on jobs that remain at the head
#' of the job queue in the specified state longer than specified times.
#' Batch will perform each action after `maxTimeSeconds` has passed.
#' (**Note**: The minimum value for maxTimeSeconds is 600 (10 minutes) and
#' its maximum value is 86,400 (24 hours).)

#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_list_jobs/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_list_jobs/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param jobQueue The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue used to
#' list jobs.
#' @param arrayJobId The job ID for an array job. Specifying an array job ID with this
#' parameter lists all child jobs from within the specified array.
#' @param multiNodeJobId The job ID for a multi-node parallel job. Specifying a multi-node
#' parallel job ID with this parameter lists all nodes that are associated
#' with the specified job.
#' @param jobStatus The job status used to filter jobs in the specified queue. If the
#' `filters` parameter is specified, the `jobStatus` parameter is ignored
#' and jobs with any status are returned. If you don't specify a status,
#' only `RUNNING` jobs are returned.
#' @param maxResults The maximum number of results returned by [`list_jobs`][batch_list_jobs]
#' in a paginated output. When this parameter is used,
#' [`list_jobs`][batch_list_jobs] returns up to `maxResults` results in a
#' single page and a `nextToken` response element, if applicable. The
#' remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another
#' [`list_jobs`][batch_list_jobs] request with the returned `nextToken`
#' value.
#' 
#' The following outlines key parameters and limitations:
#' 
#' -   The minimum value is 1.
#' 
#' -   When `--job-status` is used, Batch returns up to 1000 values.
#' 
#' -   When `--filters` is used, Batch returns up to 100 values.
#' 
#' -   If neither parameter is used, then [`list_jobs`][batch_list_jobs]
#'     returns up to 1000 results (jobs that are in the `RUNNING` status)
#'     and a `nextToken` value, if applicable.
#' @param nextToken The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated
#' [`list_jobs`][batch_list_jobs] request where `maxResults` was used and
#' the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues
#' from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken`
#' value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.
#' 
#' Treat this token as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve
#' the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
#' @param filters The filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used at a time.
#' When the filter is used, `jobStatus` is ignored. The filter doesn't
#' apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. The
#' results are sorted by the `createdAt` field, with the most recent jobs
#' being first.
#' 
#' **JOB_NAME**
#' 
#' The value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If
#' the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job name
#' that begins with the string before the '*'. This corresponds to the
#' `jobName` value. For example, `test1` matches both `Test1` and `test1`,
#' and `test1*` matches both `test1` and `Test10`. When the `JOB_NAME`
#' filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version.
#' 
#' **JOB_DEFINITION**
#' 
#' The value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
#' the job definition. This corresponds to the `jobDefinition` value. The
#' value is case sensitive. When the value for the filter is the job
#' definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any revision
#' of that job definition name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*),
#' the filter matches any job definition name that begins with the string
#' before the '*'. For example, `jd1` matches only `jd1`, and `jd1*`
#' matches both `jd1` and `jd1A`. The version of the job definition that's
#' used doesn't affect the sort order. When the `JOB_DEFINITION` filter is
#' used and the ARN is used (which is in the form
#' `arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDefinitionName}:${Revision}`),
#' the results include jobs that used the specified revision of the job
#' definition. Asterisk (*) isn't supported when the ARN is used.
#' 
#' **BEFORE_CREATED_AT**
#' 
#' The value for the filter is the time that's before the job was created.
#' This corresponds to the `createdAt` value. The value is a string
#' representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC
#' (midnight) on January 1, 1970.
#' 
#' **AFTER_CREATED_AT**
#' 
#' The value for the filter is the time that's after the job was created.
#' This corresponds to the `createdAt` value. The value is a string
#' representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC
#' (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

#'
#' @param jobDefinitionName &#91;required&#93; The name of the job definition to register. It can be up to 128 letters
#' long. It can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens
#' (-), and underscores (_).
#' @param type &#91;required&#93; The type of job definition. For more information about multi-node
#' parallel jobs, see [Creating a multi-node parallel job
#' definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/) in the
#' *Batch User Guide*.
#' 
#' -   If the value is `container`, then one of the following is required:
#'     `containerProperties`, `ecsProperties`, or `eksProperties`.
#' 
#' -   If the value is `multinode`, then `nodeProperties` is required.
#' 
#' If the job is run on Fargate resources, then `multinode` isn't
#' supported.
#' @param parameters Default parameter substitution placeholders to set in the job
#' definition. Parameters are specified as a key-value pair mapping.
#' Parameters in a [`submit_job`][batch_submit_job] request override any
#' corresponding parameter defaults from the job definition.
#' @param schedulingPriority The scheduling priority for jobs that are submitted with this job
#' definition. This only affects jobs in job queues with a fair-share
#' policy. Jobs with a higher scheduling priority are scheduled before jobs
#' with a lower scheduling priority.
#' 
#' The minimum supported value is 0 and the maximum supported value is
#' 9999.
#' @param containerProperties An object with properties specific to Amazon ECS-based single-node
#' container-based jobs. If the job definition's `type` parameter is
#' `container`, then you must specify either `containerProperties` or
#' `nodeProperties`. This must not be specified for Amazon EKS-based job
#' definitions.
#' 
#' If the job runs on Fargate resources, then you must not specify
#' `nodeProperties`; use only `containerProperties`.
#' @param nodeProperties An object with properties specific to multi-node parallel jobs. If you
#' specify node properties for a job, it becomes a multi-node parallel job.
#' For more information, see [Multi-node Parallel
#' Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/multi-node-parallel-jobs.html)

#' `nodeProperties`; use `containerProperties` instead.
#' 
#' If the job runs on Amazon EKS resources, then you must not specify
#' `nodeProperties`.
#' @param retryStrategy The retry strategy to use for failed jobs that are submitted with this
#' job definition. Any retry strategy that's specified during a
#' [`submit_job`][batch_submit_job] operation overrides the retry strategy
#' defined here. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn't retried.
#' @param propagateTags Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition
#' to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags
#' are not propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task
#' creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over

#' and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the `FAILED` state.
#' 
#' If the job runs on Amazon EKS resources, then you must not specify
#' `propagateTags`.
#' @param timeout The timeout configuration for jobs that are submitted with this job
#' definition, after which Batch terminates your jobs if they have not
#' finished. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn't retried. The
#' minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds. Any timeout configuration

#' value. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services
#' Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-tags.html)
#' in *Batch User Guide*.
#' @param platformCapabilities The platform capabilities required by the job definition. If no value is
#' specified, it defaults to `EC2`. To run the job on Fargate resources,
#' specify `FARGATE`.

#' Submits an Batch job from a job definition
#'
#' @description
#' Submits an Batch job from a job definition. Parameters that are specified during [`submit_job`][batch_submit_job] override parameters defined in the job definition. vCPU and memory requirements that are specified in the `resourceRequirements` objects in the job definition are the exception. They can't be overridden this way using the `memory` and `vcpus` parameters. Rather, you must specify updates to job definition parameters in a `resourceRequirements` object that's included in the `containerOverrides` parameter.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_submit_job/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_submit_job/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param jobName &#91;required&#93; The name of the job. It can be up to 128 letters long. The first
#' character must be alphanumeric, can contain uppercase and lowercase
#' letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
#' @param jobQueue &#91;required&#93; The job queue where the job is submitted. You can specify either the
#' name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the queue.
#' @param shareIdentifier The share identifier for the job. Don't specify this parameter if the
#' job queue doesn't have a fair-share scheduling policy. If the job queue
#' has a fair-share scheduling policy, then this parameter must be
#' specified.
#' 
#' This string is limited to 255 alphanumeric characters, and can be
#' followed by an asterisk (*).
#' @param schedulingPriorityOverride The scheduling priority for the job. This only affects jobs in job
#' queues with a fair-share policy. Jobs with a higher scheduling priority
#' are scheduled before jobs with a lower scheduling priority. This
#' overrides any scheduling priority in the job definition and works only
#' within a single share identifier.
#' 
#' The minimum supported value is 0 and the maximum supported value is
#' 9999.
#' @param arrayProperties The array properties for the submitted job, such as the size of the
#' array. The array size can be between 2 and 10,000. If you specify array
#' properties for a job, it becomes an array job. For more information, see
#' [Array
#' Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/array_jobs.html)
#' in the *Batch User Guide*.
#' @param dependsOn A list of dependencies for the job. A job can depend upon a maximum of
#' 20 jobs. You can specify a `SEQUENTIAL` type dependency without
#' specifying a job ID for array jobs so that each child array job
#' completes sequentially, starting at index 0. You can also specify an
#' `N_TO_N` type dependency with a job ID for array jobs. In that case,
#' each index child of this job must wait for the corresponding index child
#' of each dependency to complete before it can begin.
#' @param jobDefinition &#91;required&#93; The job definition used by this job. This value can be one of
#' `definition-name`, `definition-name:revision`, or the Amazon Resource
#' Name (ARN) for the job definition, with or without the revision
#' (`arn:aws:batch:region:account:job-definition/definition-name:revision `,
#' or `arn:aws:batch:region:account:job-definition/definition-name `).
#' 
#' If the revision is not specified, then the latest active revision is
#' used.
#' @param parameters Additional parameters passed to the job that replace parameter
#' substitution placeholders that are set in the job definition. Parameters
#' are specified as a key and value pair mapping. Parameters in a
#' [`submit_job`][batch_submit_job] request override any corresponding
#' parameter defaults from the job definition.
#' @param containerOverrides An object with properties that override the defaults for the job
#' definition that specify the name of a container in the specified job
#' definition and the overrides it should receive. You can override the
#' default command for a container, which is specified in the job
#' definition or the Docker image, with a `command` override. You can also
#' override existing environment variables on a container or add new
#' environment variables to it with an `environment` override.
#' @param nodeOverrides A list of node overrides in JSON format that specify the node range to
#' target and the container overrides for that node range.
#' 
#' This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
#' resources; use `containerOverrides` instead.
#' @param retryStrategy The retry strategy to use for failed jobs from this
#' [`submit_job`][batch_submit_job] operation. When a retry strategy is
#' specified here, it overrides the retry strategy defined in the job
#' definition.
#' @param propagateTags Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition
#' to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags
#' aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task
#' creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over
#' job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job
#' and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the `FAILED` state.
#' When specified, this overrides the tag propagation setting in the job
#' definition.
#' @param timeout The timeout configuration for this [`submit_job`][batch_submit_job]
#' operation. You can specify a timeout duration after which Batch
#' terminates your jobs if they haven't finished. If a job is terminated
#' due to a timeout, it isn't retried. The minimum value for the timeout is
#' 60 seconds. This configuration overrides any timeout configuration
#' specified in the job definition. For array jobs, child jobs have the
#' same timeout configuration as the parent job. For more information, see

#' Updates an Batch compute environment

#' @description
#' Updates an Batch compute environment.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_update_compute_environment/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/batch_update_compute_environment/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param computeEnvironment &#91;required&#93; The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment
#' to update.
#' @param state The state of the compute environment. Compute environments in the
#' `ENABLED` state can accept jobs from a queue and scale in or out
#' automatically based on the workload demand of its associated queues.
#' 
#' If the state is `ENABLED`, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place
#' jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the
#' environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale
#' its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.
#' 
#' If the state is `DISABLED`, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to
#' place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a `STARTING` or `RUNNING`
#' state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the
#' `DISABLED` state don't scale out.
#' 
#' Compute environments in a `DISABLED` state may continue to incur billing
#' charges. To prevent additional charges, turn off and then delete the
#' compute environment. For more information, see
#' [State](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_JobQueueDetail.html#compute_environment_state)
#' in the *Batch User Guide*.
#' 
#' When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the `minvCpus`
#' value. However, the instance size doesn't change. For example, consider
#' a `c5.8xlarge` instance with a `minvCpus` value of `4` and a
#' `desiredvCpus` value of `36`. This instance doesn't scale down to a
#' `c5.large` instance.
#' @param unmanagedvCpus The maximum number of vCPUs expected to be used for an unmanaged compute
#' environment. Don't specify this parameter for a managed compute
#' environment. This parameter is only used for fair-share scheduling to
#' reserve vCPU capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't
#' provided for a fair-share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved.
#' @param computeResources Details of the compute resources managed by the compute environment.
#' Required for a managed compute environment. For more information, see
#' [Compute
#' Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html)
#' in the *Batch User Guide*.
#' @param serviceRole The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to
#' make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For
#' more information, see [Batch service IAM
#' role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html)
#' in the *Batch User Guide*.
#' 
#' If the compute environment has a service-linked role, it can't be
#' changed to use a regular IAM role. Likewise, if the compute environment
#' has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use a service-linked
#' role. To update the parameters for the compute environment that require
#' an infrastructure update to change, the **AWSServiceRoleForBatch**
#' service-linked role must be used. For more information, see [Updating
#' compute
#' environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
#' in the *Batch User Guide*.
#' 
#' If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must either
#' specify the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the
#' path.
#' 
#' Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might
#' contain the `service-role` path prefix. When you only specify the name
#' of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the
#' `service-role` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you
#' specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute
#' environments.
#' @param updatePolicy Specifies the updated infrastructure update policy for the compute
#' environment. For more information about infrastructure updates, see
#' [Updating compute
#' environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)

#'
#' @param jobQueue &#91;required&#93; The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.
#' @param state Describes the queue's ability to accept new jobs. If the job queue state
#' is `ENABLED`, it can accept jobs. If the job queue state is `DISABLED`,
#' new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can
#' finish.
#' @param schedulingPolicyArn Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair-share scheduling policy. Once a
#' job queue is created, the fair-share scheduling policy can be replaced
#' but not removed. The format is
#' `aws:Partition:batch:Region:Account:scheduling-policy/Name `. For
#' example,
#' `aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduling-policy/MySchedulingPolicy`.
#' @param priority The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a
#' higher integer value for the `priority` parameter) are evaluated first
#' when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is
#' determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority
#' value of `10` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a
#' priority value of `1`. All of the compute environments must be either
#' EC2 (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`). EC2 and
#' Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.
#' @param computeEnvironmentOrder Details the set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their
#' order relative to each other. This is one of the parameters used by the
#' job scheduler to determine which compute environment runs a given job.
#' Compute environments must be in the `VALID` state before you can
#' associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be
#' either EC2 (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`).
#' EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.
#' 
#' All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share
#' the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment
