#' Creates a capacity provider
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a capacity provider. Capacity providers are associated with a cluster and are used in capacity provider strategies to facilitate cluster auto scaling. You can create capacity providers for Amazon ECS Managed Instances and EC2 instances. Fargate has the predefined `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_capacity_provider/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_capacity_provider/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param name &#91;required&#93; The name of the capacity provider. Up to 255 characters are allowed.
#' They include letters (both upper and lowercase letters), numbers,
#' underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The name can't be prefixed with
#' "`aws`", "`ecs`", or "`fargate`".
#' @param cluster The name of the cluster to associate with the capacity provider. When
#' you create a capacity provider with Amazon ECS Managed Instances, it
#' becomes available only within the specified cluster.
#' @param autoScalingGroupProvider The details of the Auto Scaling group for the capacity provider.
#' @param managedInstancesProvider The configuration for the Amazon ECS Managed Instances provider. This
#' configuration specifies how Amazon ECS manages Amazon EC2 instances on
#' your behalf, including the infrastructure role, instance launch
#' template, and tag propagation settings.
#' @param tags The metadata that you apply to the capacity provider to categorize and
#' organize them more conveniently. Each tag consists of a key and an
#' optional value. You define both of them.
#' 
#' The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
#' 
#' -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
#' 
#' -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
#'     have only one value.
#' 
#' -   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
#' 
#' -   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
#' 
#' -   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
#'     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
#'     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
#'     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
#'     characters: + - = . _ : / @@.
#' 
#' -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
#' 
#' -   Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of
#'     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
#'     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
#'     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
#'     your tags per resource limit.

#' Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a `default` cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_cluster/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_cluster/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param clusterName The name of your cluster. If you don't specify a name for your cluster,
#' you create a cluster that's named `default`. Up to 255 letters
#' (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are
#' allowed.
#' @param tags The metadata that you apply to the cluster to help you categorize and
#' organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You
#' define both.
#' 
#' The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
#' 
#' -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
#' 
#' -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
#'     have only one value.
#' 
#' -   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
#' 
#' -   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
#' 
#' -   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
#'     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
#'     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
#'     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
#'     characters: + - = . _ : / @@.
#' 
#' -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
#' 
#' -   Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of
#'     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
#'     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
#'     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
#'     your tags per resource limit.
#' @param settings The setting to use when creating a cluster. This parameter is used to
#' turn on CloudWatch Container Insights for a cluster. If this value is
#' specified, it overrides the `containerInsights` value set with
#' [`put_account_setting`][ecs_put_account_setting] or
#' [`put_account_setting_default`][ecs_put_account_setting_default].
#' @param configuration The `execute` command configuration for the cluster.
#' @param capacityProviders The short name of one or more capacity providers to associate with the
#' cluster. A capacity provider must be associated with a cluster before it
#' can be included as part of the default capacity provider strategy of the
#' cluster or used in a capacity provider strategy when calling the
#' [`create_service`][ecs_create_service] or [`run_task`][ecs_run_task]
#' actions.
#' 
#' If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the
#' capacity provider must be created but not associated with another
#' cluster. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with
#' the [`create_capacity_provider`][ecs_create_capacity_provider] API
#' operation.
#' 
#' To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the `FARGATE` or
#' `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are
#' available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster
#' to be used.
#' 
#' The
#' [PutCapacityProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/)
#' API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers
#' for a cluster after the cluster is created.
#' @param defaultCapacityProviderStrategy The capacity provider strategy to set as the default for the cluster.
#' After a default capacity provider strategy is set for a cluster, when
#' you call the [`create_service`][ecs_create_service] or
#' [`run_task`][ecs_run_task] APIs with no capacity provider strategy or
#' launch type specified, the default capacity provider strategy for the
#' cluster is used.
#' 
#' If a default capacity provider strategy isn't defined for a cluster when
#' it was created, it can be defined later with the
#' [`put_cluster_capacity_providers`][ecs_put_cluster_capacity_providers]
#' API operation.
#' @param serviceConnectDefaults Use this parameter to set a default Service Connect namespace. After you
#' set a default Service Connect namespace, any new services with Service
#' Connect turned on that are created in the cluster are added as client
#' services in the namespace. This setting only applies to new services
#' that set the `enabled` parameter to `true` in the
#' `ServiceConnectConfiguration`. You can set the namespace of each service
#' individually in the `ServiceConnectConfiguration` to override this
#' default parameter.
#' 
#' Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services
#' in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the
#' clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
#' container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only
#' the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service
#' Connect. For more information, see [Service
#' Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)

#'
#' @description
#' Creates an Express service that simplifies deploying containerized web applications on Amazon ECS with managed Amazon Web Services infrastructure. This operation provisions and configures Application Load Balancers, target groups, security groups, and auto-scaling policies automatically.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_express_gateway_service/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_express_gateway_service/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param executionRoleArn &#91;required&#93; The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants
#' the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make Amazon Web Services
#' API calls on your behalf. This role is required for Amazon ECS to pull
#' container images from Amazon ECR, send container logs to Amazon
#' CloudWatch Logs, and retrieve sensitive data from Amazon Web Services
#' Systems Manager Parameter Store or Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.
#' 
#' The execution role must include the `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`
#' managed policy or equivalent permissions. For Express services, this
#' role is used during task startup and runtime for container management
#' operations.
#' @param infrastructureRoleArn &#91;required&#93; The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the infrastructure role that grants
#' Amazon ECS permission to create and manage Amazon Web Services resources
#' on your behalf for the Express service. This role is used to provision
#' and manage Application Load Balancers, target groups, security groups,
#' auto-scaling policies, and other Amazon Web Services infrastructure
#' components.
#' 
#' The infrastructure role must include permissions for Elastic Load
#' Balancing, Application Auto Scaling, Amazon EC2 (for security groups),
#' and other services required for managed infrastructure. This role is
#' only used during Express service creation, updates, and deletion
#' operations.
#' @param serviceName The name of the Express service. This name must be unique within the
#' specified cluster and can contain up to 255 letters (uppercase and
#' lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens. The name is used to
#' identify the service in the Amazon ECS console and API operations.
#' 
#' If you don't specify a service name, Amazon ECS generates a unique name
#' for the service. The service name becomes part of the service ARN and
#' cannot be changed after the service is created.
#' @param cluster The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on
#' which to create the Express service. If you do not specify a cluster,
#' the `default` cluster is assumed.
#' @param healthCheckPath The path on the container that the Application Load Balancer uses for
#' health checks. This should be a valid HTTP endpoint that returns a
#' successful response (HTTP 200) when the application is healthy.
#' 
#' If not specified, the default health check path is `/ping`. The health
#' check path must start with a forward slash and can include query
#' parameters. Examples: `/health`, `/api/status`, `/ping?format=json`.
#' @param primaryContainer &#91;required&#93; The primary container configuration for the Express service. This
#' defines the main application container that will receive traffic from
#' the Application Load Balancer.
#' 
#' The primary container must specify at minimum a container image. You can
#' also configure the container port (defaults to 80), logging
#' configuration, environment variables, secrets, and startup commands. The
#' container image can be from Amazon ECR, Docker Hub, or any other
#' container registry accessible to your execution role.
#' @param taskRoleArn The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that containers in this
#' task can assume. This role allows your application code to access other
#' Amazon Web Services services securely.
#' 
#' The task role is different from the execution role. While the execution
#' role is used by the Amazon ECS agent to set up the task, the task role
#' is used by your application code running inside the container to make
#' Amazon Web Services API calls. If your application doesn't need to
#' access Amazon Web Services services, you can omit this parameter.
#' @param networkConfiguration The network configuration for the Express service tasks. This specifies
#' the VPC subnets and security groups for the tasks.
#' 
#' For Express services, you can specify custom security groups and
#' subnets. If not provided, Amazon ECS will use the default VPC
#' configuration and create appropriate security groups automatically. The
#' network configuration determines how your service integrates with your
#' VPC and what network access it has.
#' @param cpu The number of CPU units used by the task. This parameter determines the
#' CPU allocation for each task in the Express service. The default value
#' for an Express service is 256 (.25 vCPU).
#' @param memory The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task. This parameter
#' determines the memory allocation for each task in the Express service.
#' The default value for an express service is 512 MiB.
#' @param scalingTarget The auto-scaling configuration for the Express service. This defines how
#' the service automatically adjusts the number of running tasks based on
#' demand.
#' 
#' You can specify the minimum and maximum number of tasks, the scaling
#' metric (CPU utilization, memory utilization, or request count per
#' target), and the target value for the metric. If not specified, the
#' default target value for an Express service is 60.
#' @param tags The metadata that you apply to the Express service to help categorize
#' and organize it. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You
#' can apply up to 50 tags to a service.

#' Runs and maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task
#' definition
#'
#' @description
#' Runs and maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the `desiredCount`, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, use [`update_service`][ecs_update_service].
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_service/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_service/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param cluster The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that
#' you run your service on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default
#' cluster is assumed.
#' @param serviceName &#91;required&#93; The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase),
#' numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service names must be
#' unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in
#' multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions.
#' @param taskDefinition The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task
#' definition to run in your service. If a `revision` isn't specified, the
#' latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.
#' 
#' A task definition must be specified if the service uses either the `ECS`
#' or `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controllers.
#' 
#' For more information about deployment types, see [Amazon ECS deployment
#' types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/).
#' @param availabilityZoneRebalancing Indicates whether to use Availability Zone rebalancing for the service.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Balancing an Amazon ECS service across
#' Availability
#' Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-rebalancing.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .
#' 
#' The default behavior of `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` differs between
#' create and update requests:
#' 
#' -   For create service requests, when no value is specified for
#'     `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults the value to
#'     `ENABLED`.
#' 
#' -   For update service requests, when no value is specified for
#'     `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults to the existing
#'     service’s `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value. If the service never
#'     had an `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value set, Amazon ECS treats
#'     this as `DISABLED`.
#' @param loadBalancers A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your
#' service. For more information, see [Service load
#' balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' If the service uses the `ECS` deployment controller and using either an
#' Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you must specify one
#' or more target group ARNs to attach to the service. The service-linked
#' role is required for services that use multiple target groups. For more
#' information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon
#' ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' If the service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, the service
#' is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load
#' Balancer. When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two
#' target groups (referred to as a `targetGroupPair`). During a deployment,
#' CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status
#' `PRIMARY`, and it associates one target group with it. Then, it also
#' associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The
#' load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for
#' production traffic and an optional listener that you can use to perform
#' validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic
#' to it.
#' 
#' If you use the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, these values can be
#' changed when updating the service.
#' 
#' For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object
#' must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name, and
#' the container port to access from the load balancer. The container name
#' must be as it appears in a container definition. The load balancer name
#' parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a
#' container instance, the container instance and port combination is
#' registered as a target in the target group that's specified here.
#' 
#' For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer
#' name, the container name , and the container port to access from the
#' load balancer. The container name must be as it appears in a container
#' definition. The target group ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task
#' from this service is placed on a container instance, the container
#' instance is registered with the load balancer that's specified here.
#' 
#' Services with tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode (for example,
#' those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load
#' Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers aren't
#' supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services,
#' you must choose `ip` as the target type, not `instance`. This is because
#' tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode are associated with an elastic
#' network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.
#' @param serviceRegistries The details of the service discovery registry to associate with this
#' service. For more information, see [Service
#' discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html).
#' 
#' Each service may be associated with one service registry. Multiple
#' service registries for each service isn't supported.
#' @param desiredCount The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place
#' and keep running in your service.
#' 
#' This is required if `schedulingStrategy` is `REPLICA` or isn't
#' specified. If `schedulingStrategy` is `DAEMON` then this isn't required.
#' @param clientToken An identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request.
#' It must be unique and is case sensitive. Up to 36 ASCII characters in
#' the range of 33-126 (inclusive) are allowed.
#' @param launchType The infrastructure that you run your service on. For more information,
#' see [Amazon ECS launch
#' types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-configuration.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the
#' `capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the `launchType`
#' request parameter.
#' 
#' The `FARGATE` launch type runs your tasks on Fargate On-Demand
#' infrastructure.
#' 
#' Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity provider
#' strategy must be used. For more information, see [Fargate capacity
#' providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-capacity-providers.html)
#' in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' The `EC2` launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered
#' to your cluster.
#' 
#' The `EXTERNAL` launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises server or
#' virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.
#' 
#' A service can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy.
#' If a `launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy` parameter
#' must be omitted.
#' @param capacityProviderStrategy The capacity provider strategy to use for the service.
#' 
#' If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the
#' `capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the `launchType`
#' request parameter.
#' 
#' If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType` parameter
#' must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or `launchType` is
#' specified, the `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is
#' used.
#' 
#' A capacity provider strategy can contain a maximum of 20 capacity
#' providers.
#' @param platformVersion The platform version that your tasks in the service are running on. A
#' platform version is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch
#' type. If one isn't specified, the `LATEST` platform version is used. For
#' more information, see [Fargate platform
#' versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform-fargate.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param role The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows
#' Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This
#' parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your
#' service and your task definition doesn't use the `awsvpc` network mode.
#' If you specify the `role` parameter, you must also specify a load
#' balancer object with the `loadBalancers` parameter.
#' 
#' If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role,
#' that role is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The
#' service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the
#' `awsvpc` network mode or if the service is configured to use service
#' discovery, an external deployment controller, multiple target groups, or
#' Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you don't specify a role
#' here. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon
#' ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must either
#' specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name
#' with the path. For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path of
#' `/foo/` then you would specify `/foo/bar` as the role name. For more
#' information, see [Friendly names and
#' paths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names)
#' in the *IAM User Guide*.
#' @param deploymentConfiguration Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during
#' the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
#' @param placementConstraints An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your
#' service. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This
#' limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at
#' runtime.
#' @param placementStrategy The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can
#' specify a maximum of 5 strategy rules for each service.
#' @param networkConfiguration The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required
#' for task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their
#' own elastic network interface, and it isn't supported for other network
#' modes. For more information, see [Task
#' networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler
#' ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing, VPC Lattice, and container
#' health checks after a task has first started. If you do not specify a
#' health check grace period value, the default value of 0 is used. If you
#' do not use any of the health checks, then
#' `healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` is unused.
#' 
#' If your service has more running tasks than desired, unhealthy tasks in
#' the grace period might be stopped to reach the desired count.
#' @param schedulingStrategy The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information,
#' see
#' [Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).
#' 
#' There are two service scheduler strategies available:
#' 
#' -   `REPLICA`-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
#'     desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
#'     scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
#'     placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
#'     decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service uses
#'     the `CODE_DEPLOY` or `EXTERNAL` deployment controller types.
#' 
#' -   `DAEMON`-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
#'     each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
#'     constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler
#'     also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and
#'     will stop tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When
#'     you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired
#'     number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto
#'     Scaling policies.
#' 
#'     Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the `CODE_DEPLOY` or
#'     `EXTERNAL` deployment controller types don't support the `DAEMON`
#'     scheduling strategy.
#' @param deploymentController The deployment controller to use for the service. If no deployment
#' controller is specified, the default value of `ECS` is used.
#' @param tags The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and
#' organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
#' which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as
#' well.
#' 
#' The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
#' 
#' -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
#' 
#' -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
#'     have only one value.
#' 
#' -   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
#' 
#' -   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
#' 
#' -   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
#'     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
#'     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
#'     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
#'     characters: + - = . _ : / @@.
#' 
#' -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
#' 
#' -   Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of
#'     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
#'     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
#'     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
#'     your tags per resource limit.
#' @param enableECSManagedTags Specifies whether to turn on Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks
#' within the service. For more information, see [Tagging your Amazon ECS
#' resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-using-tags.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' When you use Amazon ECS managed tags, you must set the `propagateTags`
#' request parameter.
#' @param propagateTags Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the
#' task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can
#' only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a
#' task after task creation, use the [`tag_resource`][ecs_tag_resource] API
#' action.
#' 
#' You must set this to a value other than `NONE` when you use Cost
#' Explorer. For more information, see [Amazon ECS usage
#' reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/usage-reports.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' The default is `NONE`.
#' @param enableExecuteCommand Determines whether the execute command functionality is turned on for
#' the service. If `true`, this enables execute command functionality on
#' all containers in the service tasks.
#' @param serviceConnectConfiguration The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services,
#' and be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a
#' namespace.
#' 
#' Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services
#' in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the
#' clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
#' container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only
#' the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service
#' Connect. For more information, see [Service
#' Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param volumeConfigurations The configuration for a volume specified in the task definition as a
#' volume that is configured at launch time. Currently, the only supported
#' volume type is an Amazon EBS volume.
#' @param vpcLatticeConfigurations The VPC Lattice configuration for the service being created.

#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_task_set/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_create_task_set/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param service &#91;required&#93; The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service to
#' create the task set in.
#' @param cluster &#91;required&#93; The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that
#' hosts the service to create the task set in.
#' @param externalId An optional non-unique tag that identifies this task set in external
#' systems. If the task set is associated with a service discovery
#' registry, the tasks in this task set will have the
#' `ECS_TASK_SET_EXTERNAL_ID` Cloud Map attribute set to the provided
#' value.
#' @param taskDefinition &#91;required&#93; The task definition for the tasks in the task set to use. If a revision
#' isn't specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.
#' @param networkConfiguration An object representing the network configuration for a task set.
#' @param loadBalancers A load balancer object representing the load balancer to use with the
#' task set. The supported load balancer types are either an Application
#' Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer.
#' @param serviceRegistries The details of the service discovery registries to assign to this task
#' set. For more information, see [Service
#' discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html).
#' @param launchType The launch type that new tasks in the task set uses. For more
#' information, see [Amazon ECS launch
#' types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-configuration.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' If a `launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy` parameter
#' must be omitted.
#' @param capacityProviderStrategy The capacity provider strategy to use for the task set.
#' 
#' A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers
#' along with the `base` and `weight` to assign to them. A capacity
#' provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity
#' provider strategy. The
#' [`put_cluster_capacity_providers`][ecs_put_cluster_capacity_providers]
#' API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only
#' capacity providers with an `ACTIVE` or `UPDATING` status can be used.
#' 
#' If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType` parameter
#' must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or `launchType` is
#' specified, the `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is
#' used.
#' 
#' If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the
#' capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be
#' created with the
#' [CreateCapacityProviderProvider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/)API
#' operation.
#' 
#' To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the `FARGATE` or
#' `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are
#' available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster
#' to be used.
#' 
#' The
#' [`put_cluster_capacity_providers`][ecs_put_cluster_capacity_providers]
#' API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers
#' for a cluster after the cluster is created.
#' @param platformVersion The platform version that the tasks in the task set uses. A platform
#' version is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If
#' one isn't specified, the `LATEST` platform version is used.
#' @param scale A floating-point percentage of the desired number of tasks to place and
#' keep running in the task set.
#' @param clientToken An identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request.
#' It must be unique and is case sensitive. Up to 36 ASCII characters in
#' the range of 33-126 (inclusive) are allowed.
#' @param tags The metadata that you apply to the task set to help you categorize and
#' organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You
#' define both. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted.
#' 
#' The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
#' 
#' -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

#' @description
#' Lists the attributes for Amazon ECS resources within a specified target type and cluster.

#' default, only `ACTIVE` task definitions are listed. By setting this
#' parameter to `INACTIVE`, you can view task definitions that are
#' `INACTIVE` as long as an active task or service still references them.
#' If you paginate the resulting output, be sure to keep the `status` value
#' constant in each subsequent request.
#' @param sort The order to sort the results in. Valid values are `ASC` and `DESC`. By
#' default, (`ASC`) task definitions are listed lexicographically by family
#' name and in ascending numerical order by revision so that the newest
#' task definitions in a family are listed last. Setting this parameter to
#' `DESC` reverses the sort order on family name and revision. This is so
#' that the newest task definitions in a family are listed first.
#' @param nextToken The `nextToken` value returned from a
#' [`list_task_definitions`][ecs_list_task_definitions] request indicating
#' that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls
#' will be needed. If `maxResults` was provided, it is possible the number
#' of results to be fewer than `maxResults`.
#' 
#' This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used
#' to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
#' purposes.
#' @param maxResults The maximum number of task definition results that
#' [`list_task_definitions`][ecs_list_task_definitions] returned in
#' paginated output. When this parameter is used,
#' [`list_task_definitions`][ecs_list_task_definitions] only returns
#' `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response
#' element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by
#' sending another [`list_task_definitions`][ecs_list_task_definitions]
#' request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1
#' and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then
#' [`list_task_definitions`][ecs_list_task_definitions] returns up to 100
#' results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.

#' @description
#' Returns a list of tasks. You can filter the results by cluster, task definition family, container instance, launch type, what IAM principal started the task, or by the desired status of the task.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_list_tasks/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_list_tasks/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param cluster The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to use
#' when filtering the [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks] results. If you do not
#' specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.
#' @param containerInstance The container instance ID or full ARN of the container instance to use
#' when filtering the [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks] results. Specifying a
#' `containerInstance` limits the results to tasks that belong to that
#' container instance.
#' @param family The name of the task definition family to use when filtering the
#' [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks] results. Specifying a `family` limits the
#' results to tasks that belong to that family.
#' @param nextToken The `nextToken` value returned from a [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks]

#' @param maxResults The maximum number of task results that [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks]
#' returned in paginated output. When this parameter is used,
#' [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks] only returns `maxResults` results in a
#' single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining

#' value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't
#' used, then [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks] returns up to 100 results and
#' a `nextToken` value if applicable.
#' @param startedBy The `startedBy` value to filter the task results with. Specifying a
#' `startedBy` value limits the results to tasks that were started with
#' that value.
#' 
#' When you specify `startedBy` as the filter, it must be the only filter
#' that you use.
#' @param serviceName The name of the service to use when filtering the
#' [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks] results. Specifying a `serviceName`
#' limits the results to tasks that belong to that service.
#' @param desiredStatus The task desired status to use when filtering the
#' [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks] results. Specifying a `desiredStatus` of
#' `STOPPED` limits the results to tasks that Amazon ECS has set the
#' desired status to `STOPPED`. This can be useful for debugging tasks that
#' aren't starting properly or have died or finished. The default status
#' filter is `RUNNING`, which shows tasks that Amazon ECS has set the
#' desired status to `RUNNING`.
#' 
#' Although you can filter results based on a desired status of `PENDING`,
#' this doesn't return any results. Amazon ECS never sets the desired
#' status of a task to that value (only a task's `lastStatus` may have a
#' value of `PENDING`).

#'
#' @param name &#91;required&#93; The Amazon ECS account setting name to modify.
#' 
#' The following are the valid values for the account setting name.
#' 
#' -   `serviceLongArnFormat` - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name
#'     (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified
#'     user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in
#'     and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource
#'     separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined
#'     by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource.
#'     You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as
#'     resource tagging.
#' 
#' -   `taskLongArnFormat` - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
#'     and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user,
#'     role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and
#'     opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource

#' 
#' -   `awsvpcTrunking` - When modified, the elastic network interface
#'     (ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature
#'     is changed. If `awsvpcTrunking` is turned on, any new container
#'     instances that support the feature are launched have the increased
#'     ENI limits available to them. For more information, see [Elastic
#'     Network Interface
#'     Trunking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html)
#'     in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' -   `containerInsights` - Container Insights with enhanced observability
#'     provides all the Container Insights metrics, plus additional task
#'     and container metrics. This version supports enhanced observability
#'     for Amazon ECS clusters using the Amazon EC2 and Fargate launch
#'     types. After you configure Container Insights with enhanced
#'     observability on Amazon ECS, Container Insights auto-collects
#'     detailed infrastructure telemetry from the cluster level down to the
#'     container level in your environment and displays these critical
#'     performance data in curated dashboards removing the heavy lifting in
#'     observability set-up.
#' 
#'     To use Container Insights with enhanced observability, set the
#'     `containerInsights` account setting to `enhanced`.
#' 
#'     To use Container Insights, set the `containerInsights` account
#'     setting to `enabled`.
#' 
#'     For more information, see [Monitor Amazon ECS containers using
#'     Container Insights with enhanced
#'     observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html)
#'     in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' -   `dualStackIPv6` - When turned on, when using a VPC in dual stack
#'     mode, your tasks using the `awsvpc` network mode can have an IPv6
#'     address assigned. For more information on using IPv6 with tasks
#'     launched on Amazon EC2 instances, see [Using a VPC in dual-stack
#'     mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-awsvpc.html#task-networking-vpc-dual-stack).
#'     For more information on using IPv6 with tasks launched on Fargate,

#'     mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-task-networking.html#fargate-task-networking-vpc-dual-stack).
#' 
#' -   `fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod` - When Amazon Web Services
#'     determines that a security or infrastructure update is needed for an
#'     Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate, the tasks need to be stopped and
#'     new tasks launched to replace them. Use
#'     `fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod` to configure the wait time to
#'     retire a Fargate task. For information about the Fargate tasks
#'     maintenance, see [Amazon Web Services Fargate task
#'     maintenance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-maintenance.html)
#'     in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' -   `fargateEventWindows` - When Amazon Web Services determines that a
#'     security or infrastructure update is needed for an Amazon ECS task
#'     hosted on Fargate, the tasks need to be stopped and new tasks
#'     launched to replace them. Use `fargateEventWindows` to use EC2 Event
#'     Windows associated with Fargate tasks to configure time windows for
#'     task retirement.
#' 
#' -   `tagResourceAuthorization` - Amazon ECS is introducing tagging
#'     authorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for
#'     actions that create the resource, such as `ecsCreateCluster`. If
#'     tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services
#'     performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have
#'     permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit
#'     permissions to use the `ecs:TagResource` action. For more
#'     information, see [Grant permission to tag resources on
#'     creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/supported-iam-actions-tagging.html)
#'     in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' -   `defaultLogDriverMode` - Amazon ECS supports setting a default
#'     delivery mode of log messages from a container to the `logDriver`
#'     that you specify in the container's `logConfiguration`. The delivery
#'     mode affects application stability when the flow of logs from the
#'     container to the log driver is interrupted. The
#'     `defaultLogDriverMode` setting supports two values: `blocking` and
#'     `non-blocking`. If you don't specify a delivery mode in your
#'     container definition's `logConfiguration`, the mode you specify
#'     using this account setting will be used as the default. For more
#'     information about log delivery modes, see
#'     [LogConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_LogConfiguration.html).
#' 
#'     On June 25, 2025, Amazon ECS changed the default log driver mode
#'     from `blocking` to `non-blocking` to prioritize task availability
#'     over logging. To continue using the `blocking` mode after this
#'     change, do one of the following:
#' 
#'     -   Set the `mode` option in your container definition's
#'         `logConfiguration` as `blocking`.
#' 
#'     -   Set the `defaultLogDriverMode` account setting to `blocking`.
#' 
#' -   `guardDutyActivate` - The `guardDutyActivate` parameter is read-only
#'     in Amazon ECS and indicates whether Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring is
#'     enabled or disabled by your security administrator in your Amazon
#'     ECS account. Amazon GuardDuty controls this account setting on your
#'     behalf. For more information, see [Protecting Amazon ECS workloads
#'     with Amazon ECS Runtime
#'     Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-guard-duty-integration.html).
#' @param value &#91;required&#93; The account setting value for the specified principal ARN. Accepted
#' values are `enabled`, `disabled`, `enhanced`, `on`, and `off`.
#' 
#' When you specify `fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod` for the `name`, the
#' following are the valid values:
#' 
#' -   `0` - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and immediately
#'     retires the affected tasks.
#' 
#' -   `7` - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and waits 7
#'     calendar days to retire the tasks.
#' 
#' -   `14` - Amazon Web Services sends the notification, and waits 14
#'     calendar days to retire the tasks.
#' @param principalArn The ARN of the principal, which can be a user, role, or the root user.
#' If you specify the root user, it modifies the account setting for all
#' users, roles, and the root user of the account unless a user or role
#' explicitly overrides these settings. If this field is omitted, the
#' setting is changed only for the authenticated user.
#' 
#' In order to use this parameter, you must be the root user, or the
#' principal.
#' 
#' You must use the root user when you set the Fargate wait time
#' (`fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod`).
#' 
#' Federated users assume the account setting of the root user and can't
#' have explicit account settings set for them.

#' Registers a new task definition from the supplied family and
#' containerDefinitions
#'
#' @description
#' Registers a new task definition from the supplied `family` and `containerDefinitions`. Optionally, you can add data volumes to your containers with the `volumes` parameter. For more information about task definition parameters and defaults, see [Amazon ECS Task Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#'
#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_register_task_definition/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_register_task_definition/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param family &#91;required&#93; You must specify a `family` for a task definition. You can use it track
#' multiple versions of the same task definition. The `family` is used as a
#' name for your task definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and
#' lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed.
#' @param taskRoleArn The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that
#' containers in this task can assume. All containers in this task are
#' granted the permissions that are specified in this role. For more
#' information, see [IAM Roles for
#' Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param executionRoleArn The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants
#' the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make Amazon Web Services
#' API calls on your behalf. For informationabout the required IAM roles
#' for Amazon ECS, see [IAM roles for Amazon
#' ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/security-ecs-iam-role-overview.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param networkMode The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task. The
#' valid values are `none`, `bridge`, `awsvpc`, and `host`. If no network
#' mode is specified, the default is `bridge`.
#' 
#' For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the `awsvpc` network mode is required.
#' For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Linux instances, any network mode can
#' be used. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances,
#' `<default>` or `awsvpc` can be used. If the network mode is set to
#' `none`, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions,
#' and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The `host`
#' and `awsvpc` network modes offer the highest networking performance for
#' containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the
#' virtualized network stack provided by the `bridge` mode.
#' 
#' With the `host` and `awsvpc` network modes, exposed container ports are
#' mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the `host` network
#' mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the `awsvpc`
#' network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port
#' mappings.
#' 
#' When using the `host` network mode, you should not run containers using
#' the root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a non-root
#' user.
#' 
#' If the network mode is `awsvpc`, the task is allocated an elastic
#' network interface, and you must specify a
#' [NetworkConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_NetworkConfiguration.html)
#' value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition.
#' For more information, see [Task
#' Networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' If the network mode is `host`, you cannot run multiple instantiations of
#' the same task on a single container instance when port mappings are
#' used.
#' @param containerDefinitions &#91;required&#93; A list of container definitions in JSON format that describe the
#' different containers that make up your task.
#' @param volumes A list of volume definitions in JSON format that containers in your task
#' might use.
#' @param placementConstraints An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can
#' specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This limit includes
#' constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime.
#' @param requiresCompatibilities The task launch type that Amazon ECS validates the task definition
#' against. A client exception is returned if the task definition doesn't
#' validate against the compatibilities specified. If no value is
#' specified, the parameter is omitted from the response.
#' @param cpu The number of CPU units used by the task. It can be expressed as an
#' integer using CPU units (for example, `1024`) or as a string using vCPUs
#' (for example, `1 vCPU` or `1 vcpu`) in a task definition. String values
#' are converted to an integer indicating the CPU units when the task
#' definition is registered.
#' 
#' Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers.
#' We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows
#' containers.
#' 
#' If you're using the EC2 launch type or external launch type, this field
#' is optional. Supported values are between `128` CPU units (`0.125`
#' vCPUs) and `196608` CPU units (`192` vCPUs). If you do not specify a
#' value, the parameter is ignored.
#' 
#' This field is required for Fargate. For information about the valid
#' values, see [Task
#' size](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_size)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param memory The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task. It can be expressed as
#' an integer using MiB (for example ,`1024`) or as a string using GB (for
#' example, `1GB` or `1 GB`) in a task definition. String values are
#' converted to an integer indicating the MiB when the task definition is
#' registered.
#' 
#' Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers.
#' We recommend specifying container-level resources for Windows
#' containers.
#' 
#' If using the EC2 launch type, this field is optional.
#' 
#' If using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and you must
#' use one of the following values. This determines your range of supported
#' values for the `cpu` parameter.

#' The CPU units cannot be less than 1 vCPU when you use Windows containers
#' on Fargate.
#'

#' 
#' -   2048 (2 GB), 3072 (3 GB), 4096 (4 GB), 5120 (5 GB), 6144 (6 GB),
#'     7168 (7 GB), 8192 (8 GB) - Available `cpu` values: 1024 (1 vCPU)
#' 
#' -   Between 4096 (4 GB) and 16384 (16 GB) in increments of 1024 (1 GB) -
#'     Available `cpu` values: 2048 (2 vCPU)

#'     Available `cpu` values: 4096 (4 vCPU)
#' 
#' -   Between 16 GB and 60 GB in 4 GB increments - Available `cpu` values:
#'     8192 (8 vCPU)
#' 
#'     This option requires Linux platform `1.4.0` or later.

#'     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
#'     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
#'     your tags per resource limit.
#' @param pidMode The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid
#' values are `host` or `task`. On Fargate for Linux containers, the only
#' valid value is `task`. For example, monitoring sidecars might need
#' `pidMode` to access information about other containers running in the
#' same task.
#' 
#' If `host` is specified, all containers within the tasks that specified
#' the `host` PID mode on the same container instance share the same
#' process namespace with the host Amazon EC2 instance.
#' 
#' If `task` is specified, all containers within the specified task share
#' the same process namespace.
#' 
#' If no value is specified, the The default is a private namespace for

#' 
#' If the `host` PID mode is used, there's a heightened risk of undesired
#' process namespace exposure.
#' 
#' This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.
#' 
#' This parameter is only supported for tasks that are hosted on Fargate if
#' the tasks are using platform version `1.4.0` or later (Linux). This
#' isn't supported for Windows containers on Fargate.
#' @param ipcMode The IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task. The
#' valid values are `host`, `task`, or `none`. If `host` is specified, then
#' all containers within the tasks that specified the `host` IPC mode on
#' the same container instance share the same IPC resources with the host
#' Amazon EC2 instance. If `task` is specified, all containers within the
#' specified task share the same IPC resources. If `none` is specified,
#' then IPC resources within the containers of a task are private and not
#' shared with other containers in a task or on the container instance. If
#' no value is specified, then the IPC resource namespace sharing depends
#' on the Docker daemon setting on the container instance.
#' 
#' If the `host` IPC mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk
#' of undesired IPC namespace expose.
#' 
#' If you are setting namespaced kernel parameters using `systemControls`
#' for the containers in the task, the following will apply to your IPC
#' resource namespace. For more information, see [System
#' Controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' -   For tasks that use the `host` IPC mode, IPC namespace related
#'     `systemControls` are not supported.
#' 
#' -   For tasks that use the `task` IPC mode, IPC namespace related
#'     `systemControls` will apply to all containers within a task.
#' 
#' This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks run on
#' Fargate.
#' @param proxyConfiguration The configuration details for the App Mesh proxy.
#' 
#' For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the container instances
#' require at least version `1.26.0` of the container agent and at least
#' version `1.26.0-1` of the `ecs-init` package to use a proxy

#' is the family name of the task definition (for example,
#' `family:my-family-name`).
#' @param launchType The infrastructure to run your standalone task on. For more information,
#' see [Amazon ECS launch
#' types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-configuration.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the
#' `capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter and omit the `launchType`
#' request parameter.
#' 
#' The `FARGATE` launch type runs your tasks on Fargate On-Demand
#' infrastructure.
#' 
#' Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity provider
#' strategy must be used. For more information, see [Fargate capacity
#' providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-capacity-providers.html)
#' in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' The `EC2` launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered
#' to your cluster.
#' 
#' The `EXTERNAL` launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises server or
#' virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.
#' 
#' A task can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy. If
#' a `launchType` is specified, the `capacityProviderStrategy` parameter
#' must be omitted.
#' 
#' When you use cluster auto scaling, you must specify
#' `capacityProviderStrategy` and not `launchType`.
#' @param networkConfiguration The network configuration for the task. This parameter is required for
#' task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own
#' elastic network interface, and it isn't supported for other network
#' modes. For more information, see [Task
#' networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param overrides A list of container overrides in JSON format that specify the name of a
#' container in the specified task definition and the overrides it should
#' receive. You can override the default command for a container (that's
#' specified in the task definition or Docker image) with a `command`
#' override. You can also override existing environment variables (that are
#' specified in the task definition or Docker image) on a container or add
#' new environment variables to it with an `environment` override.
#' 
#' A total of 8192 characters are allowed for overrides. This limit
#' includes the JSON formatting characters of the override structure.
#' @param placementConstraints An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task. You can
#' specify up to 10 constraints for each task (including constraints in the
#' task definition and those specified at runtime).
#' @param placementStrategy The placement strategy objects to use for the task. You can specify a
#' maximum of 5 strategy rules for each task.
#' @param platformVersion The platform version the task uses. A platform version is only specified
#' for tasks hosted on Fargate. If one isn't specified, the `LATEST`
#' platform version is used. For more information, see [Fargate platform
#' versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform-fargate.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' @param propagateTags Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the
#' task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can
#' only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a
#' task after task creation, use the[`tag_resource`][ecs_tag_resource] API
#' action.
#' 
#' An error will be received if you specify the `SERVICE` option when
#' running a task.
#' @param referenceId This parameter is only used by Amazon ECS. It is not intended for use by
#' customers.
#' @param startedBy An optional tag specified when a task is started. For example, if you
#' automatically trigger a task to run a batch process job, you could apply
#' a unique identifier for that job to your task with the `startedBy`
#' parameter. You can then identify which tasks belong to that job by
#' filtering the results of a [`list_tasks`][ecs_list_tasks] call with the
#' `startedBy` value. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers,
#' hyphens (-), forward slash (/), and underscores (_) are allowed.
#' 
#' If a task is started by an Amazon ECS service, then the `startedBy`
#' parameter contains the deployment ID of the service that starts it.
#' @param tags The metadata that you apply to the task to help you categorize and
#' organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
#' which you define.
#' 
#' The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
#' 
#' -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
#' 
#' -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
#'     have only one value.
#' 
#' -   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
#' 
#' -   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
#' 
#' -   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
#'     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
#'     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
#'     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
#'     characters: + - = . _ : / @@.
#' 
#' -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
#' 
#' -   Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of
#'     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
#'     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
#'     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
#'     your tags per resource limit.
#' @param taskDefinition &#91;required&#93; The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task
#' definition to run. If a `revision` isn't specified, the latest `ACTIVE`
#' revision is used.
#' 
#' The full ARN value must match the value that you specified as the
#' `Resource` of the principal's permissions policy.
#' 
#' When you specify a task definition, you must either specify a specific
#' revision, or all revisions in the ARN.
#' 
#' To specify a specific revision, include the revision number in the ARN.
#' For example, to specify revision 2, use
#' `arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamilyName:2`.
#' 
#' To specify all revisions, use the wildcard (*) in the ARN. For example,
#' to specify all revisions, use
#' `arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111122223333:task-definition/TaskFamilyName:*`.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Policy Resources for Amazon

#' in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
#' @param clientToken An identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request.
#' It must be unique and is case sensitive. Up to 64 characters are
#' allowed. The valid characters are characters in the range of 33-126,
#' inclusive. For more information, see [Ensuring
#' idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/ECS_Idempotency.html).
#' @param volumeConfigurations The details of the volume that was `configuredAtLaunch`. You can

#' encryption in
#' [TaskManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TaskManagedEBSVolumeConfiguration.html).

#' See [https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_update_service/](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/ecs_update_service/) for full documentation.
#'
#' @param cluster The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that
#' your service runs on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default
#' cluster is assumed.
#' 
#' You can't change the cluster name.
#' @param service &#91;required&#93; The name of the service to update.
#' @param desiredCount The number of instantiations of the task to place and keep running in
#' your service.
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param taskDefinition The `family` and `revision` (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task
#' definition to run in your service. If a `revision` is not specified, the
#' latest `ACTIVE` revision is used. If you modify the task definition with
#' [`update_service`][ecs_update_service], Amazon ECS spawns a task with
#' the new version of the task definition and then stops an old task after
#' the new version is running.
#' 
#' This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
#' @param capacityProviderStrategy The details of a capacity provider strategy. You can set a capacity
#' provider when you create a cluster, run a task, or update a service.
#' 
#' If you want to use Amazon ECS Managed Instances, you must use the
#' `capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter.
#' 
#' When you use Fargate, the capacity providers are `FARGATE` or
#' `FARGATE_SPOT`.
#' 
#' When you use Amazon EC2, the capacity providers are Auto Scaling groups.
#' 
#' You can change capacity providers for rolling deployments and blue/green
#' deployments.
#' 
#' The following list provides the valid transitions:
#' 
#' -   Update the Fargate launch type to an Auto Scaling group capacity
#'     provider.
#' 
#' -   Update the Amazon EC2 launch type to a Fargate capacity provider.
#' 
#' -   Update the Fargate capacity provider to an Auto Scaling group
#'     capacity provider.
#' 
#' -   Update the Amazon EC2 capacity provider to a Fargate capacity
#'     provider.
#' 
#' -   Update the Auto Scaling group or Fargate capacity provider back to
#'     the launch type.
#' 
#'     Pass an empty list in the `capacityProviderStrategy` parameter.
#' 
#' For information about Amazon Web Services CDK considerations, see
#' [Amazon Web Services CDK
#' considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/update-service-parameters.html).
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param deploymentConfiguration Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during
#' the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param availabilityZoneRebalancing Indicates whether to use Availability Zone rebalancing for the service.
#' 
#' For more information, see [Balancing an Amazon ECS service across
#' Availability
#' Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-rebalancing.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* .
#' 
#' The default behavior of `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` differs between
#' create and update requests:
#' 
#' -   For create service requests, when no value is specified for
#'     `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults the value to
#'     `ENABLED`.
#' 
#' -   For update service requests, when no value is specified for
#'     `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults to the existing
#'     service’s `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value. If the service never
#'     had an `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value set, Amazon ECS treats
#'     this as `DISABLED`.
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param networkConfiguration An object representing the network configuration for the service.
#' 
#' This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
#' @param placementConstraints An array of task placement constraint objects to update the service to
#' use. If no value is specified, the existing placement constraints for
#' the service will remain unchanged. If this value is specified, it will
#' override any existing placement constraints defined for the service. To
#' remove all existing placement constraints, specify an empty array.
#' 
#' You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This limit
#' includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at
#' runtime.
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param placementStrategy The task placement strategy objects to update the service to use. If no
#' value is specified, the existing placement strategy for the service will
#' remain unchanged. If this value is specified, it will override the
#' existing placement strategy defined for the service. To remove an
#' existing placement strategy, specify an empty object.
#' 
#' You can specify a maximum of five strategy rules for each service.
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param platformVersion The platform version that your tasks in the service run on. A platform
#' version is only specified for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If a
#' platform version is not specified, the `LATEST` platform version is
#' used. For more information, see [Fargate Platform
#' Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform-fargate.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
#' @param forceNewDeployment Determines whether to force a new deployment of the service. By default,
#' deployments aren't forced. You can use this option to start a new
#' deployment with no service definition changes. For example, you can
#' update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker image with the same
#' image/tag combination (`my_image:latest`) or to roll Fargate tasks onto
#' a newer platform version.
#' @param healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler
#' ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing, VPC Lattice, and container
#' health checks after a task has first started. If you don't specify a
#' health check grace period value, the default value of `0` is used. If
#' you don't use any of the health checks, then
#' `healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` is unused.
#' 
#' If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to health
#' checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to
#' 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 69 years). During that time, the Amazon ECS
#' service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can
#' prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and
#' stopping them before they have time to come up.
#' 
#' If your service has more running tasks than desired, unhealthy tasks in
#' the grace period might be stopped to reach the desired count.
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param deploymentController 
#' @param enableExecuteCommand If `true`, this enables execute command functionality on all task
#' containers.
#' 
#' If you do not want to override the value that was set when the service
#' was created, you can set this to `null` when performing this action.
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param enableECSManagedTags Determines whether to turn on Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks in
#' the service. For more information, see [Tagging Your Amazon ECS
#' Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-using-tags.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' Only tasks launched after the update will reflect the update. To update
#' the tags on all tasks, set `forceNewDeployment` to `true`, so that
#' Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the updated tags.
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param loadBalancers You must have a service-linked role when you update this property
#' 
#' A list of Elastic Load Balancing load balancer objects. It contains the
#' load balancer name, the container name, and the container port to access
#' from the load balancer. The container name is as it appears in a
#' container definition.
#' 
#' When you add, update, or remove a load balancer configuration, Amazon
#' ECS starts new tasks with the updated Elastic Load Balancing
#' configuration, and then stops the old tasks when the new tasks are
#' running.
#' 
#' For services that use rolling updates, you can add, update, or remove
#' Elastic Load Balancing target groups. You can update from a single
#' target group to multiple target groups and from multiple target groups
#' to a single target group.
#' 
#' For services that use blue/green deployments, you can update Elastic
#' Load Balancing target groups by using ` CreateDeployment ` through
#' CodeDeploy. Note that multiple target groups are not supported for
#' blue/green deployments. For more information see [Register multiple
#' target groups with a
#' service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' For services that use the external deployment controller, you can add,
#' update, or remove load balancers by using
#' [`create_task_set`][ecs_create_task_set]. Note that multiple target
#' groups are not supported for external deployments. For more information
#' see [Register multiple target groups with a
#' service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html)
#' in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
#' 
#' You can remove existing `loadBalancers` by passing an empty list.
#' 
#' This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
#' @param propagateTags Determines whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the
#' service to the task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't
#' propagated.
#' 
#' Only tasks launched after the update will reflect the update. To update
#' the tags on all tasks, set `forceNewDeployment` to `true`, so that
#' Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the updated tags.
#' 
#' This parameter doesn't trigger a new service deployment.
#' @param serviceRegistries You must have a service-linked role when you update this property.
#' 
#' For more information about the role see the
#' [`create_service`][ecs_create_service] request parameter
#' [`role`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html#ECS-CreateService-request-role)

#' 
#' The details for the service discovery registries to assign to this
#' service. For more information, see [Service
#' Discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html).
#' 
#' When you add, update, or remove the service registries configuration,
#' Amazon ECS starts new tasks with the updated service registries
#' configuration, and then stops the old tasks when the new tasks are
#' running.
#' 
#' You can remove existing `serviceRegistries` by passing an empty list.
#' 
#' This parameter triggers a new service deployment.
#' @param serviceConnectConfiguration The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services,
#' and be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a
#' namespace.
#' 
#' Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services
#' in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the

#' Modifies which task set in a service is the primary task set

#' @description
#' Modifies which task set in a service is the primary task set. Any parameters that are updated on the primary task set in a service will transition to the service. This is used when a service uses the `EXTERNAL` deployment controller type. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Deployment Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

#' Updates the protection status of a task
#'
#' @description
#' Updates the protection status of a task. You can set `protectionEnabled` to `true` to protect your task from termination during scale-in events from [Service Autoscaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-auto-scaling.html) or [deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/).

#'
#' @param cluster &#91;required&#93; The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that
#' hosts the service that the task sets exist in.
#' @param tasks &#91;required&#93; A list of up to 10 task IDs or full ARN entries.
#' @param protectionEnabled &#91;required&#93; Specify `true` to mark a task for protection and `false` to unset
#' protection, making it eligible for termination.
#' @param expiresInMinutes If you set `protectionEnabled` to `true`, you can specify the duration
#' for task protection in minutes. You can specify a value from 1 minute to
#' up to 2,880 minutes (48 hours). During this time, your task will not be
#' terminated by scale-in events from Service Auto Scaling or deployments.
#' After this time period lapses, `protectionEnabled` will be reset to
#' `false`.
#' 
#' If you don’t specify the time, then the task is automatically protected
#' for 120 minutes (2 hours).
