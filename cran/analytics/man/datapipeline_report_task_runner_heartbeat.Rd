that they are operational}
\usage{
datapipeline_report_task_runner_heartbeat(taskrunnerId, workerGroup,
  hostname)
}
\arguments{
\item{taskrunnerId}{[required] The ID of the task runner. This value should be unique across your AWS
account. In the case of AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner launched on a
resource managed by AWS Data Pipeline, the web service provides a unique
identifier when it launches the application. If you have written a
custom task runner, you should assign a unique identifier for the task
runner.}

\item{workerGroup}{The type of task the task runner is configured to accept and process.
The worker group is set as a field on objects in the pipeline when they
are created. You can only specify a single value for \code{workerGroup}.
There are no wildcard values permitted in \code{workerGroup}; the string must
be an exact, case-sensitive, match.}

\item{hostname}{The public DNS name of the task runner.}
}
\description{
Task runners call \code{ReportTaskRunnerHeartbeat} every 15 minutes to
indicate that they are operational. If the AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner
is launched on a resource managed by AWS Data Pipeline, the web service
can use this call to detect when the task runner application has failed
and restart a new instance.
