#' AWS Budgets
#'
#' @description
#' The AWS Budgets API enables you to use AWS Budgets to plan your service
#' usage, service costs, and instance reservations. The API reference
#' provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the
#' actions and data types for AWS Budgets.
#' 
#' Budgets provide you with a way to see the following information:
#' 
#' -   How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier
#'     limits
#' 
#' -   Your usage-to-date, including how much you\'ve used of your Reserved
#'     Instances (RIs)
#' 
#' -   Your current estimated charges from AWS, and how much your predicted
#'     usage will accrue in charges by the end of the month
#' 
#' -   How much of your budget has been used
#' 
#' AWS updates your budget status several times a day. Budgets track your
#' unblended costs, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You can create the
#' following types of budgets:
#' 
#' -   **Cost budgets** - Plan how much you want to spend on a service.
#' 
#' -   **Usage budgets** - Plan how much you want to use one or more
#'     services.
#' 
#' -   **RI utilization budgets** - Define a utilization threshold, and
#'     receive alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This
#'     lets you see if your RIs are unused or under-utilized.
#' 
#' -   **RI coverage budgets** - Define a coverage threshold, and receive
#'     alerts when the number of your instance hours that are covered by
#'     RIs fall below that threshold. This lets you see how much of your
#'     instance usage is covered by a reservation.
#' 
#' Service Endpoint
#' 
#' The AWS Budgets API provides the following endpoint:
#' 
#' -   https://budgets.amazonaws.com
#' 
#' For information about costs that are associated with the AWS Budgets
#' API, see [AWS Cost Management
#' Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/).
