Description: Bindings to OpenSSL libssl and libcrypto, plus custom SSH key parsers.
    Supports RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384, P-521, and curve25519. Cryptographic
    signatures can either be created and verified manually or via x509 certificates. 
    AES can be used in cbc, ctr or gcm mode for symmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric
    (public key) encryption or EC for Diffie Hellman. High-level envelope functions 
    combine RSA and AES for encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key
    generators, hash functions (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a secure random
    number generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually performing crypto 
    calculations on large multibyte integers.
